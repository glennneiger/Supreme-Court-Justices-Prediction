            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136715">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-121, Richard L. Dugger v. Aubrey Dennis Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.546" offset="166808">You may proceed whenever you're ready, Ms. Roper.</text>

          <turn speaker="margene_a_roper" startTime="73.889" stopTime="127.994">
            <label>Ms. Margene A. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="73.889" offset="432212">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.561" offset="446945">Aubrey Dennis Adams, Jr. was convicted of the first degree strangulation murder of an eight-year old child in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.107" offset="481113">Eight years later, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, applying the principles enunciated by this Court in Caldwell v. Mississippi, vacated Adams' sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.926" offset="524372">We are before the Court today asking it to reverse the decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.859" offset="548091">Our position in the case and at issue in the case is our contention that the merits of the alleged Caldwell claim should never have been reached because of the abuse of the writ doctrine and because Adams had procedurally defaulted upon this claim in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.920" offset="616323">I would submit to the Court that the issue of abuse of the writ is before the Court and is fairly comprised within the question presented to the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="127.994" stopTime="134.580">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="127.994" offset="648611">Where was that raised in the cert petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="131.067" offset="660940">Would you tell me please?</text>

            <label>Ms. Margene A. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="134.580" offset="674942">The thrust of the entire cert petition, Your Honor, I would submit is that there was no significant change of law to excuse the application of all procedural barriers, and by that we meant not only the doctrine of procedural default, but abuse of the writ as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.431" offset="738367">And we would submit that the issue is fairly subsumed because any analysis this Court takes in regard to a change in law would have necessary applicability to the doctrine of abuse of the writ.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="161.697" stopTime="169.782">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="161.697" offset="783402">Well, that's a pretty specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.646" offset="787268">And I frankly have trouble seeing how it was raised in your cert petition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="margene_a_roper" startTime="169.782" stopTime="404.556">
            <label>Ms. Margene A. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="169.782" offset="815794">It was raised on the basis, I would submit, of a misapplication of the court below of the principles enunciated in Reed v. Ross which does deal with a change in law which is significant enough to constitute cause for procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.872" offset="884131">And necessarily any such change in law analysis would have application as well under the abuse of the writ doctrine as the advisory committee note indicates that a change in the law can excuse a failure to submit an issue in a first habeas petition as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.345" offset="950064">So, I think it could be argued in subsequent cases that this Court's rationale in this very case in both contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.618" offset="979112">So, I think it is subsumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.549" offset="986844">Also, I think that the Court does have jurisdiction in this case to notice plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.103" offset="1005025">And if the Court does find error in regard to there not being a change in law to excuse procedural default, I think it would apply as well across the board to the issue of abuse of the writ so that plain error could be noticed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.232" offset="1053613">The procedural history of the case reflects that Adams did not object to the trial judge's statements at the time of the actual trial in 1978 or on direct appeal in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.742" offset="1115680">The governor signed his first death warrant on Adams in 1984, and at that point in time Adams did not raise the instant claim in his state court attack collaterally on his judgment and sentence and he did not raise it in his first habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.921" offset="1180359">The issue was first raised for the first time in 1986 upon the signing of a second death warrant, and it was at that time presented to state and federal courts for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.549" offset="1226857">According to the principles enunciated in Reed v. Ross, I think it's clear that where the constitutional basis of a claim is not available to an attorney, then there is cause for his failure to not raise the claim in accordance with state procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.430" offset="1290387">And there is a concomitant advisory committee note in the area of habeas corpus litigation to Rule 9(b) which indicates that a change in law will also excuse the failure to present an issue in the first habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.220" offset="1349528">We... we would submit to the Court, however, that where there are tools available to construct a claim, that a court should not find that there is cause for a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.716" offset="1391533">Our position is that at the time of trial and on direct appeal there were necessary building blocks by which Aubrey Dennis Adams, Jr. could have fashioned and presented this claim to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.685" offset="1443360">And those building blocks grew as time progressed until there was quite a monumental stack of them at the time of Adams' first habeas petition in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.860" offset="1484111">We have chronicled the progression of the law in this area, and I don't want to dwell in length at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.325" offset="1509920">But I think a few comments are in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.708" offset="1519533">I would first note that if the comments are misleading, Adams needn't have awaited this Court's decision in Caldwell to set a principle that misleading comments should be objected to or are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.316" offset="1573972">If it was misleading, then at that point in time, Adams had a basis to frame an objection at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.629" offset="1595184">Moreover, if it can be argued or held that the comments were misleading on the basis of the Florida Supreme Court's decision in Tedder v. State, which indicates that a jury's recommendations should be given great weight by the trial judge, then at the time of trial Adams again had a basis to raise this objection because the Tedder decision was in existence at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.016" offset="1684731">I think it's clear that at the time of trial any competent litigator would have objected to statements which indicated that the jury needn't be considered... needn't consider or ruminate over the consequences of their verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.364" offset="1742096">I think that proposition would be clear to any attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.556" offset="1754844">Ms. Roper, do you think it's clear at the time of trial that if the objection had been made, the trial should... the trial court should have sustained the objection?</text>

            <text syncTime="422.517" offset="1826733">I'm saying that if error could arguably be found, then there was a basis for bringing that error to the attention of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.804" offset="1859856">My contention is that there was no error in the trial judge's statements in the first instance.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="494.024" offset="2112722">So, bottom line you don't think there's a valid Caldwell claim here anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.006" offset="2124738">So, we really don't have to go through all this procedural--</text>

          <turn speaker="margene_a_roper" startTime="499.329" stopTime="1267.310">
            <label>Ms. Margene A. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="499.329" offset="2133933">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.058" offset="2136859">And I'm not going to dwell at length on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.509" offset="2146681">This Court has noted the strong state law basis for it, and from a defendant's perspective, it doesn't matter to him whether his reversal is gained in a state or a federal court on state law grounds or federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.847" offset="2196000">So, I think that the fact that if there was a state law basis provides a basis for raising the claim in any context and there's no less potential for sandbagging by falling to raise a state law ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.747" offset="2251693">You can still hold that in abeyance, and the real issue is still delay just as in the case where a federal ground was not submitted to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.472" offset="2282517">So, I think that the state law basis is also a compelling consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.184" offset="2301430">But, more importantly, I think there was an Eighth Amendment basis, a clear Eighth Amendment basis, for this claim at the time of trial and even progressively more so at the time of his habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.042" offset="2348868">At the time of the habeas petition, In fact, Justice Stevens had indicated in a concurring opinion in Maggio the danger of a prosecutor advising a jury that an appellate court could correct any error.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.130" offset="2397143">And at that point in time the decision in California v. Ramos was out and all the other prior Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.236" offset="2433610">And as I pointed out in the brief, Caldwell himself was able to raise this claim based upon Ramos and other prior cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.522" offset="2466733">Another issue in the case is whether the Florida Supreme Court in regard to the procedural default actually found a third layer of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.642" offset="2519187">I... I think an examination of their opinion reflects that no other construction can be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.554" offset="2542906">The language in the opinion indicated that further, we find the presentation of these claims an abuse of the post-conviction procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.441" offset="2582403">Rule 3.850 was then set out and it was described as barring new claims as well as successive claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.824" offset="2608003">And the Florida Supreme Court then concluded and held that the new claims were barred as an abuse of procedure as well as by case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.841" offset="2639977">And the new Rule 3.850 is a... a codification of prior existing case law barring such new claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.795" offset="2675817">And I would also submit to the Court that contrary to the Respondent's position, Florida has regularly and consistently applied its procedural bars in the context of Caldwell claims being raised on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.124" offset="2729211">The court has discussed in its opinions the inapplicability of Caldwell only to demonstrate that no relief can be granted in this area on a 3.850, and it cannot be entertained because Caldwell is not a significant change of law, which is one of the criteria under our post-conviction relief procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.689" offset="2819386">Caldwell was discussed in the case of Garcia... excuse me... only to demonstrate the absence of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.298" offset="2861809">In that case it was contended by the Defendant that the trial judge gave too much weight to the jury's advisory sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.640" offset="2891275">So, in conclusion, the Florida Supreme Court has regularly and consistently applied its procedural bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.306" offset="2921891">Our contention is that even if the merits of the claim could be reached, Adams is still entitled to no relief because the claim is an adequate description of Florida sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.896" offset="2980196">During voir dire in this case, each time new prospective jurors were seated, the trial judge explained our capital sentencing system to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.941" offset="3020424">He advised them of the advisory nature of their sentencing recommendation and the fact that he could disregard it and sentence them to either life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.446" offset="3054488">In elaborating upon this, he indicated verbally to the jurors, distilled to its essence, the ultimate decision is on my conscience and rests upon my shoulders, not the jury's.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.047" offset="3108823">During voir dire, however, he also instructed the jury as to the finding and the weighing of aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.892" offset="3140274">Proceeding to the penalty phase, the jury was similarly again instructed under our standard instruction... excuse me that their recommendation is advisory in the final... the sole responsibility for the final determination rests upon the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.564" offset="3214880">At that point in time, however, they were also instructed that they must find sufficient aggravating circumstances not outweighed by the mitigating circumstances and that their verdict should be based on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.222" offset="3269528">More than that and most important to this case also is the fact that the trial judge drove home to them the importance and the gravity of their undertaking at that particular time in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.282" offset="3321773">He stated to them that they should not act hastily or without due regard to the gravity of these proceedings, and he instructed them to carefully weigh, sift and consider the evidence, and all of it, realizing that human life is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.661" offset="3387288">I don't think the jury could have any notion at all but their... their recommendation may have the possibility of sealing Adams' fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.228" offset="3425531">I think that that was driven home to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.698" offset="3431487">Moreover, the prosecutor admonished the jurors to be fair to the defendant and the people of the State of Florida, and that any way they decide will satisfy the people of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.008" offset="3476731">These statements were an accurate description of Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.428" offset="3490419">Under our death penalty statute, Florida statutes 921.141, a jury is directed to return an advisory recommendation, but the statute proceeds to state beyond that notwithstanding the recommendation, the court, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, shall enter a sentence of life imprisonment or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.652" offset="3575265">Under our statute then, the judge is the sentencer and not the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.366" offset="3594178">What the judge looks for from the jury is essentially in the nature of guidance alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.739" offset="3615598">And I think that his independent nature as the sentencer is reflected most aptly in a scenario where if the jury recommends death and the trial judge, applying the statutory criteria, cannot find an aggravating circumstance, he's constrained to impose a sentence of lite.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.542" offset="3702847">I think that reflects that he is, indeed, an independent and ultimate sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.966" offset="3720506">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.799" offset="3735866">I would further submit to the Court that these statements are not made inaccurate by the Florida Supreme Court decision in Tedder v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.615" offset="3771079">The Florida Supreme Court has recently indicated in the case of Combs v. State that in so holding in Tedder, it never meant to alter the clear statutory directive that the jury's recommendation is advisory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.053" offset="3832833">And they had, in fact, promulgated the standard jury instructions in question in this case after the Tedder decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.560" offset="3862926">Sos at best Tedder is either an appellate standard or simply an admonition to trial judges to carefully consider the jury's recommendation prior to their own independent findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.829" offset="3911931">I think the case would fall squarely within the ambit of California v. Ramos which does not prohibit the jury from being given accurate instructions rather than within the ambit of Caldwell v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.948" offset="3972431">And think the distinguishing factor is that in Caldwell v. Mississippi, this Court found the instructions to be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.410" offset="3998344">There is no danger of that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.302" offset="4009838">I think the State of Florida has a valid penalogical interest in having such information imparted to the jury because the state does not want its citizens' faith and the integrity of judicial and criminal proceedings destroyed by having them later find out, after they had served on a jury, that indeed they weren't true sentencers at all, they were simply advisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.490" offset="4102625">And I think that that would go a long way toward the people of our state losing faith in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.254" offset="4125717">And it has to be remembered also that the community voice that participates in the trial is also the community voice that's heard in the legislature as well when the legislature enacts and implements a death penalty statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.260" offset="4177753">So, we can't assume that the jury is ignorant of our statutory scheme in the first instance, and I don't think that we should be required to mislead them in any way as to their role in sentencing when they are, In fact, not sentencers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.540" offset="4230834">I think another valid state penalogical interest in having the jury learn or understand their role in our sentencing procedure is that it actually enhances the reliability of their deliberations because they understand their true role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.911" offset="4292274">And not only that, but I think the questioning and such knowledge, even if it's imparted to them at the penalty phase, but most particularly during voir dire, would go toward including within a jury those... those jurors who may be death-scrupled to the degree that they could not impose a sentence of death if theirs was the final verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.082" offset="4377015">If they realized that their sentence... or advisory sentence was simply a recommendation, then they could impose a sentence of death and would be included on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.260" offset="4417662">That's another valid state interest and an interest that really accrues to the benefit of the defendant is the goal of achieving a cross section of the community anti having life-prone, as well as jurors who are more retributive, make a final determination as to a defendant's fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.092" offset="4489028">And I don't think such an instruction would cause any sort of bias under the four-prong bias analysis of this Court in the Caldwell decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.158" offset="4525286">There is no danger that the jury might not understand the limited nature of appellate review because, in fact, the judge is the ultimate sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.683" offset="4559350">The jury can't send a message of disapproval to the community or a higher authority because of the fact that the jury is not in the first place a recognized sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.191" offset="4601459">And even if it had a desire to send such a message of disapproval, that message can't get past the trial judge because he is the sentencer and he makes his own independent determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.838" offset="4648062">The judge in Florida can overrule a life sentencer not only a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.783" offset="4667811">So, there would be no urge on the part of the jury at all to delegate its duty by returning a death sentence because it could delegate its duty by returning a life sentence as well and there would, further, be no reasons for a juror who was reluctant to vote tar death in a deadlock situation to capitulate to demands because of this same fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.095" offset="4748999">I think the real issue in this case... and it has been made clear in subsequent Eleventh Circuit opinions... is the contention that it is the voir dire statements alone which are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.723" offset="4795602">The Eleventh Circuit in Harich v. Wainwright has indicated that there is no Caldwell claim presented at all in regard to the penalty phase instructions that the jury can be told of the advisory nature of its sentencing recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.825" offset="4855997">So, that would not implicate our sentencing... or penalty phase instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.488" offset="4874596">And other cases in the Eleventh Circuit have indicated that the error they perceive in this case is the trial judge's statements at voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.770" offset="4903748">Now, I would submit to the Court that if it is correct, which the lower court is even now in agreement with, state and federal, that the judge is the ultimate sentencer, then as a matter of logic, the decision is on his conscience and it is on his shoulders, and that even these voir dire statements were a correct statement of Florida law as a matter of logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.185" offset="4993401">It's our further position that it these statements could be seen to fit within the prohibition enunciated in Caldwell by this Court, that any such error would be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.965" offset="5044496">And for the same reasons such error would be harmless, prejudice was not demonstrated by Adams below to overcome a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.610" offset="5079082">In the first place in this case, voir dire took place on October 12 through October 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.674" offset="5107399">The penalty phase did not occur until October 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.317" offset="5121923">Thus, there was a... a lapse between voir dire and sentencing of almost 11 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.151" offset="5145224">I think this Court noted in its recent case of Darden v. Wainwright in a footnote that the fact that these comments occurred during the guilt-innocent stage lessened any chance at all that they had an effect on sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.469" offset="5202589">In this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.709" offset="5427451">The statement of the Florida Supreme Court is quoted in... in Respondent's brief where the Florida Supreme Court in reversing the trial judge's sentence which ignored the recommendation said under the state's theory, there would be little or no need for a jury's advisory recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.769" offset="5487742">This is not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.049" offset="5492862">Sub judice, the jury's recommendation of life was reasonably based on valid mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.073" offset="5516999">The fact that reasonable could differ renders the override improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.267" offset="5533717">That sounds to me like more than a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.480" offset="5542599">It sounds to me he has to accept it if a reasonable person could... could make that recommendation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.263" offset="5561721">Again, that's extraneous appellate language, and as I said before, if Tedder represents anything at all, It's either an admonition to trial judges or an appellate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.150" offset="5601218">It's not a direction to trial judges in the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.022" offset="5612712">They're compelled under our statute to independently find whether death is a appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.636" offset="5639252">The Ferry case I think stands out because Ferry walked into a grocery store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.979" offset="5660568">He threw gasoline on numbers of people and set them on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.151" offset="5677286">I think mental illness has always been considered by all courts to be an extremely strong mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.527" offset="5706753">And the Florida Supreme Court stated in Ferry that he was extremely mental ill, and I... mentally ill, and I think that that was the overriding consideration in that case, that it was just so obvious, although they may chastise the judge, it should have been obvious to him, aside from what the jury recommended,--</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.239" offset="5777597">I would also submit to the Court that the error in this case is harmless, and prejudice hasn't been demonstrated for the further reason that the subsequent instructions to the jury drove home to them quite clearly the gravity of their undertaking, particularly the later statement by the trial judge to carefully weigh, sift and consider the evidence, and all of it, considering that human life is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.505" offset="5874668">So, I think that aside from any voir dire statements, the jury certainly had driven home to them the gravity of their undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.562" offset="5906955">Also, Adams has not demonstrated and cannot demonstrate that he's innocent of any aggravating factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.397" offset="5938302">The murder under Florida law is clearly heinous, atrocious and cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.901" offset="5956274">It was committed during an attempted rape by Adams' own confession and during a kidnapping and to avoid lawful arrest, as his confession also indicated, that the child was screaming, and he put his hand over her mouth to silence her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.810" offset="6011863">The lower court found it compelling that there was a balance of aggravating and mitigating factors, but I would submit to the Court that that's not the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.425" offset="6046344">This jury deliberated for only one-half hour before recommending that Adams be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.149" offset="6069228">I think the heinousness of this crime just leaps out from... from the sentencing order aside from any mere numerical balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.126" offset="6101202">And I would submit that that's all it is is a numerical balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.923" offset="6208304">I think what the Florida Supreme Court is saying is... again, the answer I have for it is that it's an appellate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.488" offset="6234635">It's the same sort of standard that was set forth in Tedder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.732" offset="6251562">I think you have to consider the Florida Supreme Court's other statements, especially in Combs, that they didn't mean to detract from the clear statutory directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.939" offset="6296388">I think when the Florida Supreme Court finds error, it's judicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.373" offset="6314152">And I don't think anything bespeaks of this more than the actual Tedder decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.298" offset="6333900">In Tedder, the court later went on to indicate that two of the aggravating factors were invalid in Tedder and that they would have been constrained to reverse under a proportionality analysis in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.804" offset="6383846">So, I think the Florida Supreme Court basically determines whether it is the trial judge who has erred or not and the other language is extraneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.430" offset="6418433">It's a appellate standard or an admonition to the judges to... to more carefully consider the guidance offered by the jury, but that doesn't mean that the jury's recommendation, as this Court recognized in Spaziano, rises to the level of a judgment or makes the jury a presumptive sentencer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.948" offset="6528460">I think that one preliminary matter that has really been overlooked in the State's argument is when they talk about a procedural bar here, is there simply was no independent or adequate State ground in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.397" offset="6586243">As unanimously held by the Eleventh Circuit, based on its special familiarity with Florida jurisprudence, Florida's rule is not one of strict forfeiture of claims not raised at trial or on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.358" offset="6642145">There is a provision for new constitutional holdings of either this Court or the Florida Supreme Court and for fundamental constitutional error to be considered even if not raised at trial or on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.645" offset="6695226">The Eleventh Circuit's opinion gives examples of that, this Court's holding in Enmund, a situation where the state had withheld evidence helpful to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.851" offset="6732111">And this exception also applies here to allow consideration of Mr. Adams' Caldwell claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.017" offset="6760741">The problem is that the Florida Supreme Court, because of its erroneous view of the merits, has not recognized that the exception applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.525" offset="6794805">That this is, in fact, the reason why they have not applied the exception here is illustrated by the Florida Supreme Court's treatment of Lockett claims before and after this Court's decision last year in Hitchcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.942" offset="6848408">Before Hitchcock, the Florida Supreme Court applied the procedural bar to stop claims of people whose trials had occurred after 1978 saying you had... if this claim had any basis, which we don't think it does, but if it did have any merit, you had basis under our state law decision in a case called Songer and under Lockett to make this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.376" offset="6938165">But we're going to not consider the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.548" offset="6950808">And they so held in a case called Copeland, 505 So.2d 425 (1987).</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.514" offset="6978707">Then shortly after that this Court unanimously informed the Florida Supreme Court and the rest of the world in the Hitchcock decision that the Florida Supreme Court's view of the merits of that claim were wrong, and that in fact there had been a constitutional violation under Hitchcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.664" offset="7047357">Then what did the Florida Supreme Court do after that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.578" offset="7062926">Very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.350" offset="7066060">They have now gone and considered the merits of all Hitchcock claims, including ones for trials after 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.155" offset="7101273">In fact, the Combs case which Ms. Roper cited for its discussion of the Caldwell issue, is an example of a trial that occurred after 1978 in which the Florida Supreme Court, following this Court's decision in Hitchcock, said, Hitchcock is a sufficient change in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.846" offset="7172013">Therefore, we will now consider the merits and rule in favor of your Lockett claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.002" offset="7628633">What I am prepared to say is that if, contrary to the usual practice of this Court, it were somehow to leap out and decide that issue in this case, that in this case, under the circumstances here, it should be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.001" offset="7684640">But I don't think that's necessary to a decision of this case just as the other side stated in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.717" offset="7707523">I also think that, to finish my analysis, that the real problem here, as is pointed out by what they have done in the Hitchcock situation is that the Florida Supreme Court does not recognize the applicability of Caldwell to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.857" offset="7780039">They criticize the decision of the Eleventh Circuit in Combs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.769" offset="7795713">If they do realize, based on a decision today by this Court on the merits, that as they were wrong in Hitchcock, they are also wrong here, then to be consistent with what they have done in the Hitchcock situation, they would also have to apply their new law exception here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.459" offset="7854540">In fact, they have pretty much hinted as much in a case called Card v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.482" offset="7874602">They said, well, we're not going to consider your Caldwell claim because the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Adams and in Mann is not come under our new law exception because only decisions of the United States Supreme Court or the Florida Supreme Court would come under that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.645" offset="7943252">Well, that all but says that if this Court now reaches the merits and tells them again that they were wrong, as I believe they clearly are wrong, on the merits, then they will apply their exception and they will consider such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.395" offset="8002289">And it would be anomalous were only Mr. Adams not to get the benefit of the holding established in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.498" offset="8022664">Thus, as the Eleventh Circuit concluded, the Florida Supreme Court is either relying on its mistaken view of the federal constitutional law or is inconsistently applying its procedural bar, and either way, there is no independent and adequate state ground in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.851" offset="8096016">Now, I'd also like to point out that, as was suggested in Justice O'Connor's questioning, there is no abuse of the writ issue presented in the cert petition and, in fact, even the amicus curiae who favored the State of Florida in this case, when they purported to rearticulate the two issues in this case, said that the two issues were the merits of the Caldwell claim and procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.216" offset="8193505">So, even they did not perceive what isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.537" offset="8206775">Now, turning back to the merits, as you may well know from reading the brief, the judge in this case instructed the jury no less than 11 times that the sentencing decision was in no way whatsoever the jury's responsibility, did not fall on its shoulders, and that the imposition of the death sentence would not be on its conscience, but solely on his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.683" offset="8311370">He said I don't want you to feel that you determine whether he lives or dies because you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.149" offset="8333208">And he repeatedly said that I can disregard your recommendation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.835" offset="11299987">So, I submit that when you take what they have done with the Hitchcock claims before and after Caldwell... and before and after Hitchcock, I should say, you will see an exact parallel to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.293" offset="11357874">And there simply is no independent and adequate state ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.846" offset="11372085">I would also submit that on the record of this case, it is one in which a reasonable juror who accurately understood what the jury's important role is in capital sentencing where in reality most of the time where there is an override by the judge, the judge is himself overridden, a jury that had this on its conscience could reasonably have voted a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.666" offset="11491308">And if they had done so, and even if it... that had been overridden, the override would itself have been overridden by the Florida Supreme Court because as it was, the trial judge found that there were three mitigating circumstances, as well as three aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.065" offset="11556927">And in the Florida Supreme Court even without an override, there were two justices who dissented on the ground that in similar Florida cases, where hopefully the juries did understand their responsibility, life was the sentence that was usually granted on facts like these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.418" offset="11622338">In this kind of circumstance, I submit the violation is even worse than in Caldwell because the person who was repeatedly undermining the jury's responsibility was the trial judge, and he was telling them that the fact that it was not on their conscience is the most important thing that they should remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.748" offset="11695690">Yet, under Florida law, the jury is given such great weight because it is the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.234" offset="11725574">And nobody stepped in to stress the importance of the jury's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.385" offset="11742188">I also submit that there is prejudice in this case because of what I have just stated about what would have occurred had the misstatement not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.238" offset="11809584">On the rest of the subject of cause, I should also note briefly that, as stated in our brief, there simply was no court anywhere... that we have found anywhere in the country that came up with an Eighth Amendment decision anything like Caldwell at the time of the trial or appeal in this case, unlike the situation in Smith v. Murray or in Engle v. Isaac.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.861" offset="11900072">And in fact, there isn't one rejecting such a claim because we have not seen any indication that anybody anywhere in the country at that time had formulated such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.457" offset="11934449">And I submit that in that kind of circumstances the cause is not resent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.971" offset="11956496">I have explained again why I believe abuse of the writ is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.847" offset="11980006">If there are questions further at this point, I'd be happy to answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.978" offset="11996620">Otherwise, I'd like to thank the Court for its attention.</text>

            <label>Ms. Margene A. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="2972.452" offset="12026504">I would just like to briefly respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.625" offset="12043118">I would submit to the Court that consideration of cases raising claims other than Caldwell claims in the context of determining whether there's independent and adequate state ground is of no moment to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.225" offset="12093587">Engle v. Isaac indicated that federal courts should honor state procedural rules as well as rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.978" offset="12124620">And I think Florida's post-conviction rule, Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, has to be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.992" offset="12148653">In the same context, I think the Florida Supreme Court, like a federal court, has the right to develop its own evolving notions of what constitutes fundamental error and what they can and cannot entertain on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.991" offset="12200584">In regard to these cases, however, particularly the Hitchcock cases, I would point out to the Court that the Florida Supreme Court did regularly and consistently bar Hitchcock claims until it perceived that a change of law was imposed upon it by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.551" offset="12258890">In the actual Copeland case, Copeland was taken before this Court and this Court reversed and stated that Florida should look at Copeland again for a Hitchcock violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.717" offset="12299536">In regard to a basis for raising the claim counsel just most recently discussed, I think that California v. Ramos stands out first and foremost at the time of his filing his first habeas petition as authority for raising this claim and even discussed hypothetically a Eighth Amendment situation whereby the jury could be instructed that the governor had the power to commute a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.593" offset="12395040">And I don't think there's a requirement that a claim have to be... a claim has to be meritorious or there has to be an assured victory in order to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.640" offset="12435268">That doesn't comport with the idea that a basis for a claim is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.461" offset="12450524">And Caldwell had the basis himself on... to raise this claim and brought it before the Court on the basis of Ramos and other existing Eighth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.007" offset="12484692">Thank you.</text>
