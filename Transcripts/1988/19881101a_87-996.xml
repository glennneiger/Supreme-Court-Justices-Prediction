            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149874">We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 87-996, Coit Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="189267">Mr. Goodfriend, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_goodfriend" startTime="13.891" stopTime="217.007">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Goodfriend</label>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="205358">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.110" offset="218210">This case involves the so-called Hudspeth Doctrine, a rule of law that was announced by the Fifth Circuit in 1985 and that effectively closes the courthouse door to creditors of insolvent savings and loans that have been placed in receivership by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which I will refer to hereafter as FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.475" offset="307758">Under the so-called Hudspeth Doctrine, at least as it was originally conceived, a creditor's claim must first be presented to FSLIC, then any adverse ruling appealed to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and thereafter any adverse determination reviewed by the courts under a very limited standard of review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.205" offset="394694">This case began when Coit, a real estate partnership, sued FirstSouth, a federal savings and loan, in state court, suing FirstSouth for usury, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing in connection with two real estate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.868" offset="469299">The case remained in state court for approximately two months at which time FirstSouth became insolvent and was placed in receivership by FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.308" offset="511095">Thereafter, FSLIC's move to dismiss the case from federal court under the Hudspeth Doctrine, which motion was granted, and Coit took an appeal to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.282" offset="554981">The Fifth Circuit affirmed relying on its prior decisions under the Hudspeth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="574938">This Court then granted a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="586746">A conflict presently exists between the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits on the Hudspeth Doctrine, the Ninth Circuit having rejected the Hudspeth Doctrine in the Morrison-Knudsen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.843" offset="629169">Now, the issue has changed somewhat from what it was when this Court initially granted a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.016" offset="661874">Initially this case involved the question of whether Congress by statutes had ousted the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction to hear a broad range of creditor or claims against an insolvent savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.776" offset="716940">In so ruling, the Fifth Circuit relied on two statutory provisions: 12 U.S.C. 1464(d)(6)(C) which has the restrain or affect language, and 12 U.S.C. 29(d) which makes FSLIC's appointment as receiver</text>
            <text syncTime="158.218" offset="782664">"subject only to the regulation of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. "</text>
            <text syncTime="161.737" offset="796770">A recent Law Review article in the Western New England Law Review, which we have sent the Court, extensively reviews the legislative history of these provisions and I think presents convincing legislative history that neither of these provisions has anything to do with the jurisdiction of the courts to hear creditor claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.651" offset="880467">The restrain or affect language was inserted initially to limit challenges by the savings and loan itself and by its directors to the appointment of FSLIC as receiver limiting those challenges to a 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.510" offset="939817">And that's specifically in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.445" offset="951624">And the subject only to the regulation of the Board language was apparently inserted in response to a special situation which arose in the State of Illinois where a state court-appointed receiver ignored FSLIC's request for information and FSLIC's monetary claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Goodfriend</label>
            <text syncTime="281.930" offset="1277528">We... we reject both the initial position of the Fifth Circuit, which was a subject matter jurisdiction position, and we also reject the revised position of the Solicitor General which concerns agency-mandated exhaustion, which we wish to clearly distinguish from court-mandated exhaustion, which was referred to somewhat in the Morrison-Knudsen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.746" offset="1364777">We think the implications of agency-mandated exhaustion are very different from judicial exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.649" offset="1392467">The Solicitor General has revised the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.934" offset="1413574">He no longer takes the position that this is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, and he no longer takes the position that FSLIC has the power to adjudicate creditor claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.873" offset="1449309">What he does say... and I think this is the nub of the case... is that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has the power to promulgate regulations under section 5(d)(11) of the Homeowner's Loan Act to mandate that creditors exhaust their administrative remedies before FSLIC and the Board before seeking review in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.954" offset="1529662">We think that the Solicitor General contemplates de novo review after completion of the exhaustion process, but his position in this regard is not entirely clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.748" offset="1600819">Initially that... that was my thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.784" offset="1612940">But what we submit, Your Honor, is where the delay in agency-mandated jurisdiction is undue, as it has been in these cases, so that ultimate judicial review may be ineffective or worthless to a litigant, Article III concerns and Seventh Amendment concerns are still in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.698" offset="1688591">As for the due process question, the constitutional due process question of the absence of a disinterested tribunal, that is very definitely still in the case because this Court has held in Gibson v. Berryhill and in Ward v. Monroeville that a party is entitled to a disinterested tribunal at the first level even if he subsequently obtains de novo judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.825" offset="2117103">Now, it does depend upon the priorities whether I think you're on a higher level of priorities or low level of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.764" offset="2152839">And quite frankly, FSLIC's priorities in this regard are not clear except for the fact that in certain states they have promulgated a regulation recently whereby they have placed themselves in the position where they can recover on their subrogation claims first ahead of every other creditor, we think a very questionable ruling on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.594" offset="2232147">We also say, Your Honor, that we are potentially threatened every day by foreclosure on our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.550" offset="2267987">The situation there is that the receiver had at one earlier point, in fact, about two weeks before the Fifth Circuit ruled in this case, posted Coit's property for foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.806" offset="2309051">We then petitioned the Board under the expedited claims procedure to stay that posting of the foreclosure, and before the Board could act, FSLIC voluntarily withdrew its claim without prejudice to reinstating it at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.535" offset="2375925">So, I could leave this podium today, go back to my office in Dallas and find out that FSLIC is foreclosing on my client's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.040" offset="2406018">And nothing prevents them from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.992" offset="2417825">The only thing I can do is go back to the Board and ask them for discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.944" offset="2429632">So, we say that that constant threat and the wasting nature of this asset not only... makes even the constitutional claims ripe for review at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.976" offset="2837770">It covers antitrust claims, securities claims, employment discrimination claims, RICO, and under state law a breach of contract, fraud, usury, even personal injury claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.441" offset="2939543">Further, the Board has defined in its regulations the concept of claims so broadly that it includes compulsory counterclaims and even affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.983" offset="2977786">If FSLIC goes into court and sues my client on a note, which they could do in this case, foreclose on the property and sue on the deficiency, or on a contract, as they did in Mr. Hudspeth's case, he may not... the defendant may not counterclaim or set off his own claims against FSLIC in... in court, but must, according to the Hudspeth Doctrine, raise his counterclaims or even some courts have held his affirmative defense by way of offset in the administrative proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.670" offset="6552486">Well, as far as I know, Your Honor, under the National Bank Act, there is no exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.188" offset="6566592">In fact, as we have pointed out in our brief, there is a voluntary claims procedure before the FDIC, and a creditor who, say, has a small claim and doesn't want to incur the expense of... of litigation can go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.531" offset="6615912">But the fact that that claims procedure exists and the fact that the receiver may impose a bar date in a bank liquidation does not prevent a creditor of a national bank in receivership under FDIC from having his claim determined in federal or state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.641" offset="6684352">And that discrimination I believe between creditors of savings and loans and creditors of banks I think is going to upset the careful balance that Congress has crafted between savings and loans and banks and other financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.133" offset="6742344">And one of the reasons that the U.S. Savings League, the trade association of the largest number of savings and loans in this country, is here in this Court filing an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Coit and against the regulatory agency that regulates savings and loans is that they fear that the Hudspeth Doctrine is going to cause businessmen in the future to prefer banks and other financial institutions over savings and loans when it comes to engaging in new business transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.086" offset="6862194">And we think savings and loans are going to be... and apparently they do to... going to be seriously hurt by the existence of the Hudspeth Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.259" offset="6890824">We also think that the Hudspeth Doctrine threatens the security of many homeowners in this country who, because of the limited nature of review for foreclosure proceedings, actually stand at risk if their mortgages are held by savings and loans because if FSLIC posts their home for foreclosure, even mistakenly, and they don't meet that five-day window, their property can be taken and no court in the land under the Hudspeth Doctrine can come to their aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.111" offset="7014227">So, we believe that this is a sweeping doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.515" offset="7031885">And we believe if that if the Board wishes to contravene the rights of these litigants to avail themselves of express jurisdictional grants from Congress and to shorten federal and state statutes of limitations, then the Board has the burden to show that Congress intended to make an exception where insolvent savings and loans are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.945" offset="7113596">We believe if any lesser standard were used, then every federal agency could require exhaustion simply by adopting a regulation to that effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="1754.236" offset="7166782">Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.495" offset="7223833">The savings and loan industry is presently facing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.233" offset="7250792">The Federal Home Loan Bank Board estimates that at least 400 federally insured savings and loan institutions are insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.922" offset="7277541">And the Bank Board, which itself is facing serious financial constraints, has already ordered the liquidation of 85 other hopelessly insolvent institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.909" offset="7309410">The liquidation process is just beginning, and already there are thousands of claims seeking billions of dollars against just these 85 thrifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.182" offset="7342534">Those claims are pressed by a wide variety of interests, including defaulting borrowers like Coit, who claim that they are not obligated to pay back their loans and that the lender, in fact, should pay them damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.655" offset="7384434">This case presents an extraordinarily important, albeit it narrow, question, namely, what is the first step in the process for resolving these thousands of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.345" offset="7423200">We submit that claims against an insolvent thrift that has been placed in Federal receivership must be presented to the receiver in the first instance for allowance or disallowance before the claimant can seek a judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.986" offset="7469802">The circuit courts that have tolled in this vineyard all recognize the concepts of primary jurisdiction or exhaustion of remedies apply, but they have differed with respect to whether a claimant must always participate in the administrative process before seeking judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.394" offset="7523405">The Third, Fifth and the Seventh Circuits require a mandatory resort to the Bank Board's claims procedure where the Ninth Circuit's Morrison-Knudsen decision held that a trial court should consider whether recourse to that process is appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.469" offset="7579725">We submit, based on the logic and language of the relevant statutes, that a claim... a claimant is required to participate in the Bank Board's claims process and that any other result would have disastrous consequences for the orderly liquidation of a failed thrift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.431" offset="7651510">No, Your Honor, we do not say that there's a statute that expressly requires exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.717" offset="7668646">The exhaustion requirement, in fact, is implicit in the statutory scheme that is set up by the Homeowner's Loan Act and the National Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.156" offset="7694455">Section 5(d)(6) of the Homeowner's Act gives the Bank Board exclusive power to reorganize or liquidate an insolvent thrift using FSLIC as receiver for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.129" offset="7742312">Section 5(d)(11) then broadly states that the Board shall have power to make rules and regulations for the liquidation of associations and the conduct of receiverships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.318" offset="7779092">Congress, in short, gave the Bank Board broad power to design and put into effect an administrative process in lieu of the Title XI bankruptcy procedures for liquidating failed thrift institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.424" offset="7823500">And here, as in de la Cuesta, it would have been difficult for Congress to have given the Bank Board a broader mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.017" offset="12217923">In that case a liquidating agent is appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.703" offset="12228685">The liquidating agent has authority to pass on claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.988" offset="12241747">When he makes... first of all, all the parties are required to submit their claims to the liquidating agent within a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.844" offset="12273198">It's longer than the... than the FSLIC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.313" offset="12287095">But if a party does not submit his claim, he is precluded from any participation in the distribution of the receivership assets until all of the other claimants who have timely filed have been paid off in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.972" offset="12337668">Now, after the party submits his claim to the liquidating agent, the liquidating agent makes a determination on that, on that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.209" offset="12366612">If he determines to disallow the claim, the party is then entitled to bring a suit in state court in a particular county, mind you, in Travis County, to in fact litigate that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.100" offset="12410184">Now, that's not far removed from what the receiver is asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.718" offset="12424708">And, indeed, it would be quite anomalous if in the case of federal receiverships, no such protection is given, but in the case of state receiverships, that protection is available when they are liquidated through the state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.442" offset="12471624">There are other anomalies that result from Coit's position that I must point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.179" offset="12494507">Absent a centralized process requiring presentation of claims, FSLIC would have to wait until the expiration of the longest period... the longest possible statute of limitations before it could even determine the total amount of claims that face the receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.939" offset="12553544">FSLIC, accordingly, would be unable to begin even partial distribution of assets until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.241" offset="12570785">Under these circumstances, it's clear that FSLIC would have great difficulty in making even interim distributions because it must wait until it has all the claims before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.388" offset="12651347">As I pointed out before, some receiverships have no assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.090" offset="12662214">In other cases, individual claimants are each pursuing their claim without regard to others and, in fact, are exhausting the receivership assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.244" offset="12690844">Now, that certainly is not in the best interest of an orderly liquidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.664" offset="12716444">Now, Colt has raised several other objections here to the... to this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.254" offset="12742880">And one of those is the question of foreclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.872" offset="12753329">And the fact of the matter is that FSLIC gives as much protection to foreclosures as the states often give.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.026" offset="12777884">A party is entitled upon receiving notice of a foreclosure to seek a stay on an expedited basis from the Bank Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.846" offset="12809231">If the Bank Board rejects that stay, the party then has an opportunity to seek judicial review before the foreclosure takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.952" offset="12837652">In this particular case, there was a notice of foreclosure, and based on the... the litigation, the ongoing litigation, and other matters as well, FSLIC has determined not to foreclose on that property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.014" offset="12925841">But in most states now, there are nonjudicial procedures for foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.585" offset="12940156">And as for the... with respect to the claim-counterclaim controversy, there is no reason to believe that the administrative claims process will inevitably lead to the resolution of FSLIC claims and creditor counterclaims in different forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.308" offset="12995014">When FSLIC is litigating a claim against a receivership claimant, it can agree to stay its action pending the claimant's exhaustion of the administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.748" offset="13028764">Furthermore, a district court in appropriate circumstances could order such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.318" offset="13047050">In any event, the mere possibility that claims and counterclaims might be decided in different forums provides no reason for dispensing with the substantial benefits that flow to every claimant from the administrative claims process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.793" offset="13093025">Finally, Colt has discussed the careful balance between the bank statute, the National Bank Act, and the thrift statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.670" offset="13164496">I think it's important to point out that the states... the banks and thrifts operate under completely different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.074" offset="13190096">And in addition, it's important to point out that there is a centralized procedure in the banking context that does allow for... for determination of these claims; 12 U.S.C. 94 of the National Bank Act provides, in fact, that all claims must be filed... in a receivership must be filed in a particular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.322" offset="13271076">And that, in effect, solves the centralized... centralization problem that I've discussed so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.440" offset="13291556">Again, I think it's important... we cannot understate the importance... or we cannot overstate the importance of a centralized process resolving these thousands of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.247" offset="13330844">And, again, this situation is only likely to grow worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.116" offset="13342338">In short, the Bank Board's administrative claims process is a lawful and sensible first step in resolving creditor claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.203" offset="13370654">The Bank Board can justly require that claimants participate in this process before seeking a judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.674" offset="13392493">Any other result would severely cripple the Bank Board's ability to deal with the present savings and loan crisis, a crisis that is widely expected to grow only worse in the coming years.</text>
