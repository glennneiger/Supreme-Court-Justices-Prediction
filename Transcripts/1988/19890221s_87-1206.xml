            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86543">The second case is Mesa versus California number 87-1206 which comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.091" offset="134817">In the summer of 1985, the petitioners Mesa and Ebrahim were employed as mail truck drivers by the US Postal Service in Santa Clara County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.238" offset="179434">In unrelated incidence, the State of California issued complaints against the petitioners for criminal traffic violations that occurred while the petitioners were driving the mail trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.351" offset="223947">They were arraigned in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.851" offset="233874">Through the offices of the US attorney for the Northern District of California, the petitioners Sought to remove these prosecutions in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.202" offset="267310">The Federal District Court, pursuant to Section 1442(a) of the Judicial Code which permits removal of any similar criminal prosecution brought against a federal officer in State Court for any act done under color of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.625" offset="328959">The basis for the removal of petition was that the traffic violations had occurred while petitioners were on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.196" offset="355291">Federal District Court granted the removal of petitions, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a writ of mandamus ordering the District Court to remand the prosecutions to the California State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.808" offset="401684">On the ground that petitioners had failed to raise a colorable federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.547" offset="420701">We granted the petition to serve to resolve a conflict among the Circuits concerning the necessary predicate for federal officer removal under Section 1442.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.005" offset="466468">We now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.288" offset="483604">For reasons explained in the opinion, we decline to depart from a long line of this Court's precedents dating the 1868 that requires federal officer removal under the statute to be predicated upon the assertion of a federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.097" offset="546925">And this interpretation avoids potential difficulties under Article 3 of the constitution that might arise if we were to adopt petitioner's contrary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.004" offset="586527">Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
