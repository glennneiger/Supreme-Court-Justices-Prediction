            <text syncTime="13.224" offset="176869">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.610" offset="190348">This case presents the question whether the FSLIC, or FSLIC, as the receiver of an insolvent state-chartered savings and loan has access to Federal court to bring a damages action against directors and officers of the Institution for their violations of duties imposed by Federal as well as state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.939" offset="267670">Two jurisdictional statutes are involved: Section 1345 of Title 28 which provides generally for Federal agency jurisdiction in Federal court, and Section 1730(k)(1) of Title 22... of Title 12 which more specifically addresses jurisdiction in cases involving FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.885" offset="343530">The court of appeals held that there was no Federal jurisdiction over this case under either of those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.639" offset="366518">Mr. Taranto, do I understand that a new statute has been introduced that would abolish FSLIC?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="392013">Yes, a new bill has been introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="399537">It was introduced last Wednesday, the administration's comprehensive FSLIC bail-out bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.814" offset="427226">We sent a letter up to the Court on Friday that attempted to outline some of the provisions that would be... would be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.385" offset="453453">As of now, of course, the bill is merely proposed and--</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="85.070" offset="464216">Were it to be enacted, though, that would end this case, would it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="89.808" stopTime="420.673">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="89.808" offset="483128">--It... it may well end this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.843" offset="491279">The... the new bill would create a new transition entity that would take the place of FSLIC for all current receiverships and receiverships for the next three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.466" offset="533806">That new entity has a special jurisdictional provision which contains no exception to Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.321" offset="569228">We would believe that that would, in fact, solve the jurisdictional problem here, although there may be some argument about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.910" offset="603605">This case arose as a result of two dividends declared by Respondents as directors of the Manning Savings and Loan Association, a state-chartered thrift that was insured by FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.301" offset="649163">In 1980 Manning's directors declared a dividend of more than $400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.039" offset="668075">The dividend was doubly illegal and it was excessive by more than $300,000 because Manning had insufficient net worth and reserves under the FSLIC's regulations and, therefore, also under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.679" offset="722619">In late 1981 after FSLIC charged Manning... Manning's directors with having violated the Federal requirements, a cease and desist order was entered by a Federal court prohibiting Manning's directors from paying any dividends except in accordance with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.439" offset="781656">In April 1982, FSLIC issued new charges advising Manning's directors that Manning now had operating losses of roughly $300,000 per month and had a negative net worth of more than 2 million... of more than $500,000 which was more than $2 million short of the amount required to maintain its FSLIC insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.352" offset="861381">Despite those charges, Respondents as directors of Manning declared a dividend worth more than $300,000 the following month.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.125" offset="892415">That dividend, like the 1980 dividend, was illegal under both Federal and state law and was, therefore, also a violation of the Federal cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.147" offset="928568">In February 1983, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that Manning was insolvent and had incurred substantial dissipation of assets as a result of illegal and unsafe practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.805" offset="979141">The Board therefore placed Manning in receivership and appointed FSLIC to be the receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.776" offset="999099">In that capacity, FSLIC brought this suit against Respondents in May 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.161" offset="1020624">The complaint, among other things, sought damages under state law for Respondents' breach of their state law fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.600" offset="1054374">In support of the claim, FSLIC alleged that Respondents violated Federal obligations in several ways: by declaring dividends that were illegal under the Federal net worth and reserve requirements, by causing Manning to violate the Federal conflict of interest regulations, and by causing Manning to violate the cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.664" offset="1134622">Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.818" offset="1151236">The district court found that there was jurisdiction, but certified an interlocutory appeal on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.186" offset="1172657">The court of appeals reversed concluding that under Section 1730(k)(1) there was no Federal jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.208" offset="1204735">Section 1730(k)(1) has four parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.327" offset="1217274">The first, Clause (A), declares that FSLIC is an agency within the meaning of the definitional section of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.516" offset="1249979">The second part, Clause (B), sweepingly declares that all civil suits to which FSLIC is a party are deemed to arise under the laws of the United States and are within the district court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.341" offset="1301284">Clause (C) grants broad removal authority, but is not specifically at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.311" offset="1321241">Finally, there is the proviso which declares that any suit to which FSLIC is a party in its capacity as receiver of a FSLIC-insured state-chartered institution and</text>
            <text syncTime="309.499" offset="1361992">"which involves only the rights or obligations of investors, creditors, stockholders and such institution under state law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="323.092" offset="1416327">The court of appeals concluded that the proviso applied to this case and precluded Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.096" offset="1440359">First the court ruled that the proviso's requirement that the case involve</text>
            <text syncTime="333.448" offset="1457705">"only the rights or obligations of investors, creditors, stockholders and the institution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="338.769" offset="1479021">is satisfied whenever, as in this case, the only rights in the case are those of the falled thrift.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.856" offset="1503367">Second, the court ruled that a case involves</text>
            <text syncTime="348.291" offset="1517159">"only rights or obligations under state law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="351.743" offset="1530952">whenever, as is true here, the cause of action arises only under state law, even if Federal law questions are involved in determining if state law was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.234" offset="1576928">Since Manning was a state-chartered thrift and the claims at issue were brought by FSLIC in its capacity as receiver of Manning, the court of appeals held that the proviso applied and precluded the broad Federal question jurisdiction granted by Clause (B) of Section 1730(k)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="379.596" offset="1642338">The court further concluded that despite the declaration in Clause (A), that FSLIC is an agency for Title 28 purposes, the proviso must also preclude the Federal agency jurisdiction that would otherwise be available under 28 U.S.C. 1345.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.522" offset="1710048">In the court's view, the Section 1730(k)(1) proviso was designed to state an absolute limit on Federal jurisdiction under any jurisdiction granting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.263" offset="1756964">My argument today is that the court of appeals was incorrect in all three of its conclusions and that both Section 1730(k)(1)'s Clause (B) and Section 1345 furnish jurisdiction over this cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.475" offset="1825822">We have to win on... on only... only one of the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.195" offset="1840764">The... there is something of a difference in the relative importance for other cases of the... the various positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.134" offset="1876500">The... the... our first point about the limitation of the proviso to disputes among proviso parties is the one that has divided the courts of appeals, but the other issues are also important in other cases.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="451.609" offset="1930417">And your reliance on 1345 goes back through Subsection A of (k)(1).</text>

            <text syncTime="457.679" offset="1954658">We... we think that 1345 would apply even without Clause (A) of... of Section 1730(k)(1) because Clause (A) merely confirms what would be evident in any case; namely, that FSLIC, when acting as a receiver, is a Federal agency carrying out Federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.426" offset="2029682">And hence, for example, the very similar jurisdictional statute that applies to the FDIC, which contains no analogue to Clause (A), would reach... we would reach the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.615" offset="2074404">There would also be Section 1345 jurisdiction for the FDIC.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.808" offset="2131141">I can't tell you which covers a larger number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.112" offset="2148382">There is a very substantial overlap because most of the cases that involve non-proviso parties, directors, officers, debtors, are also cases that are brought by FSLIC and, hence, there would be jurisdiction under... under both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.705" offset="2210763">I'm not sure whether one of the classes of cases is... is actually larger than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.025" offset="2232079">It is a rare thing for FSLIC to sue one of the proviso parties, and that... that suggests that maybe the... our first argument about the limitation of the proviso to the named parties is... is a somewhat broader argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.175" offset="2632693">And the court of... under the court of appeals' view, Clause (A) would... would effectively be read out of the statute because if the proviso eliminates jurisdiction under 1345, as well as under Clause (B), then Clause (A) adds nothing whatever to the... to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.852" offset="2703328">The jurisdictional provisions at issue here reflect the important Federal programmatic interests that are at stake when FSLIC as receiver tries to recover from directors and officers whose violations of their legal obligations have led to the failure of thrifts all across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.929" offset="2767693">Congress provided for FSLIC to act as receiver of state thrifts precisely because of the important Federal interest at stake, and the present crisis in the FSLIC-insured thrift system starkly confirms Congress' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.754" offset="2818998">The ability to collect from directors and officers of failed thrifts, among others, directly affects the amount of money that the FSLIC fund can recover for its payouts in a particular receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.477" offset="2865809">It also may affect the health of the FSLIC insurance fund as a whole and, hence, the ability of FSLIC to handle other thrift failures and ultimately the U.S. Treasury if, as has happened, the fund proves inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.654" offset="2918577">In addition to the financial effect, recovering from directors and officers in particular serves the broader Federal interest in deterring future misconduct and future thrift failures.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.879" offset="2963507">In all of those ways, there is a strong Federal interest in... in FSLIC's ability to pursue claims in each receivership, and that is why Section 1730(k)(1) Clause (B) broadly declares that there is Federal jurisdiction whenever FSLIC is a party, and that is why Clause (A) confirms that FSLIC, like any other agency that is specifically authorized to sue, may bring its suits in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.760" offset="3066952">The proviso as an exception to those grants of jurisdiction should be read against this background.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.914" offset="3087641">And all three grounds for reversing the court of appeals reflect the important Federal interests at stake in suits like the present one.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.706" offset="3138737">Well, we think that... that it... it does not apply to Clause (A) because Clause (A) in confirming that FSLIC is an agency, confirms that Section 1345 of Title 28 grants jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.398" offset="3197564">That's a jurisdiction that does not depend at all on whether there's a Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.402" offset="3213551">And the proviso merely says in cases in which it applies, those cases shall not be deemed to arise under laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.475" offset="3245839">So, the proviso eliminates Federal question jurisdiction, but leaves any other basis of jurisdiction that would otherwise be available unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.045" offset="3276141">Section 1345 is just such a basis of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.716" offset="3302786">Our first argument concerning the non-proviso parties was that the court of appeals erred in concluding that this case, to quote the proviso,</text>
            <text syncTime="803.638" offset="3338521">"involves only the rights or obligations of investors, creditors, stockholders and the failed thrift. "</text>
            <text syncTime="973.683" offset="4018645">That is not so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.710" offset="3374779">This case involves, in addition to the rights of Manning, the failed thrift, also the obligations of directors and officers, and... and directors and officers are not among those listed in the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.754" offset="3422949">The proviso we think by its terms is properly construed not to apply unless the dispute is solely among parties listed in the proviso with FSLIC representing the failed thrift.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.727" offset="3470805">This construction is the only one that accounts for the decision by Congress to list particular parties as it did, listing those with claims against the receivership, as well as the... the failed thrift and omitting such persons as directors, officers and debtors who are commonly sued by a receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.821" offset="3539246">If the court of appeals were correct that the proviso applies whenever the only rights involved are those of the failed thrift, then the listing of investors, creditors and stockholders would be read out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.312" offset="3585221">The listing also undermines Respondents' view that the provision contemplates FSLIC's representing the interests of the named parties, for FSLIC as a receiver of a failed thrift always must represent the failed, thrift and the collective interests of its investors, creditors and stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.340" offset="3653349">The listing is simply given no effect in Respondents' view.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.542" offset="3666097">In addition, Respondents' suggestion invokes a wholly unrealistic picture of a unity of interests among the listed parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.148" offset="3696503">In fact, a very substantial number of suits involving FSLIC as receiver pit the obligations of the failed thrift against those of investors or creditors or stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.187" offset="3740702">And as we explained in our brief, it is entirely plausible that among all the persons who might be parties to a suit involving FSLIC as a receiver, Congress omitted the likely defendants in suits brought by the receiver and instead listed only those who have claims against the receivership estate, insiders who are more likely to initiate suit to recover from the estate than to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.802" offset="3835161">The process of dividing up the estate among claimants is traditionally centralized in the single forum having jurisdiction over the estate property, and where that forum was a state authority for state thrifts, the proviso was needed to make possible the continued centralizing of claims by insiders in that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.783" offset="3911125">By contrast, the process by which a receiver brings suit against outsiders to collect debts to the receivership estate is not traditionally centralized, and there was, therefore, no corresponding need to carve out an exception to the broad grant of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.577" offset="3982283">The second way we believe that the court of appeals erred was in concluding that this case</text>
            <text syncTime="969.779" offset="4003076">"involves only rights or obligations under state law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="976.199" offset="4028781">This case also involves the obligations of Respondents under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.687" offset="4046648">In particular, the complaint alleges a central support for the claimed breach of duty that Respondents violated their obligations under the Federal regulation requiring the maintenance of specified reserves and net worth under a Federal conflict of interest regulation and under the Federal cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.549" offset="4118119">The court of appeals was wrong because it read the proviso to apply whenever the cause of action arises under state laws, as the right to damages does in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.420" offset="4157617">But the proviso does not use that familiar term in referring to the rights or obligations that are involved in covered cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.110" offset="4184366">By contrast, Section 1730(k)(1) elsewhere twice uses the "arises under" language, once in the proviso itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.514" offset="4218012">The proviso does not apply where the case involves obligations under Federal law, as this one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.020" offset="4248000">That Congress granted Federal jurisdiction whenever questions under Federal law are involved in a case is fully in keeping with the policy reflected in the sweeping declaration of Clause (B), that all cases involving FSLIC are deemed to arise under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.362" offset="4309440">And it also is consistent with our first point, that the proviso was designed in claims against the receivership assets in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.151" offset="4344549">Such suits, unlike suits brought by FSLIC as receiver, often involve only state law questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.591" offset="4374328">Suits against directors and officers, by contrast, often involve Federal duties that are imposed in order to maintain a sound thrift system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.763" offset="4411004">The third way we believe the court of appeals erred was in ruling that the proviso ousts Federal courts of jurisdiction under Section 1345.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.785" offset="4447053">The language of the proviso will not support such a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.337" offset="4461264">The proviso simply declares that cases within its coverage</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.606" offset="4474325">"shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.074" offset="4488222">That language eliminates only arising under Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.728" offset="4510897">It leaves jurisdictional bases for no Federal question is necessary wholly unaffected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.716" offset="4534825">Section 1345 establishes one such basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.036" offset="4552066">A Federal agency may bring suit in Federal court regardless of whether its claim arises under Federal or state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.007" offset="4579964">The proviso, therefore, leaves Section 1345 jurisdiction unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.178" offset="4600653">There is no reason to depart from this plain reading of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.962" offset="4615804">To the contrary, as I have explained, reading the proviso to eliminate Federal agency jurisdiction, as well as Section 1730(k)(1)'s Clause (B) Federal question jurisdiction, would render Clause (A) redundant because Clause (A) and the Section 1345 jurisdiction... it confirms would then be... never be available unless Clause (B) jurisdiction were not also--</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.934" offset="5983680">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.969" offset="5995801">It is a matter of congressional intent that state courts in the first instance should decide an issue of state law and Federal courts in the first instance should decide an issue of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.325" offset="6029238">However, it's Petitioner's position in this case that due to the significance of their role as a Federal regulator, the volume of litigation and the spate of failures, for their own convenience, they seek a uniformity of decisions through the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.399" offset="6085558">The problem with following that policy lies in the fact that in this specific instance and in numerous others, the Federal court is bound by the state's highest court when it has considered that same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.856" offset="6127354">And in a case such as this where the state court has not ruled, the Federal court could rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.058" offset="6144177">That could be appealed to the Federal appellate court on up to this Court and then at that or any other time, the state court could rule contrary to the decision of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.181" offset="6180644">And you would, in fact, develop a dual body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.283" offset="6193078">I believe that this case and the construction of 1730(k)(1) can't properly be decided without some notion of the specifics involved and the general policy as determined by the Senate report on the Financial Institution Supervisory Act which states... and I quote... that</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.293" offset="6253159">"the general policy for the supervision and regulation of state savings and loans are primarily the states' affairs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.530" offset="6274057">The specific cases we are talking about here are collection cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.117" offset="6292448">When the FSLIC comes into state court as a receiver for a state savings and I can, the type of cases that flood the state courts are student I can defaults, can defaults, eviction notices, letters of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.508" offset="6341976">It's that huge volume of cases that the Congress I believe determined to keep out of Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.162" offset="6364546">And that's why they set up for the FDIC and the FSLIC a unified integrated scheme of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.966" offset="6391817">In that scheme the FDIC or the FSLIC, under either 12 U.S.C. 1819 Fourth or 12 U.S.C. 1730(k)(1), in its corporate capacity as the Federal insurer would go into Federal court, but as the receiver would take those cases which properly belong in state court to state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.110" offset="6464333">And quoting from the courts that have previously determined this, for example, FDIC v. Elefant, in referring to the legislative history, the courts noted that it was designed to prevent the fact of receivership from transferring wholesale to Federal court the money collection suits and related litigation in which a failed thrift will become embroiled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.183" offset="6600693">In 1966 there was pending in the Ninth Circuit the case of Acron v. FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.421" offset="6621590">Prior to 1966, the only way FSLIC could come into Federal court was if it was a Federal agency, and 13... and the district court in that case determined that FSLIC was a Federal agency, deemed it... there was a dispute as to the question of law... certified it to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.566" offset="6694211">And contrary to Petitioner's brief... and I believe I have it in the footnote at my last page of my brief... the fact is in... in March the Congress added to clarify that it, in fact, was a Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.239" offset="6736947">I believe that's the reason for it, and I don't believe the reason was to wipe out or read out of existence the proviso, merely to clarify that the FSLIC was an agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.171" offset="8084657">FSLIC is saying that the Respondents issued dividends in violation of the state Savings and Loan Act, which made no reference whatsoever to FSLIC requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.760" offset="8119034">And that's what the Seventh Circuit actually described as the cause of action in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.879" offset="8135439">The resolution of that issue is the resolution of the case regardless of other Federal causes of action that... that may arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.818" offset="8167204">All support the... the theory that it's a state savings and loan construction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.222" offset="8184862">That's a cause of action that must ultimately be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.757" offset="8202939">With respect to the subject of proviso parties, I would submit the Seventh Circuit was... made the proper decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.379" offset="8233450">In the case of FDIC v. Elefant, the FDIC informed the Seventh Circuit in that case that the presence of a non-proviso party would still deprive the Federal courts of Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.302" offset="8269186">That was their position in the Seventh Circuit as recently as 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.754" offset="8286949">Directors are those type of adverse parties that the FSLIC would naturally come into court to proceed against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.241" offset="8308892">And I would submit that when the FSLIC comes into court to enforce the rights of the institution and the resolution of those rights is the only question in the suit, then the suit involves only the rights or obligations of the institution regardless of who the defendants are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.250" offset="8364898">And interpreted in that fashion and interpreted with a policy basis to keep these many, many collection cases out of Federal court, the focus being brought by the receiver, both the FSLIC and the FDIC, serves that useful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.675" offset="8418606">Again, it keeps those case out of Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.212" offset="8432817">I would submit that the Financial Institution Supervisory Act which set out this jurisdictional scheme for both the FDIC and the FSLIC and a contrary ruling in today's case in the FSLIC would set up a separate scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.972" offset="8491853">The FDIC could go into state court, state causes of action on an identical case if it was the same cause of action for... for a bank as opposed to a savings and I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.827" offset="8527275">I would submit that that's not the provision... or not the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.481" offset="8561861">Finally, with respect to the agency argument, I would only point out that it was added, according to Congress, to clarify a reading or a construction of... of Section A that would read out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.205" offset="8608777">The proviso would not fulfill policy and, In fact, would say that all those cases that came into... or the FSLIC went into Federal court to resolve could then automatically go into... to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.465" offset="8657783">To give Federal courts indirectly what they couldn't have through the proviso I believe would be a... a fractured route to go.</text>
