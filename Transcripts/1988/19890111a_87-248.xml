            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138630">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-248, Georgia Brower v. The County of Inyo.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="174052">Mr. Gilmore, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_gene_gilmore" startTime="11.510" stopTime="152.801">
            <label>Mr. Robert Gene Gilmore</label>
            <text syncTime="11.510" offset="184606">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.781" offset="201742">This Court is once again called upon to determine the circumstances under which an individual who was seized will be deemed seized under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.607" offset="236955">It is the Petitioners' position in this case that the decedent, William Brower, was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when he was chased into a concealed police roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.883" offset="274153">The Ninth Circuit's decision to the contrary we believe is contrary in itself with this Court's prior precedents beginning with Terry v. Ohio on up through U.S. v. Mendenhall, and finally this past summer with Michigan v. Chesternut.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.144" offset="335175">Most significant in the Terry case we feel is the test set forth in a footnote, footnote number 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.279" offset="367672">Now, that footnote, although it is only a footnote, has been incorporated into the majority opinions in the Mendenhall, the INS v. Delgado, the Michigan v. Chesternut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.006" offset="414588">Therein the Court stated that it was not all conduct or all personal intercourse between a policeman and a citizen which will constitute a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.253" offset="459623">Only when the officer by means of physical force or a show of authority has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that there has been a seizure within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="502568">The test is very easy and straightforward to apply in a situation where the fleeing suspect decides to stop, submit to the authority and/or is physically and bodily restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.948" offset="546349">It is not so easy to apply in situations where the suspect does not submit to the authority or where the suspect, perhaps in a case similar to this, is not arrested or detained or restrained in the traditional sense of laying on of hands or handcuffing.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.069" offset="610819">In these latter situations, the Court has given guidance to us and has further refined the test set forth in Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.514" offset="644674">The Court did this in 1980 in the Mendenhall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.427" offset="656272">In the Mendenhall case, the Court held that a person was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when, in consideration of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would believe that they are not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.775" offset="709667">Although that majority opinion in Mendenhall was only joined in by two Justices, it was later adopted by the full majority in the INS v. Delgado case.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.135" offset="959084">Yes, I believe it would be, Justice Scalla, because the Court in the Mendenhall case has said that we look to the conduct of the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.360" offset="991998">And as the Court stated in Michigan v. Chesternut, this is an objective standard which allows us to measure the conduct from one police encounter to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.806" offset="1021778">Would the conduct of the police officers reasonably impart to the hostage taker that he was not free to leave... and certainly throwing up a, a number of officers around the hostage scene would tell him he's not free to leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.046" offset="1198783">What we need to do is, is further determine, before liability certainly can attach, as to whether it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.347" offset="1219995">Again, following Mendenhall to a reasonable and logical conclusion tells us that if the conduct of the police reasonably... reasonably... communicates to the suspect that he is not free with... free to leave, meaning in a broader sense that he has a, a freedom of liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.652" offset="9453164">I'd like to address, if I can, the last point that was raised on the Chesternut case and... and the issue of whether there has to be a certain communication by the law enforcement officers to the intended... or the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.191" offset="9503319">I believe... and I may be wrong, but I believe that the Court specifically indicated in that case that communicating or communication of an intent is... is important only to the extent that it may have actually been communicated, that the Court indicated that it was not a requirement that you somehow communicate the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.084" offset="9586911">I don't... I'm not sure how a case would ever be proved if we have to look to the subjective intent of every police officer making an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.339" offset="9611884">I think also on the issue of the case of Chesternut, it's important to understand that the Court was asked in that case to make a determination that a pursuit alone was a... a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.165" offset="9663188">The Court found that there was no seizure, but what's important is why the Court found no seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.291" offset="9691714">The Court found that there was no seizure not because there was a lack of bodily restraint or a submission to authority, but the Court, again following the Mendenhall test, looked to the conduct of the police officers and very simply said that these officers... what they did could not reasonably communicate to anyone that the individual was not free to walk away or disregard the show of authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.135" offset="9775097">But, counsel, Mendenhall says we adhere to the view that a person is seized only when, by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.761" offset="9825670">Now, it seems to me quite plausible to read that as saying that if the person does not choose to submit to the restraint, that the attempted seizure has not taken place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.851" offset="9878019">One interpretation of freedom of movement, restraint of freedom of movement, could be taken that we require bodily restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.526" offset="9912710">That's only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.618" offset="9917099">I think in light of the language that was quoted earlier from the Terry... and that's where that came... the Terry v. Ohio case, that we're speaking of something much, much broader than a simple freedom from bodily restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.924" offset="9958268">Freedom of movement should be read as a right of movement, not a simple bodily restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.088" offset="9982927">Also on the issue that was raised of the roadblock and whether it should be... there should be a finding or an allegation in the complaint of whether it was intentional or not, here again I think that there must be an distinction drawn between the intention in the sense that the officers did what they intended to do, as in this case pursuing and setting up a roadblock, versus an intention to kill this young man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.635" offset="10145095">I don't think that would be possible, but I do not believe in... in utilizing or looking to the requirement of intent that this Court would require such a showing under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.382" offset="10188145">Certainly, again, under the Daniels case, et cetera, we know that negligence is not enough with respect to a Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.457" offset="10212387">But I'm not sure that this Court, when we're looking to the arbitrary conduct of a police officer... and that's what we're trying to restrict... that this Court would require intentional in the sense that they intended to kill the young man, only that they intended their conduct, setting up the roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.964" offset="10266408">There is the question that was raised as to whether deadly force was... was an issue on seizure, and I think the general consensus was, no, that's something that should be left for the issue of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.601" offset="10313010">And not to work against myself, but I don't feel that that's necessarily correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.825" offset="10329833">The Court in the Michigan v. Tennessee case indicated that what we are doing is measuring and gauging the coercive conduct of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.581" offset="10364942">And we're not doing that to determine whether the conduct itself was somehow inherently offensive or heinous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.016" offset="10390646">What we're doing is looking to the conduct to see if it rises out of the normal social conduct which Terry tells us is okay, is not a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.360" offset="10428054">Is it sufficiently coercive in the sense that it is now elevated out of that circumstance and into a seizure?</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.585" offset="10452922">I think it's important in that sense that the Ninth Circuit did find on the same factual situation again that the conduct here was intentional, unjustified, brutal and offensive to human dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.767" offset="10525647">Certainly if that was the case... if that's what these facts tell us, then I think that this certainly is coercive to the extent that it raises and arises beyond mere social conduct by the police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.984" offset="10570473">Mr. Gilmore, why shouldn't we adopt a constitutional rule that encourages people to abide by police directives?</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.693" offset="10629301">If those directives turn out to be unreasonable, then they have a constitutional cause of action against the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.599" offset="10660961">But why should we adopt a rule that says go ahead, run, flee down the highway?</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.253" offset="10679561">And even if you do that and endanger public lives, you will still have a constitutional cause of action against the police officers if it turns out that their chase is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.079" offset="10714878">In other words, why shouldn't we adopt the rule that you have to stop?</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.051" offset="10726790">And if... if they've been wrong in stopping you, then you have a cause of action, but if you don't listen to them and endanger the public, you don't have a constitutional cause of action?</text>
