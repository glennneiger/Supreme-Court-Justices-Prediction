            <text syncTime="517.979" offset="2207703">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="520.765" offset="2218883">The central difficulty with the court of appeals decision in this case is that it eviscerates both the clear and convincing evidence standard and the rule of independent review set forth in New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.471" offset="2261724">It does so by requiring reviewing courts to defer to all conceivable inferences supporting the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.893" offset="2291399">Under the court of appeals analysis, a reviewing court is required to do that even it other inferences, in its own view, are more reasonable or more justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.583" offset="2326194">The court of appeals has, therefore, erected a presumption of actual malice in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.468" offset="2345734">It has mandated to finding the cumulated inferences that a reviewing court is required to find will add up to clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.223" offset="2376767">And it has rendered the Constitutional obligation of independent review a mirage.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.127" offset="2396307">Independent review is not independent if a reviewing court is required to defer to all findings of fact a jury could have made and then draw all conceivable inferences from those findings in favor of the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.666" offset="2442491">Independent review does not encompass the entire record if, as the court of appeals held, a reviewing court is required to ignore all evidence favoring the defendant, even undisputed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.358" offset="2485228">An independent review is not review at all, not in any meaningful sense, if a reviewing court is required to defer to an array of hypothetical subsidiary facts that a jury could have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.348" offset="2529218">So viewed, the very process of judgment the Rule of Independent Review presupposes disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.269" offset="2552937">In fact, it predetermines the result and it eliminates the process of judgment entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.806" offset="4479102">Yet, the court of appeals' decision effectively requires a reviewing court to draw an inference of actual malice from such testimony in every case in which a jury is found in favor of a political candidate and against a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.198" offset="4528630">In such cases, the newspaper literally starts out with three strikes against it because it will always compete with some other media, it will virtually always endorse candidates for public office, and it will always be subject to second-guessing when the scope of its investigation... not whether it investigated at all... judged by 20/20 hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.925" offset="4599579">But the issue in this case is not the abstract relevance of these categories of circumstantial evidence to the actual malice inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.814" offset="4727056">To do that, a court must review the entire record, including undisputed evidence favoring the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.549" offset="4750044">To do that, a reviewing court must draw its own inferences from the record evidence and not defer to an array of hypothetical subsidiary facts that a jury could have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.054" offset="4784003">This Court has been making such determinations and exercising such independent review in First Amendment cases since at least its 1927 decision in Fiske v. Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.356" offset="6021267">Let me speak first to the issue of whether it was proper for any court, the jury, the trial court, or this Court, to consider whether the motive of a newspaper is one of the kinds of circumstantial evidence that bear upon the question of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.067" offset="6092111">That's all we've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.300" offset="6097022">And this Court indicated that in Butts and the panel majority in Tavoulareas also reemphasized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.488" offset="6125757">All we say about the motive to compete against the Enquirer and to protect the incumbent judge, that it is a kind of circumstantial evidence which, combined with all the circumstantial evidence in the record and the direct evidence of actual malice, adds up to... enough to constitute clear and... excuse me... clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.539" offset="6221992">Now, let me next talk about that line of cases that my colleague believes justifies a kind of independent review that he would have appellate courts engage in in public figure libel cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.657" offset="6350410">All of those cases involve objective questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.543" offset="6369949">Whereas in here, in this case, the question is... the question is what was in the mind of the publisher of the matter when he decided to put it in circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.582" offset="6414148">A purely subjective question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.867" offset="6423343">Beyond that, those questions, those cases that he would invoke in support of his position, involve only the ultimate question, not... in none of those cases did the Court say that exhaustive independent review by appellate courts of the record was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.001" offset="6523863">And so that we're dealing with different kind of animals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.280" offset="6700973">But if you're asking whether... given what the record shows the newspaper knew at the time, whether that constitutes reckless disregard, that's certain... it's arguably an objective inquiry, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.421" offset="6861469">So that there is a relationship between an objective standard, which is applicable if the record permits it, and the kind of subjective determination which the jury had to make in order to make a finding of actual malice under... under the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.618" offset="7258321">And after... after having known that Alice Thompson was a lady with a psychiatric history, a criminal record, a motive to lie, and other... and other basis to believe she was undesirable, the decisionmakers consciously avoided talking to Patsy Stephens, who could have corroborated what this lady said, the consciously avoided listening to the tapes of that meeting that was held at Connaughton's house which brought along, asked for... which Connaughton said,</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.991" offset="7503768">That's not negligence, if this Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.777" offset="7514948">That's what distinguishes this from New York Times and from St. Amant, because by any test or under any standard I would have brought this case... and I believe that a properly instructed jury hearing this evidence would have found that actual malice was proved by clear and convincing evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.153" offset="9800454">The rule exists, but it exists as honored in a breach 25 years after New York Times was announced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.870" offset="10019255">First, in response to Justice Stephens' question of Mr. Lloyd, it is indisputably true and one of those undisputed facts in this record that a reviewing court should credit that this... the tape recordings of which Mr. Lloyd refers run two hours and 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.547" offset="10074008">By the shortest estimate of any of the participants in that all-night meeting, that meeting lasted four hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.450" offset="10097623">That means that there is, by my count, an hour and 40 minutes that is unaccounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.918" offset="10115490">So, listening to the tapes, in my view, is an incredible red herring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.156" offset="10136493">The tape that ought to be listened to, Your Honors, is the tape of the interview that the Journal News conducted with Dan Connaughton, the one that Justice Stevens was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.412" offset="10169512">There is a complete transcript of that tape-recorded interview in the Joint Appendix.</text>
