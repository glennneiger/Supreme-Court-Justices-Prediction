            <label>Ms. Patti Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.188" offset="200537">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.032" offset="255917">This appeal arises from a judgment that a statute of Congress is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.387" offset="285383">Since the district court entered judgment, several events have taken place which have substantially altered the nature of this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.224" offset="316730">In order to place those developments in proper perspective, I want to begin by first discussing the statute, then the district court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.015" offset="355809">And, finally, the recent developments and the effect that they have on this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.384" offset="373363">The law at issue in this case, Section 630, is a response to the use of nondisclosure agreements to impose certain new obligations on federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="417876">In 1983 President Reagan directed that all federal employees who have access to classified information must sign nondisclosure agreements or risk lose... losing their security clearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.832" offset="467091">Two provisions in these nondisclosure agreements became particularly troubling to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.153" offset="492377">The first is that the agreements obligated employees not to disclose classifiable information as well as classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="531352">While employees would know what classified information is, Congress was concerned that the term "classifiable" was so vague employees wouldn't know what their obligations were under the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.417" offset="573461">The second aspect of the forms that concerned Congress was the prior authorization requirement which the appellees applied to disclosures to members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.957" offset="615571">And here Congress was concerned that it may lose access to information that it needs to carry out its legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.361" offset="645246">Congress entered into negotiations with the Executive Branch in an attempt to resolve this controversy, but those negotiations were not satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.051" offset="684012">Accordingly, Congress passed this law, Section 630, which prohibits the use of funds to require employees to sign the two forms that had been used, as well as any other nondisclosure agreements that contain certain of the same provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.679" offset="750467">And there are two categories of provisions that were banned in Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.499" offset="769798">The first provisions, the first bans, go to the information that's covered by the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.086" offset="796129">Congress' concern was that employees should know what their obligations are under the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.557" offset="818072">So Congress did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.557" offset="826013">It banned the use of the term classifiable and it specified what unmarked information can be covered by the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.763" offset="858823">If information is not marked, then the employee must know that the information is either classified or in the process of a classification determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.471" offset="901664">And this provision was a response to the standards that had been offered by Appellee Garfinkel both in hearings before Congress and in several Federal Register notices that attempt to define what this term classifiable meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.480" offset="961745">In those definitions offered by Appellee Garfinkel, he stated that employees would be liable if they know or reasonably should know that information is classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.788" offset="1006989">Congress rejected this 630 that the employee must know that unmarked information is covered by the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.179" offset="1052547">The second set--</text>

            <text syncTime="227.313" offset="1061011">When you say unmarked, that's material that has not already been classified?</text>

            <text syncTime="231.250" offset="1076789">--Generally, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.951" offset="1087551">Both in the Executive Order and in the directives that have been issued by Appellee Garfinkel and other agencies, classified information must be marked.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.307" offset="1125063">In some instances, marking takes a different form.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.176" offset="1140527">For example, with oral communications and recordings, instead of a clear marking, there would be a statement that the information is classified and anything should be marked that comes out of that communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.637" offset="1218372">It is moot as to all of the employees who received notice that the term classifiable has been deleted from the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.958" offset="1243659">And everyone agrees that it is moot as to those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.445" offset="1257556">There is a dispute, though, as to the proper remedy in that instance and also the extent as to which the mootness permeates the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.766" offset="1290888">The Appellees contend that this Court should affirm the district court judgment on grounds of mootness, and we believe that is an inappropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.454" offset="1325579">But the part of the case that is moot should be vacated as moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.493" offset="1353791">I mean, there was... Garfinkel put a notice in the Federal Register modifying the existing forms.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.336" offset="1621181">Instead, we ask the Court to vacate the district court judgment and remand this case for the district court to sort out all the recent developments that have taken place and the effect that they have on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.560" offset="1666007">In addition, because the district court decided the constitutional questions before deciding the statutory ones fully, we ask this Court to give the district court instructions to follow the correct order on the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.522" offset="1733925">What we ask the Court to do is instruct the district court that it should first decide the extent to which this case is still a live controversy and then the extent to which there are violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.458" offset="5241647">In challenging the statute below, the only evidence that the Appellees introduced was an affidavit by Appellee Webster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.148" offset="5276338">And that affidavit makes two assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.516" offset="5289817">The first is that disclosures of classified intelligence information may harm national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.253" offset="5316776">And the second is nondisclosure agreements may assist the Executive Branch in preventing those disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.942" offset="5343525">We have no dispute with either of those propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.061" offset="5360034">But they don't shed any light on the particular provisions of Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.548" offset="5381977">In fact, that affidavit says nothing about a knowledge standard, a prior authorization requirement for Congressional disclosures, or the term classifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.587" offset="5422101">The district court didn't rely on any evidence, that evidence or any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.427" offset="5449478">He decided that the President has exclusive authority over national security information and that Congress has no role to play in regulating disclosure of national security information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.984" offset="5499737">In fact, the focus in the district court was on the term classifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.888" offset="5519381">And the same district judge who decided this case declared that term unconstitutionally vague two months after he issued this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.827" offset="5555117">He enjoined the use of this term, although he decided Congress has no power to do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.398" offset="5581344">The first error, therefore, in the district court decision is the assumption that Congress has no power in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.302" offset="5613004">And once it's recognized that Congress has numerous powers under the Constitution, such as the lawmaking power, the appropriations power, the power to regulate the land and naval forces, et cetera, then it becomes clear this is an area of shared powers and the proper test is the one set forth in Nixon v. GSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.167" offset="5696492">In that case, this Court said that the party challenging a statute, or the branch challenging a statute, must show that it impairs their ability to carry out their constitutional functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.641" offset="5750408">Here the Executive Branch has not made any showing that it is impaired by the terms in Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.414" offset="5781442">The only evidence was the Webster affidavit that didn't go to the particular terms in Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.584" offset="5806101">And it's unlikely that the Executive Branch could make such a showing, given the nature of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.766" offset="7554843">Now, in our view that is certainly valid because, for example, the Appellants would argue that their members have a First Amendment right to petition Congress through divulging classified information without going through channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.974" offset="7599669">Our position is that the First Amendment does not confer any such right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.167" offset="7856505">The President has control, as this Court said in Egan last term, over classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.702" offset="7878552">The instrument of his exercise of control over that is the Executive Order 12356, and each of the Agencies that administers classified information has rather specific instructions and guidelines that they furnish to employees to tell them what their obligations are.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.573" offset="12414036">If the Court should conclude that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the forms on their fact and the statute, and that the statute has to be read to tie the Executive's hands in disciplining or taking other action against somebody who makes a negligent disclosure of something he should know is classified, then we do believe the statute would be unconstitutional for the reasons that were alluded to by several members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.406" offset="12525422">There are a number of reasons why we think this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.060" offset="12552067">Perhaps the most explicit comes from Article II of the Constitution itself, which obligates the President to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.518" offset="12589892">And care suggests caution, and in the area of national security information it suggests the utmost caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.339" offset="12617164">And that obligation of care is properly passed on to the persons who assist the President of the United States in foreign relations and national security matters and entitle him to insist that the lower-ranking employees who have access to national security information have to exercise the utmost care.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.660" offset="12746418">What I'm saying is that the President has an obligation to be circumspect... has an obligation that fits... that fits the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.368" offset="12797305">And when we're talking about the subject matter of national security information, he has an obligation to exercise the care and to see that his subordinates have exercised the care that is appropriate to the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.092" offset="12840145">And, as I say, in Snepp, the Court recognized that an intelligence agent's position was one of high trust and fiduciary obligation by virtue of his assuming that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.983" offset="12887688">And as an aspect of that, such an employee is briefed as to what his obligations are, and someone who is experienced in operating in this field is not going to be at sea in determining what information he can disclose and what he can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.458" offset="12941605">And we think that it would greatly disrupt the constitutional structure for Congress to be in a position to tell the President that he cannot take action against someone who carelessly discloses information that is in... in fact touches on the national security and does so without ever checking with the appropriate authorities in the government to see whether the information is in fact subject to being protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.691" offset="13038572">In fact, that was the theme of the Snepp decision, which was that an employee properly should err on the side of caution and check with the agency where he was employed before he discloses the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.064" offset="13084025">And we think that that is exactly what the Constitution requires itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.070" offset="13116103">And although this case can do disposed of on statutory grounds, we would urge the Court to bear clearly in mind the substantial Constitutional problems that would be raised with both... with respect to both paragraphs 3 and 4 of this statute, and paragraph 1, if the statute were allowed to be applied in a way that would disrupt the President's control over national security information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.172" offset="13232505">Let me say, too, that the... that the... going back on the question of furnishing information to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.112" offset="13264269">We're not suggesting that the President or the Director of Central Intelligence, or other officials, are going to lightly withhold information from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.349" offset="13293213">Our point is that it's a question of cooperation between the branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.384" offset="13305334">And 50 USC 413, which we've cited in the brief, which provides for the Director to share information with the Intelligence Committees is exactly the sort of cooperative arrangement through official channels, with decisions being made by the appropriate officials in the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.477" offset="13365729">That's... that's exactly the way we think things should operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.762" offset="13378790">In fact, the Constitution itself suggests exactly that arrangement because it assigns to the President that responsibility to furnish information to Congress concerning the state of the union, which would necessarily include classified information within the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.272" offset="13428841">It assigns that power to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.172" offset="13436469">Now, when you have other... other functions assigned to other agencies of the government, by statute maybe different questions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.443" offset="13461546">But there the subject matter is one that is vested in the President directly by virtue of the Constitution itself, as Commander-in-Chief, as the sole organ of the nation in foreign affairs, then the President has to... has to have unimpeded control over the information within the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.470" offset="13525703">And that's what we think this case is ultimately about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.022" offset="13539914">Just as the Commander-in-Chief has to be able to command people, subordinates, in the Executive Branch, so too does the head of the Executive Branch in the area of national affairs have to have that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.480" offset="13589755">And control over national security information in the Executive Branch is merely one subset or one part of the President's overall responsibility for the conduct of the national security within the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.622" offset="13634268">That's something quite different from the power of Congress addressing something to the President to request information or to command that the President perform certain substantive duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.728" offset="13674705">But in terms of the responsibility for keeping his own house in order and for the performance of the jobs by his own subordinates in whom he has to trust... have the utmost trust, then we think that Congress cannot disrupt the arrangement that the Constitution assigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.789" offset="13742937">And the First Congress recognized this by--</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.641" offset="13754327">But, Mr. Kneedler, I just can't... I can't avoid interrupting you with this thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.593" offset="13770209">The Constitution also gives Congress the power to provide for a navy and for the armed forces, and so forth, and often classified information is highly relevant to their task.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.615" offset="13806258">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.015" offset="13807825">And... and the arrangements that have been worked out between the branches are that the Executive Branch shares through proper channels an enormous amount of classified information.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3422.571" offset="13842098">But, of course, the constitutional question is suppose the Executive decides not to share some information that Congress thinks it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.875" offset="13859339">That's... that's what we--</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3427.959" offset="13863623">Well, and the Congress has the power of the purse ultimately by saying, if you want an Army, you'd better furnish the information that enables us to consider that question intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.266" offset="13908867">And that is exactly the way the framers of the Constitution contemplated that questions concerning the national security would be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.538" offset="13941990">By cooperation between the branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.305" offset="13948991">And our concern with this statute, at least the impulse behind it, is that it... it seems as an effort to sweep aside all of the controls within the Executive Branch and the deliberate procedures for sharing information and, instead, to radically change past practices and allow employees to take matters into their own hands.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patti Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3471.320" offset="14037076">I think it would be useful if I explained what we challenged and what's relevant now in this issue of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.426" offset="14077514">We challenged the Executive Branch's noncompliance with Section 630 because the Executive Branch required employees to sign the forms listed in Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.132" offset="14116279">At least 49,000 of those forms were signed during the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.603" offset="14134252">The Executive Branch is arguing now that it is complying with Section 630, and the question is what's happened with those 49,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.840" offset="14163195">How have those forms been brought into compliance, either through the Notice or by having those employees sign the new forms?</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.827" offset="14187123">And that is why the subsections of Section 630 are now essential for the government's compliance argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.849" offset="14215231">There is no longer a violation only if those forms comply with all of the provisions of Section 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.503" offset="14245847">I want to close with just one observation, and that is the effect that this judgment has had on the cooperation that Mr. Kneedler says is so essential between the branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.411" offset="14293389">The district judge, by declaring that the Executive branch has such sweeping power, has impeded the kind of accommodation that should take place in this kind of a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.636" offset="14338320">And we hope that if this Court wipes that decision off the books, that... that the accommodation would follow.</text>
