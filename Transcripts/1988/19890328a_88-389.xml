            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="17.443" offset="156258">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.562" offset="168796">This case presents the following issue: Must age-based distinctions in benefits offered through a bona fide employee benefit plan be justified by age-related cost considerations?</text>
            <text syncTime="32.185" offset="215294">The Sixth Circuit answered that question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.506" offset="228565">The Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio, however, disputes that holding and believes that an age-related cost justification is inconsistent with the plain language of the Age Discrimination and Employment Act and, moreover, is inconsistent with the purposes of the ADEA, and in particular, Section 4(f)(2) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.170" offset="315187">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.753" offset="321561">The Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio, which I will refer to as PERS, was created by the Ohio General Assembly in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.508" offset="356565">It provides retirement benefits to Ohio public employee; on the municipal, county and state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.298" offset="383732">There are two types of retirement benefits available: age and service retirements benefits and disability retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.385" offset="412049">There are three ways to qualify for age and service retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.206" offset="431379">A member of PERS may be... must have at least five years of service credit, have attained the age of 60; or must have at least 25 years of service credit and be at least 55 years of age; or must have 30 years of service credit, irrespective of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.782" offset="493655">In order to qualify for disability retirement benefits, a member of PERS must have at least five years of service credit, have not attained the age of 60, and be, or presume to be, permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.839" offset="545900">June Betts... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.808" offset="553737">The actuarial assumptions that underlie both the disability retirement benefits and the age and service retirement benefits are intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.397" offset="588114">And all benefits, whether they be age and service or disability retirement benefits, are derived from a common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.635" offset="617058">June Betts, the appellee, was hired by the Hamilton County Board of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities at the age of 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.657" offset="649136">At the age of 61 she became disabled because of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.477" offset="668467">She submitted applications both for disability retirement benefits and age and service retirement benefits to PERS.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.548" offset="696679">She requested that her age and service retirement application not be processed unless her disability retirement application could not be processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.337" offset="731892">June Betts was more interested in the disability retirement benefits because they would have afforded her a higher monthly pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.158" offset="759164">Because Ohio law contains an age 6O cutoff for eligibility to apply for disability retirement benefits, PERS could not process her disability retirement application.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.199" offset="799288">They did, however, process and approve her age and service application.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.818" offset="813812">She is currently receiving a monthly pension, as well as full health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.602" offset="828963">June Betts initiated suit claiming that the age 60 cutoff under Ohio law for eligibility to apply for disability retirement benefits constituted a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.677" offset="877237">PERS defended on the basis that its plan was protected under Section 4(f)(2) of the Act, which provides that it will not be illegal for an employer to observe the terms of any bona fide employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act, provided no such plan permits or requires involuntary retirement because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.978" offset="978383">The District Court granted June Betts' motion for summary judgment on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.631" offset="997087">First, the court held that PERS was not the type of plan contemplated under 4(f)(2) because the age 60 cutoff could not be justified by age-related cost considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.737" offset="1041495">Secondly, the District Court found that the unavailability of disability retirement benefits to June Betts was the equivalent of constructive discharge and involuntary retirement because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.497" offset="1092486">A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the basis that the age 60 cutoff under PERS could not be justified by an age-related cost consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.786" offset="1133655">It did not, however, reach the constructive discharge or the involuntary retirement question.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.423" offset="1156225">Now, PERS asserts that the Sixth Circuit was incorrect in its holding that 4(f)(2) requires a showing of age-related cost for three reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.712" offset="3545384">One of the problems with the age-related cost justification is it takes a test that requires an inquiry into the motivation of the employer, and requires the employer to satisfy an objective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.437" offset="3596271">If you can't demonstrate age-related cost justification, then ipso facto, you are a subterfuge, no matter what the intent of the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.258" offset="3731585">For instance, if the plan made it difficult for an employer... an older worker to be hired, or if it made it difficult for an older worker to advance within the employ of that particular company, specifically because of that person's age.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.620" offset="3796996">Or if they tried to use the plan to reduce the wages or salaries of older workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.440" offset="3824267">That would mean it was a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.059" offset="3838792">I think a good example might be in the Karlen case out of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.379" offset="3860003">Now, that court did find an age... old rely on an age-related cost justification, but they found that the plan itself was bona fide; they just found that the plan may have been conceived with the purpose of forcing older workers from the job market.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.364" offset="4075983">It reversed this Court in respect to its holding that involuntary retirement, based on age, was legal within the 4(f)(2) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.286" offset="4107644">But the language passed by Congress says specifically that it... it addresses itself exclusively to the issue of involuntary retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.142" offset="4143066">There is nothing in the language of the '78 amendment to suggest that Congress was addressing anything other than the McMann position on involuntary retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.080" offset="4182876">Now, the appellee may point to some language in the legislative history, but, first, that legislative history I think does as much to confirm that what Congress was concerned about was the issue of involuntary retirement and admonishing the courts that, whether that involuntary retirement provision came in before or after the passage of the ADEA made no difference; there was going to be complete restriction in respect to involuntary retirement on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.101" offset="4298965">But, because the... the amendment in 1978 dealt only with the issue of involuntary retirement, any remarks in the legislative history involving what that '67 amendment meant, or what the '67 Act meant, is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.478" offset="4368450">You can't look to an older Congress... or this Court has not looked to a Congress 10 years later to define the meaning of legislation passed in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.715" offset="4401365">Moreover, in their... in the appellee's brief and the amicus brief, they now contend that the 1967 Act had more than one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.773" offset="4449639">In effect, they are saying there were at least two purposes underlying the 4(f)(2) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.360" offset="4467925">Well, the remarks in the '78 legislative history that they refer to say... mention only age-related costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.449" offset="4500316">It seems to me inherent in that position is that the people... the Congress in '78, even they were misconstruing the scope of a 4(f)(2) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.221" offset="4539396">Now, I think as the Court is aware, that there are two portions that the courts below try to plug this age-related cost consideration in: the such as language and the subterfuge language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.112" offset="4586939">Now, I have discussed at some length why it shouldn't fit in the subterfuge language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.997" offset="4602507">I would like to address why it can't fit into the such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.384" offset="4628003">The basic reason is that age-related cost is not the common thread that binds pension, retirement and insurance plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.823" offset="4657783">In 1967 when the ADEA was promulgated, and even today, there are plans such as PERS' plans, such as defined contribution pension plans, or a profit sharing pension plan that cannot reflect age-related costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.250" offset="4723507">And when Congress passed this legislation, these were common types of retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.820" offset="4745763">They could have limited the scope of this exemption if they wanted to, but they picked very broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.741" offset="4773453">They said, any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension and insurance plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.711" offset="4797381">But that was to emphasize the point that employers could not discriminate in respect to salary or wages or incidentals associated to coming to work and putting in a day's work for a day's pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.554" offset="4852761">So, the common thread between retirement, pension and insurance plans, however, is the fact that, they do provide compensation of a kind outside of wages and salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.212" offset="4903334">Moreover, common sorts of aspects, or benefits within a particular plan... for instance, in a defined benefit plan, there is no age-related cost justification for a set off for Social Security; there is no increase for an employer to provide benefits just because the Social Security is also providing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.060" offset="4990792">But that sort of provision would be illegal because it can't be justified by an age-related cost consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.250" offset="5023497">Now, I think I have touched at length the fact that the language doesn't support the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.487" offset="5048470">I... I'd like to point out that... and reinforce that at the time that Congress passed this legislation, and even today, there is a fairly common understanding of what an employee benefit plan is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.962" offset="5102387">In fact, it's remarkable how legislation throughout the years has reflected a similarity in what industry, what Congress recognizes as an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.102" offset="5146899">And so these sorts of plans, just like PERS, was no stranger to Congress at the time they passed the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.827" offset="5193815">And I'd also like to point out that, in Justice White's concurrence in United Airlines v. McMann, Justice White enunciated the very same policy that we are enunciating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.301" offset="5243761">I think it's also consistent--</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.538" offset="5276676">I think also that the McMann majority inherently reflected that position when they said explicitly that a pre-existing plan didn't have to show an age-related cost justification because it didn't have to show a business or economic purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.948" offset="5338325">And the Court concludes, and whether one wants to consider it dicta or not, a majority of this bench still concluded that opinion by saying without qualification that an economic or business purpose is not necessary to demonstrate that the employer falls within the perimeters of the Section 4(f)(2) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.195" offset="5415334">Now, much of the Appellee's case rests on this Court taking legislative history and trying to cram it in someplace to the 4(f)(2) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.686" offset="5469250">And they... they contend that it's very clear in the 1967 legislative history that all Congress was talking about was age-related costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.226" offset="5507389">Well, one of the most principal pieces of legislative history in regard to the ADEA is the Secretary of Labor's report, that this Court noted in EEOC v. Wyoming, provided a great deal of guidance to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.618" offset="5557022">And the Secretary of Labor provided more than just cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.670" offset="5573218">In fact, the Secretary of Labor noted that that wasn't the principal hindrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.240" offset="5595474">What the legislative history demonstrates is that 4(f)(2) was a vital compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.413" offset="5624209">It represented a vital piece of the package in order to get the Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.817" offset="5653779">Congress wanted to insure that older workers would be hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.137" offset="5671020">They wanted to promote that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.837" offset="5673841">That was the consuming purpose of the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.605" offset="5684917">And the consuming purpose of the 4(f)(2) exemption was to protect employee benefit plans, which might serve as hindrances to the hiring of older workers, was to protect them from disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.778" offset="5729639">And the Age Discrimination... the age-related cost justification certainly does disrupt bona fide plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.067" offset="5758792">I would direct the Court towards the amicus brief submitted by the State of Pennsylvania, pages 29 and 30, in which Pennsylvania notes that at least 10 other states denied disability retirement benefits to people who are eligible for age and service retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.513" offset="5824516">And they make reference to 25 other states that have plans that have some sort of distinction based on age in respect to disability retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.516" offset="5856594">I would also direct the Court to the amicus brief submitted by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, and direct the Court to page 24, where they indicate that the majority of retirement plans, just like the plan at issue here, apparently limit eligibility for disability benefits to those younger employees who are ineligible for regular early retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.984" offset="5954396">So, if Congress was trying to avoid the disruption of these employee benefit plans in order to insure that employers would hire older workers, then the age-related cost considerations does an injustice to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.259" offset="6019598">The last point that I would like to make, moving on from the legislative history, is that the amicus, the EEOC, in the person of the Solicitor General's office, will argue to this Court that they should adopt the age-related cost considerations... consideration because it's reflective of consistent agency policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.907" offset="6098174">Well, I... and agency interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.525" offset="6108623">I would just like to make note for the Court that when this legislation was first... when the EEOC or the Department of Labor regulations were first published in 1969, they initially had one safe harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.182" offset="6163272">Then later in '69, they created two safe harbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.301" offset="6175706">When the EEOC republished and revamped the regulations involving Section 4(f)(2), they went back to one purpose and one way to satisfy the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.426" offset="6216248">And now, again, in this appeal, for the first time in this litigation, they argue that there were really two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.913" offset="6242161">Well, I don't see that sort of flip-flop as being consistent agency interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.298" offset="6259716">If anything, it indicates that the agency has been inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.102" offset="6274971">And unless the Court has any further questions, I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.080" offset="6346860">When June Betts was disabled at age 61, she was denied disability benefits by PERS solely because of her age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.169" offset="6383223">And she was then forced to retire... to apply for regular retirement rather than disability retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.590" offset="6408823">But for the PERS age 60 rule in the person... in the PERS plan, June Betts would have received $355 under disability benefits instead of the $158.50 per month that she received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.667" offset="6469218">Now, it's undisputed that the PERS plan discriminates on the basis of age and would be in violation of the Act unless it is eligible for the 4(f)(2) exemption to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.890" offset="6518119">PERS has two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.926" offset="6526165">The first of these arguments is that all pre-1967 plans are exempt in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.698" offset="6557303">The second of these issues is that there is no requirement that employee benefit plans that discriminate on the basis of age must be justified by cost considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.138" offset="6603069">I will focus primarily on the first issue, and Mr. Wright, on behalf of the United States will be focusing and addressing the second issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.059" offset="11118700">Both the Department of Labor, which administered the Act until 1979, and the EEOC, which has administered it since, have agreed that Section 4(f)(2) is not the wide-open authorization to discriminate that Ohio contends it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.938" offset="11186305">Rather, the agencies have agreed that the statute requires employees to justify discrimination, usually by showing that it costs more to provide benefits to older employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.796" offset="11337711">But, let me add that it has always been clear that it extends beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.700" offset="11361325">If I may digress briefly into the legislative history to answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.271" offset="11383582">The 1967 legislative history, and let me make clear that it was in 1967, not 1978 that I'm talking about, there were clearly two problems on Congress' mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.011" offset="11434573">One was benefits such as term life insurance, which do cost more to provide older employees than younger employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.015" offset="11466547">Congress wanted to allow employers to spend the same amount on older employees, even though they would be discriminated against in that they would receive a lesser benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.306" offset="11511686">Also on Congress' mind, as is made clear by the colloquy between Senator Javits, who drafted section 4(f)(2), and Senator Yarborough, who was the sponsor of the bill, Congress wanted to make clear that vesting periods were permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.600" offset="11580963">Now, vesting periods do not fall into the age-related cost justification except in, like, term life insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.613" offset="11868937">The first part of that language, the... such as the retirement pension or insurance plan, was emphasized by the Department of Labor in 1969 when it wrote the original regulations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.171" offset="11919196">Like the Court of Appeals in Westinghouse, it thought that the thread common to the sorts of plans that Congress had listed is that the cost of providing benefits often rises as... as employees age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.299" offset="11987742">And it concluded that Congress wanted, by that language, to insure that discrimination was justified in that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.265" offset="13351543">First, Justice Stevens, PERS is asserting trial irrespective of whether it is a pre-existing plan, that is still satisfies the terms of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.704" offset="13389368">And the reason is, is that it is a bona fide employee benefit plan that is not designed to evade... is not designed to be a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.893" offset="13430119">The Act was, first and foremost, a mechanism for insuring the employment of older workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.416" offset="13456137">And certainly, the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio does not in any way interfere with the employment--</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.403" offset="13480170">Well, it isn't just the employment, it also is to insure them equal treatment when they... after they get employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.659" offset="13525100">And certainly PERS does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.511" offset="13532519">It doesn't affect in any way the salary, the employment, the every-day sorts of things than come with working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.381" offset="13560000">All it says... all it does is it makes a distinction based on age in respect to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.185" offset="13583301">And PERS freely admits that if it wasn't for the 4(f)(2) exemption, there would be a problem for PERS in terms of satisfying the terms of the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.076" offset="13622798">But 4(f)(2) is an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.293" offset="13631680">It was intended to permit discrimination in the area of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.080" offset="13650801">Now, one of the big points that has been made here is that PERS didn't put on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.634" offset="13669087">Well, as this Court might recognize, PERS... Ohio is one of those states that doesn't have legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.388" offset="13692075">So we can't go back and figure out exactly what the General Assembly was thinking in 1933, even if we could find anybody who was around who was in the Assembly at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.810" offset="13729796">So, we would urge the Court, that for a public plan, it should go through the same kind of inquiry it would in analyzing the validity of any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.397" offset="13760098">It should look and see what sort of rational basis, what sort of legitimate basis that Ohio had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.051" offset="13782667">And It's not shrouded in mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.003" offset="13794475">Ohio created a retirement plan, and they started off by figuring out that people were going to have to work a certain number of years and be a certain age before they can retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.026" offset="13826658">And then, as the District Court discovered and states clearly in its opinion, then what Ohio did was it provided a benefit for an employee, a disabled employee who wasn't old enough to satisfy age and service, they gave him a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.268" offset="13883605">Now, I don't know why that's arbitrary age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.101" offset="13894890">It wasn't intended to... to affect the employment of older workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.922" offset="13914220">It wasn't intended to affect their salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.124" offset="13926968">It just does what 4(t)(2) says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.076" offset="13938775">And I will tell you that, in Ohio, this piece of legislation would be considered a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.813" offset="13961763">We disagree with Mr. Laufman, that this is a poorly designed statute; we think it says what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.450" offset="14088300">But, I think one has to look at what was it designed to evade; it was designed to evade the restrictions on employment and on compensation other than compensation offered through an employee benefit plan.</text>
