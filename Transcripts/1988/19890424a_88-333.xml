            <text syncTime="520.051" offset="2219258">So that it's that aspect of the plea bargaining that becomes important and which distinguishes, or... or which allows this Court to rule our way without overruling Rice.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.105" offset="2539415">The other readily apparent explanation other than vindictiveness, which I've pointed to in our brief, is that the... after, at the trial, or the, the retrial of the case, the court, then, is much more aware of the defendant's mental and moral attitudes concerning his own... rehabilitation and attitudes in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.654" offset="2641606">And this is illustrated by the facts in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.588" offset="2653413">The judge stated that his decision in increasing the sentence on the retrial was partly... partially based on the defendant's outlook on it, I assume, meaning the... the case, the Defendant's position during trial and "what you said at it", meaning the trial, an apparent reference to the, what the judge considered to be the Defendant's perjury--</text>
            <text syncTime="657.708" offset="2769815">So that, that, this explanation also is readily apparent on the retrial of any... of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.381" offset="2808580">And this is a sufficient explanation for the enhanced sentence versus a presumption that the enhanced sentence is, in fact, a... the product of vindictiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.204" offset="3051833">And I think that's another aspect of this case, that's not before this Court, the... part of the Pearce was protecting the defendant from the fear or the apprehension of... of vindictive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.881" offset="3110556">But that is not present in this case, because, obviously, the Defendant was not afraid of... of appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.618" offset="3133544">And in fact, in... I think it was... well, I don't have... Michigan v. Payne, this Court made the same type of statement that the... so, the only issue, really, before this Court, then, would be the issue of vindictiveness, not the apprehension of the vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.631" offset="3217553">I believe that the facts of this case fully support or illustrate the... the points that I'm trying to make, namely that, at retrial, the judge will always be in possession of more knowledge concerning the facts and the defendant's attitudes concerning his participation in the crime than he is in the guilty plea proceeding that started the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.682" offset="3325700">In our case, at the guilty plea sentencing, the... the Defendant did admit that he had the kni, had a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.538" offset="3353181">He did admit to having sexual intercourse with the victim in this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.458" offset="3384842">However, what was left out and which was subsequently developed at the trial was the atrociousness in the... of the... of the crime, the fact that this attack lasted for over an hour, and the fact that, not just one act of non-consentual sexual intercourse occurred, but that four acts of rape and two acts of sodomy were performed on this woman while the defendant was holding a knife to her throat.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.842" offset="3486406">Now, that's... that idea is contested by the Respondent, the idea of the... knife being held to the Defendant's throat.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.115" offset="3519529">But the, there was a demonstration by the victim in the record, which, the... the judge, observing it, later, in the motion for new trial, determined that that was what was going... what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.791" offset="3578148">And there is no doubt that the victim was... I mean, the Defendant was threatening the victim throughout the... this ordeal with the use of a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.731" offset="3613988">So it's... it's that relationship between the lack of information at a guilty plea versus the full information that the trial judge or the sentencing judge will have that makes the presumption of vindictiveness not appropriate in... in this narrow situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.381" offset="3724538">The other... the other issue we petition, well, if I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebut.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.465" offset="3836864">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="927.417" offset="3848672">The second question presented in this case, the one Mr. Bjurberg was just about to advert to, concerns the type of information on which a judge may rely in increasing the sentence a defendant first received when he pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.410" offset="3900708">That question has considerable practical importance for the federal government, because, under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a judge must always state his reasons for imposing a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.199" offset="3939787">So the circumstances in which a judge, in a case like this, may increase a sentence, directly bears on that second question and is of considerable importance to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.054" offset="3975209">The Respondent argues that, when a defendant withdraws from a guilty plea, he can never thereafter have a sentence increased based on evidence that is developed at a trial and that, even if he can, he could not have his own sentence increased in this case because the reasons given by the trial judge were insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.648" offset="4037589">We think that respondent's arguments are wrong as a matter of law and are irrational as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.302" offset="4060264">The McCullough case decided by this Court three years ago made clear that a trial judge at a second sentencing proceeding may impose an enhanced sentence on a defendant if the judge relies on new and objective facts, facts that were unknown to the judge when he first sentenced the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.163" offset="4123689">That condition was satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.365" offset="4132466">As Mr. Bjurberg explained, at the time the judge resentenced the Defendant, he said that he was unaware that numerous rapes and sodomies had occurred on the night in question, and he said he was unaware that the victim had been threatened with a knife.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.718" offset="4257854">Here, even if a presumption applies, under McCullough, it's clear the presumption can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.121" offset="4283558">And, therefore, the McCullough case and the Rice case have to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.525" offset="4301113">If Rice adopts a presumption that would be applicable here, and we don't think the Court necessarily has to agree with that, but even if it does, under McCullough, that presumption can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.250" offset="4348028">And the judge's reasons in this case are sufficient under McCullough to rebut that presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.154" offset="4483656">There are two different aspect of the ruling in Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.839" offset="4494419">The first is the due process ruling that a defendant cannot be vindictively sentenced simply for having successfully set aside the first judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.029" offset="4523153">That is a basic due process principle, but is not necessarily this... the one that is at issue in a case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.449" offset="4552828">That part, as Justice O'Connor asked, deals with a question of actual vindictiveness, and a defendant can always attempt to show actual vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.039" offset="4583131">But what's at concern here in the first question is whether you should presume that the sentence the judge imposed at the second sentencing proceeding was retaliatory in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.160" offset="4619702">Now, in Rice, it is true, the Court did apply that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.346" offset="4636420">But Rice was the companion case to Pearce, which first adopted this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.666" offset="4653661">Rice preceded, therefore, this Court's decisions in cases like Bordeni ircher and Corbitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.202" offset="4675813">And those cases are significant because those cases make clear that you can extend leniency to a defendant who accepts responsibility and enters a plea, and you can deny the same leniency to a defendant who refuses to accept responsibility and, instead, elects to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.764" offset="4742059">So it's that type of rule which the Court has labeled a prophylactic rule that's at issue in the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.418" offset="4764734">And, just as the Court has been willing in a variety of contexts, such as exclusionary rule or the application of Miranda, to modify prophylactic rules when new situations show that it may be irrational to apply that rule in other contexts, so, too, the Court should be willing to modify the type of rule that was applied to Rice, himself, in light of the changed circumstances that have gone on in the 20 some-odd years we've had since the Pearce case was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.012" offset="4943098">Well, if you distinguish Rice that way and you exclude the plea bargaining process, then, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.416" offset="4960652">But I think one of the reasons for excluding the plea bargaining process is that, in that process, it's well-accepted... in fact, the dissent in the court below stated that it was a custom to afford a defendant leniency in exchange for a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.991" offset="5011016">Now, there will also be cases where a judge extends a defendant leniency in exchange for a plea where there's no plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.045" offset="5031183">That would probably happen normally in what would be called misdemeanors and minor offenses, not major felonies, where someone maybe isn't even represented by a lawyer, who pleads guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.318" offset="5068277">A judge may, in that circumstance, also extend leniency to a defendant simply because the defendant has come in and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.221" offset="5091891">"I did it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.038" offset="5095131">"I'm sorry; I won't do it again and I accept responsibility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.273" offset="5108087">In fact, the federal sentencing guidelines have elevated this custom to a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.375" offset="5124492">A defendant who accepts responsibility, under a plea bargain or not, or even after going to trial, is entitled to credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.897" offset="5150615">So, if you were to limit Rice in the way, uh, I said, just to plea bargains, then you wouldn't have to, as Justice Kennedy asked, overrule the Rice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.670" offset="5189694">However, it's possible that the rationale for limiting Rice to plea bargains would also apply in other cases where there was no plea bargain, because a judge, in fact, bestowed leniency on someone for pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.728" offset="5233893">Respondent makes much ado of two facts in trying to say that the judge did not adequately rebut the presumption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.964" offset="5262837">Respondent first argues that the judge relied on his subjective impression as to the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.385" offset="5284571">That's true, but it's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.570" offset="5293348">As long as the judge relies on new and objective information, a judge is entitled to re-evaluate the heinousness of the crime or the incorrigibility of the defendant in coming to a... a decision as to what particular sentence best serves the deterrent and retributive functions of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.014" offset="5359072">The respondent also argues that there were no new facts elicited regarding the burglary rather than the sexual assaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.603" offset="5385403">That fact is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.703" offset="5393867">What the judge did here, essentially, was put together a sentencing package to try to decide what sentence best served the... the functions of the law and ensured, in this particular case, for example, the respondent either never is released from prison or is released only after serving a very long prison term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.397" offset="5460636">There's no requirement in this Court's decisions, and in fact, the decisions in Wasman and McCullough or to the contrary, that the new facts directly relate to the crime for which the defendant is sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.372" offset="5504522">The McCullough decision and the Wasman decision basically show that what the Court has done, and, I believe, sensibly, has been to re-evaluate through experience the circumstances in which the presumption should apply and at which the presumption can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.965" offset="5562931">That type of re-evaluation was properly applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.339" offset="12504397">We could just as easily say that the judge decided to take into consideration the fact that this defendant had taken an appeal of a burglary conviction and had embarrassed him before the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals by having that court remind the trial judge that the guilty plea was constitutionally deficient.</text>
