            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140928">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.285" offset="153989">Every employee of the National Security Agency has to have a high level security clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.272" offset="181992">That is a statutory requirement for employment at NSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="201219">The question at issue in this case is not what happens to an employee who loses his clearance, for it is clear that he has to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.496" offset="234864">Nor is the question whether the clearance decision itself is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.935" offset="260569">The application of this Court's decisions in Egan and Webster v. Doe will remain open on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.506" offset="286900">The question at issue today is simply what procedures are to be followed by the agency in removing an employee who loses his clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="330786">After briefly stating the background of this case, I will argue that there are three different ways to remove the employee, and the agency is charged with choosing the appropriate procedure in light of the individual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.740" offset="391808">First, the employee can be removed for cause for failure to maintain a required clearance after following all the ordinary procedures afforded to Federal employees dismissed for cause, including MSPB review if the employee is a preference eligible veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="464324">Second, the employee can be suspended and then removed under the summary procedures of 5 U.S.C. 7532 following notice in a hearing if the Secretary of Defense determines that the suspension and the removal are in the interests of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.866" offset="544363">Finally, the employee can be removed without any procedures whatsoever under 50 U.S.C. 833 if the Secretary of Defense determines that that action is in the interest of the United States and that none of the other procedures can be invoked consistently with national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.927" offset="624611">Well, Respondent was employed at the National Security Agency from 1968 until 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.683" offset="651570">In 1982 he disclosed to NSA security officials that while on vacation in foreign countries, he had engaged in homosexual relations with foreign nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.907" offset="696500">He subsequently received a notice of proposed removal on the grounds that his continued access to classified information was no longer clearly consistent with the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.012" offset="740908">Pursuant to NSA regulations governing for-cause removals, he was advised that he had a right to respond, to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.404" offset="778525">He was kept on paid status pending the outcome of his case, but was denied access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.058" offset="805065">Respondent requested and received a psychiatric evaluation in an effort to demonstrate that he did not pose a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.997" offset="840905">A board of appraisal was convened to consider his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.049" offset="857101">Based on the psychiatric report and Respondent's own statements, the board concluded that Respondent had shown poor judgment, that he was emotionally unstable and that he was living beyond his means.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.625" offset="911331">Accordingly, the board concluded that he was a poor security risk and recommended that his clearance be revoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.025" offset="1632938">It implements 5 U.S.C. 7532, which permits the employee to be summarily suspended without pay and then subsequently removed if the director or if the head of the agency determines that it's in the interest of national security.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.099" offset="1901268">But the reason he was removed was for cause for failure to satisfy his statutory condition of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.537" offset="1935018">Now, the Court of Appeals held that the authority of the Director of NSA to remove employees for cause is circumscribed by 5 U.S.C. 7532 which the court says expressly controls terminations in the interest of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.368" offset="2026342">And we think the Court of Appeals reversed the proper relation between 7532 and ordinary for-cause procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.140" offset="2057480">Seventy-five thirty-two by its own terms is an optional, not a mandatory, procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.627" offset="2079423">It states that the Secretary may suspend and remove an employee pursuant to its procedures, but it does purport to lay down a mandatory procedure for every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.916" offset="2120592">It also says that 7532 can be used notwithstanding other statutes, but nothing precludes actions taken pursuant to other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.057" offset="2161134">And this reference to other statutes only makes sense... is referring to provisions like the CSRA that provide protections in ordinary for-cause removals that are not available under the summary procedures of 7532.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.727" offset="3559834">The three statutory procedures for removing employees in these circumstances form sort of a pyramid where the for-cause procedures are the base and cover the broadest ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.450" offset="3610721">Then comes Section 7532, and finally the smallest compass and the most extreme case, Section 833.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.806" offset="3640082">The lines of demarcation between those procedures are not clear-cut, and much is left to the discretion of the agency to choose which one is appropriate in an individual case, but as a general principle, the for-cause procedures are to be used unless there's some reason why they shouldn't be used such as, for example, the employee can't be told the precise reasons why he's being removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.575" offset="3755126">Perhaps it would reveal a source of information that must remain secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.611" offset="3771321">In those circumstances, Section 7532 would be appropriate because it provides for a statement of reasons only to the extent that national security permits; whereas, under the for-cause procedures you have to give him a complete statement of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.204" offset="3825656">The premise of the Court of Appeals' decision and of Respondent's argument appears to be that he would have received more procedures under 7532 than he received under the for-cause procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.950" offset="3912696">The Secretary of Defense, under the prior procedures would have been involved if 7532 had been invoked, but he would also have been suspended without pay for 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.306" offset="3954074">He would have received notice only to the extent consistent with the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.544" offset="3971001">He would have had no right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.177" offset="3977584">He would have had a single hearing of unspecified scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.996" offset="3988869">And if a decision were made to remove him, he would have been ineligible for any other position in the Department of Defense and for any other job elsewhere in government without OPM specifically saying that he's eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.339" offset="4042264">Now, that contrasts sharply with what he actually received, which was 16 months of pay, notice and opportunity to respond, counsel, several layers of intra-agency review, including a personal meeting with the Director of NSA and a recommendation that the agency try to find his employment elsewhere where a clearance was not required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.950" offset="4216657">Everybody else would be worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.486" offset="4226792">There are any number of reasons why the agency might determine that someone's access to classified information is no longer clearly consistent with the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.412" offset="4290531">It could depend on a number of mundane factors such as financial problems, alcohol abuse, mental health concerns, carelessness in the handling of classified material, or simply that a family member has close ties with a hostile country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.589" offset="4355210">Now, in all of those circumstances, the employee may lose his clearance and his job at NSA because NSA cannot tolerate any unnecessary risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.413" offset="4394499">Its mission is too sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.848" offset="4404216">But we're still dealing in those cases with a fairly run-of-the-mine clearance determination, not an emergency such that the procedures of 7532 have to be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.406" offset="4454476">There will, unfortunately, be more dangerous cases from time to time in which an employee has to be excluded from access to classified information and removed immediately and in which perhaps he can't be given a full statement of the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.499" offset="4510900">In those cases, Section 7532 or even Section 833 would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.320" offset="4542143">But it's important to note that it's in the agency's own interest to provide its employees with as much protection as possible to avoid any arbitrary or unnecessary removals and to give the employee himself a sense that he's being treated fairly because a disgruntled ex-employee with classified information poses a grave security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.435" offset="4634616">The ultimate irony of the Court of Appeals' decision is that it seems to mandate a more severe procedure than the agency itself would want to use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.311" offset="4702117">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.302" offset="4750077">We respectfully submit that the decision by the District of Columbia Circuit be affirmed because of the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, a pertinent executive order, the pertinent Department of Defense directive, NSA's own regulations, and the clear mandate of this Court's trilogy of security cases in the 1950's, Cole v. Young, Vitarelli v. Seaton, and Service v. Dulles, which we submit mandate calling a security case a security case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.987" offset="4876824">First of all, I need to emphasize that the mandatory procedures that are at issue in this case are keyed to removal or termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.129" offset="4917366">Much is made in the government's papers about suspension, and that, indeed, is discretionary when you're dealing with security risks, tactical decisions as to whether to suspend now or perhaps watch a person and see what's happening are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.639" offset="4983403">But... and I think this is the answer to Justice Stevens' question about was he suspended without pay and is that a mandatory procedure to trigger these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.077" offset="5021228">The suspension is discretionary, but once you get to removal, these procedures are mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.302" offset="5058113">And the mere fact that the government paid him for some more months should not, we submit, obviate his congressionally mandated head-of-agency review rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.074" offset="5101163">And as is conceded, this was a termination case from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.228" offset="5125823">And in the words of 7532(3), an employee is entitled to the following procedures before removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.285" offset="5166051">And as the D.C. Circuit held, we were entitled, we complain, about not receiving a hearing at the agency authority duly constituted for this purpose, a review of the case by the head of the agency or his designee, and a written statement of the decision by the agency head.</text>
