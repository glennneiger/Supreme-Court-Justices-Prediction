            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="180507">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.193" offset="192628">This case was initiated by Mr. Williams, a prisoner at the Indiana State Reformatory, a maximum security institution, tendering the complaint for filing to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.983" offset="239858">This complaint was tendered pro se and pursuant to 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915 as a pauper's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.423" offset="273608">It was a 42 U.S. Code, Section 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.375" offset="289386">There were five defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.827" offset="295237">The complaint alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment and also due process violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="317807">The district court dismissed the entire case as frivolous, pursuant to Section 1915(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="53.218" offset="340795">Thereafter, the district court allowed on amendment and again dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="366395">The Seventh Circuit affirmed this dismissal as to three of the defendants under both theories, and also as to the remaining two defendants under the due process theory, but revived the action as to the Eighth Amendment against Mr. Neitzke, the hospital administrator, and Dr. Chol, the medical director.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.952" offset="451658">In establishing this case, the Seventh Circuit set forth the following standard:</text>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="475691">"A frivolous complaint is one in which the petitioner can make no rational argument in law or facts to support his or her claim for relief. "</text>
            <text syncTime="96.712" offset="514770">And in making this holding, the court relied on the D.C. Circuit case of Brandon v. District of Columbia Board of Parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.233" offset="544863">The Seventh Circuit, therefore, clearly held that 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915 (d) is not synonymous with the test under 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="115.605" offset="590316">The court specifically agreed with the district court that the Eighth Amendment allegations in this case failed to demonstrate the level of indifference necessary to survive the 12(b) motion under Estelle v. Gamble but nevertheless held that the case should be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.353" offset="673281">It is the Petitioners' contention in this case that a complaint which fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is frivolous within the meaning of 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="148.326" offset="721242">Section 1915 allows access to the federal courts for the poor, as set forth in decision of this Court in Adkins v. DuPont.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.951" offset="759694">There is an already established standard for 12(b)(6) for pro se complaints which is, when it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.875" offset="815387">This Court set forth this standard in Conley, reaffirmed it in Halnes, and indeed in Estelle v. Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.429" offset="841614">It's Petitioners' contention that this standard is low enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.150" offset="860527">The issues in this case deal with how the district courts should handle the congressional mandate of Section 1915(d) not to permit frivolous or malicious complaints under pauper's petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.676" offset="918623">We are not addressing here the variety of methodology by which various circuit courts have tried to handle this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.115" offset="956344">We are talking about the lowest permissible standard as opposed to another standard that may be established in a different circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.602" offset="982258">It is Petitioners' contention that a complaint which does not meet the pro se test for a 12(b)(6) motion is a minimum beneath which no complaint should be allowed to be filed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="225.160" stopTime="234.082">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="225.160" offset="1028547">When you say it doesn't meet the pro se test, Mr. Spear, you're talking about the rule that pro se complaints are liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_spear" startTime="234.082" stopTime="252.294">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="234.082" offset="1064178">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.867" offset="1067417">The Petitioners in this case would submit that instead a test should be establishing using 12(b)(6) as the standard beneath which the legal sufficiency of the complaint should not be allowed to go for purposes of Section 1915(b).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="252.294" stopTime="284.282">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.294" offset="1137111">Mr. Spear, at least on, on the face of the language there appear to be differences between the two provisions, and it isn't really clear to me that they would necessarily be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.654" offset="1194476">Do you think that Rule 11, which is designed, according to the notes, to help eliminate frivolous claims, is implicated every time a complaint is dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_spear" startTime="284.282" stopTime="327.359">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="284.282" offset="1265007">No, Your Honor, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.032" offset="1272008">But it is a showing under Rule 11 that you must show, in order to avoid this sanction as a plaintiff, that you have a basis in fact and in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.090" offset="1320282">If you do not have a basis in law, Rule 11 sanctions would apply in a situation where the standard was not closed, but not... would only apply... would not apply in those rare cases where it is not clear-cut whether or not the complaint fails to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.967" offset="1391753">In short, although many cases, perhaps most that reach this Court, there is a serious question of the sufficiency of the legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.038" offset="1416099">At the district court level, the vast majority of complaints are fairly readily apparent whether they meet the 12(b)(6) standard.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="327.359" stopTime="337.381">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="327.359" offset="1437311">Well, do you think that the frivolous and malicious standard under the statute applies to factual as well as legal aspects of the complaint?</text>

            <text syncTime="349.855" offset="1527276">We note in our brief that several circuits, specifically in at least one instance in the Second, and the Eleventh and the Fifth and the Fourth, rather frequently do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.794" offset="1563116">Now, we are not suggesting--</text>

            <text syncTime="369.436" offset="1605644">That is not, however, the case that is in front of the Court today and we'd also point out, Your Honor, that probably when it talks about frivolous--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="378.875" stopTime="384.343">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="378.875" offset="1643365">Well, do you think under Rule 12(b) that one does that, or does one look just to the face of the complaint?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_spear" startTime="384.343" stopTime="513.542">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="384.343" offset="1665307">--The face of the complaint, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.445" offset="1669696">And we are only dealing with with the legal sufficiency here under a frivolous test.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.981" offset="1683802">Normally one would suspect that since the language of the statute isn't disjunctive of frivolous or malicious... malicious may very well tend to be factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.770" offset="1722986">For instance, if a party were to bring a hundred lawsuits within a period of a few weeks or multiple lawsuits against the same person for the same facts, that would tend to fall under the malicious side of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.894" offset="1763423">That's not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.210" offset="1768752">This is on the frivolous side of the test, and in front of us we have a pure legal test.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.548" offset="1786098">We would submit further that the Rule 11 standard, which has been proposed by the Respondent in this case, is particularly inappropriate for use in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.570" offset="1826222">Rule 11 is used by the district courts as a sanction and a deterrent to paying plaintiffs and to their lawyers for filing complaints which are either not based correctly in the law or not based correctly factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.281" offset="1892991">They have to meet both tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.948" offset="1903649">It is not appropriate to use such a standard for plaintiffs who on their face cannot be deterred or, or punished in any fashion for bringing a frivolous complaint when they have, on their face, tendered a proper pauper's petition and literally have no assets upon which to levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.064" offset="1988181">The test that we are attempting to have this Court establish, although it has not reached this Court yet, has already been established in our opinion in eight of the circuits, and only the Seventh Circuit and the D.C. Circuit have found that a complaint can go lower than a 12(b)(6) motion standard and still survive in some viable fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.894" offset="2071459">The test, in fact, is broader in both the Eleventh Circuit and, at least in one case, in the Second.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.064" offset="2096119">We are not contending that here today because it has not simply reached this basis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.702" offset="2122659">The standard method in the Southern District of Indiana and the Northern District is that a complaint is referred to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.356" offset="2149304">The magistrate makes findings that, in fact, it states a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.776" offset="2171038">He has the power to order a file and then process is served.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="513.542" offset="2182114">Well, Mr. Spear, you say that in the Southern District of Indiana the complaint is referred to a magistrate and the magistrate makes findings as to whether it states a claim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_spear" startTime="524.266" stopTime="545.847">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="524.266" offset="2224955">Your Honor, the magistrate examines the complaint and if it, in his opinion, states a claim, he has the power to order a file and process it, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.705" offset="2258705">If in fact in his opinion it does not state a claim, or is frivolous under the 1915(d) standard, he makes a recommendation and sends it to a district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.961" offset="2295694">And the district judge makes the determination of whether or not the complaint is filed or not filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.669" offset="2338535">These are legal findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.486" offset="2341879">And, in fact, in the Seventh Circuit the only test... there is no factual test prior to filing... the only test is the legal test.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.984" offset="2435815">In... in an adversarial proceeding in front of a magistrate sometimes... with lawyers on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.305" offset="2461102">We're not suggesting that procedure here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.907" offset="2467476">We... We have not reached that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.990" offset="2475835">We have a single issue on the legal sufficiency at the single complaint under the current standards used by the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.048" offset="3788122">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="917.667" offset="3798571">This case concerns the question of whether the standard for dismissal of frivolous actions under Section 1915(d) is the same as the standard for dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="928.207" offset="3840680">Respondent submits that it is not, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.342" offset="3853219">First, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and other principles of our adversary system, sharply distinguish between frivolous actions to warrant the imposition of sanctions in a complaint that simply fails to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.217" offset="3900762">In particular, a motion to dismiss for a failure to state a claim raises a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.454" offset="3925735">This question of law may not be frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.173" offset="3936602">Petitioners propose that the district courts should always routinely resolve these questions of law, even when they present major questions of constitutional law, without the benefit of an adversary presentation by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.182" offset="3992609">Second, the literal terms of Section 1915(d), its legislative history, and the prior decisions of this Court, require the same standards of frivolousness to apply in actions by litigants as... in actions by indigents as in actions by ordinary litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.025" offset="4056034">When Congress used the phrase 1915(d), it did not mean failure to state a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.438" offset="4233667">The legislative history does not speak to the content of the phrase frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.858" offset="4251325">The single most common use of the word frivolous in the opinions of this Court before 1892 concerns the procedure for dismissing an appeal for failure to present a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.083" offset="4304197">And, indeed, the rules of this Court in their 1878 version, Supreme Court Rule 6, specifically allowed a motion to affirm on the ground that the question on which jurisdiction depends is so frivolous as not to need further argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.259" offset="4360935">If Congress was aware of any standard usage of the word frivolous, it was aware of its equivalence with failure to state a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.631" offset="4402418">Moreover, that's exactly what this Court held much later in Coppedge against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.269" offset="4424987">This Court held that a pauper's appeal could be dismissed only when a paying litigant's appeal could be dismissed, only when it failed to state a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.160" offset="4468560">Respondent submits that failure to state a substantial federal question is virtually identical to the standard adopted by the court of appeals in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.802" offset="4623100">This Court held in Bell against Hood that the question whether there was a claim directly under Fourth Amendment presented a substantial federal question, even though the district court might on an adversary presentation dismiss because the complaint failed to state a claim after the district court held that there was no such cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.875" offset="4867397">The court of appeals said that it was perfectly appropriate for a dismissal under Section 1915(d) to be done sua sponte if there was no rational basis in law or fact for the plaintiffs' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.350" offset="4921314">And, indeed, in this very case the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of almost all of the plaintiffs' claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.737" offset="5242829">We believe that the federal courts will do a better job in handling these cases, and we admit they pose problems for the federal districts courts if it asks the defendants simply to submit a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under the Federal Rules.</text>

I believe the exact words are that a court can grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts at trial that would entitle him to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.341" offset="7349239">Haines against Kerner, like any standard for dismissal for failure to state a claim, doesn't give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.512" offset="7385915">That is precisely what the court of appeals said was appropriate in these cases in which there was some question about the sufficiency of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.218" offset="7420814">Moreover, I believe that as a matter of judicial administration it would only confuse the lower federal courts if the standard, which is perfectly suitable for one purpose under 12(b)(6), is suddenly transplanted to be used to determine what constitutes frivolous actions under Section 1915(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.164" offset="7488524">This Court would never take that step with a paying litigant, risking the confusion that might arise from confusing Rule 12 with Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.471" offset="7529797">Nor would this Court take this step with respect to assessing attorney's fees against civil rights plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.058" offset="7556129">This Court has clearly said in Christianburg Garment, case decided under Title 7 but now applied under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Statute, generally, that attorney's fees can be assessed against a civil rights plaintiff only if the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.337" offset="7625196">Moreover, in a prior decision, this Court has squarely held in Hughes against Rowe that a prisoner's complaint could fail to state a claim, yet would not justify the imposition of sanctions under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.112" offset="7692383">Your Honor, the Petitioners rely quite heavily upon the statement in the court of appeals opinion that the complaint failed to demonstrate the level of deliberate indifference necessary to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.776" offset="7770960">We contend that this statement is simply a dictum, that what the court meant was that there was some doubt about the sufficiency of the complaint, as it went on to state explicitly in the very next sentence in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.103" offset="7824354">Moreover, the overall order of the court of appeals is consistent with this interpretation of its statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.173" offset="7848596">The court of appeals sent the case back down to the district court for further adversary proceedings on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.010" offset="7879942">To the extent that Petitioners rely upon this statement, we contend, for reasons elaborated in Part IV in our brief, that the complaint specifically alleges, often with supporting evidence in exhibits attached to the complaint, that Respondent suffered a deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.228" offset="7980775">In any event, this dictum is just another example of the procedural complications that ensue from sua sponte dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.100" offset="8020272">In its opinion, the court of appeals plainly meant to establish an orderly procedure for disposition of actions brought by indigent litigants, to have the district court first consider sua sponte whether a complaint has any rational basis in law or fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.526" offset="8073980">If it does, then to have process served upon the defendant and entertain a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.497" offset="8097908">If the court then granted the motion to dismiss, the case would come to the court of appeals, as it does in ordinary appellant practice, with the benefit of the district court's considered judgment after a presentation of the issues on the sufficiency of the complaint by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.440" offset="8161647">It is that procedure, not the effect of an unconsidered dictum of the court of appeals, that constitutes the only question of general significance before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.462" offset="8197696">We believe that the court of appeals decided it correctly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Spear</label>
            <text syncTime="2126.751" offset="8634881">--Your Honor, we would submit that there the Seventh Circuit has adopted a much lower standard and an unenforceable standard when it differed from the other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.289" offset="8673020">You had earlier asked the question about when the statute was originally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.324" offset="8685245">It was, in fact, originally adopted in 1892 and recodified in 1948 after the rules, of course, had been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.245" offset="8712831">But in 1892 Congress was locking at a system where the courts refused to cemure a system, and even learned lawyers had difficulty stating a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.501" offset="8753895">Cases would go back, would be repled two or three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.468" offset="8765807">The different situation we have today with the modern rules and with the standard established under Haines and under Conley, that, that we would submit that in fact the current standard of 12(b)(6) is in fact, as interpreted by this Court for pro se plaintiffs, the equivalent of a frivolous standard as it would have existed in 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.199" offset="8844697">There is a practical aspect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.651" offset="8854519">As the record shows, the court had already gone through this procedure, and had to go through this procedure under the Seventh Circuit no matter what the outcome was below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.792" offset="8903107">That is to say, the district court had already examined the complaint and weeded out three of the defendants and half the claims against the remaining two defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.545" offset="8930065">And it would have to do that under 1915(d) even if it had filed the complaint as the Seventh Circuit ordered it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.033" offset="8955978">It's still going to go through the same test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.768" offset="8962979">The magistrate is going to examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.520" offset="8969980">The district court is going to examine it at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.603" offset="8978339">What the test that's argued for by the respondent in this case, however, would do was cause the same process to happen twice because, assuming the complaint is then filed, the defendants are brought into court and they are penalized in effect... they are sued... they must defend themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.965" offset="9043750">At that point, the pro se petitioner files his response and the district court goes through the same analysis to determine whether or not the case states a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.171" offset="9080530">The identical analysis that it underwent before it allowed the case to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.808" offset="9103100">We would submit that that does not cause a judicial economy and it makes no rational sense to have that kind of a test when you have to do exactly the... the courts do exactly the same thing twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.449" offset="9149702">Plus, it burdens the defendants, plus it burdens the other potential plaintiffs in the whole system, which is now clogged, to say the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.222" offset="9184811">That kind of a standard does not assist the district court in following what Congress has told it it must do, and that is winnow out these cases, and, in fact, the Seventh Circuit has said they must do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.594" offset="9230264">We would continue to submit, Your Honors, that a system that causes the same complaint to be examined for the same standard twice by the district court is not the system that should be adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.270" offset="9288987">Rather, this Court should adopt the familiar and identifiable standard of 12(b)(6) as instructions for the district courts and the circuit courts, to allow them to implement the congressional policy of Section 1915(d) in a way that they can define and get a handle on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.382" offset="9353458">The questions of this Court to learned counsel here show that in a specific case it was very difficult for him to define a rule that shows well, yes, it's below 12(b)(6), but how far below is it before it still must be dismissed because there's no... any question of any of the parties in this case or the courts that at some point 1915(d) does kick in and there is a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.212" offset="9432765">The question is not whether there is any standard prior to filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.430" offset="9445618">The question is what is that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.497" offset="9453872">And we would submit that the way to handle that in a method that's enforceable by the courts is to use 12(b)(6) because it is a standard that the lawyers, the courts, the judges are familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.922" offset="9495564">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
