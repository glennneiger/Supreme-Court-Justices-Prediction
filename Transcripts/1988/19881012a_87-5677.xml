            <text syncTime="982.067" offset="4057354">Yes, but there are going to be instances where the state court hasn't told you, they've been obscure as to the whether or not there is a procedural default, either legally or factually in the context, and the danger of presuming in favor of default in those instances, as I said, is that important individual rights may be lost simply because the state court judge was obscure about his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.350" offset="4150559">And I think when you're dealing with individual liberty, that kind of ambiguity or obscurity just should not be tolerated, should not block Federal review of the habeas issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.442" offset="4210850">And I think that this Court... if you look at the Court's decisions in this area over the years, you've seen the rule developed in the direct review cases, of about the plain statement rule, but you've also seen the rule develop in the habeas cases that if the state court has disposed of the Federal issue, then the Federal courts have an unflagging duty to resolve or to review the correctness of the state court's decision on the Federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.844" offset="4320460">Going back, way back to Brown v. Allen... Brown v. Allen said that if there's an adequate and independent State grounds, then habeas review is going to be foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.049" offset="4353269">But they went on to give some exceptions to that, and one of those exceptions is right on point here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.219" offset="4581998">Generally speaking, not exclusively, the Michigan v. Long line of cases deal with situations in which the state is contending that the state courts have given more protection to a Federal Constitutional claim than the Constitution actually warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.831" offset="4652424">In the habeas situation, it's the exact reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.966" offset="4664963">Typically the defendant is claiming that he was deprived of protection the Constitution would provide him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.853" offset="4688577">Do you think that distinction has any significance and which way does it cut?</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.923" offset="4704773">I don't think it has a significance, because I would call Your Honors' attention to the fact that that Michigan... although that was the context of Michigan v. Long, that plain statement rule has been applied subsequently in a procedural default case, in Caldwell v. Mississippi, where the defendant failed to, failed to raise his Constitutional issue on appeal, and his conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.373" offset="4802576">And then it went to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which raised the issue sua sponte, split four to four over it, and then it went to this Court on certiorari, and I, I think Justice Marshall was writing for the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.167" offset="4873733">He made it very clear there that the mere existence of a procedural bar is not going to foreclose this Court's direct review jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.690" offset="4911872">On the contrary, the state court actually had to have relied upon the procedural bar before this Court will decline jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.283" offset="4966207">So I think, Your Honor is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.950" offset="4972894">That was the context of Michigan v. Long.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.686" offset="9471807">My opponent argues that there should be a presumption that the State Courts have followed their procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.826" offset="9520394">I certainly don't have any quarrel with that, but the presumption should recognize that the State Courts, in following their procedural rules, sometimes invoke procedural default and sometimes excuse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.818" offset="9568355">I think the plain statement rule would recognize that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.538" offset="9587268">My opponents also argue that there should be a presumption in procedural default whenever there's ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.776" offset="9612241">And I would remind my opponent that that very presumption in favor of dismissal has been rejected by this Court in the context of direct review in the Michigan v. Long case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.833" offset="9668456">There, the Court said that it would not dismiss the case outright if the State Court had been ambiguous or obscure concerning whether it relied on an adequate and independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.057" offset="9717358">On the contrary, the Court there said that it would presume in those instances that the court had disposed of the issue on the Federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.615" offset="9755601">And now my opponents are arguing basically for the reverse presumption in the context of habeas review, but have identified no good reasons that I've heard here today--</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.522" offset="10003242">It's not... it cannot be raised in the first instance in the Federal court, because the state court didn't give any indication that, that its review of the Federal issue was barred because of the procedural default, and I think Justice Stevens said in County Court of Ulster that if a state court doesn't indicate that, that review of the Federal issue is precluded by the state's procedural bar, then the Federal Court certainly implies no disrespect for the state courts by entertaining the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.673" offset="10115777">My opponents also say that the cause and prejudice rule provides some kind of safety net here, but the cause and prejudice test was never intended as a safety net for obscure state court opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.849" offset="10168545">There is certainly no authority for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.551" offset="10179307">In Wainwright v. Sykes, the Court didn't charge ahead to determine whether or not there was cause and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.705" offset="10207937">Instead, they first, the Court first addressed in detail whether or not there was in fact an adequate and independent State grounds for the state court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.346" offset="10250465">You don't just jump over that and rely on the, rely on the, rely on the cause of prejudice test as some kind of safety net here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.452" offset="10286932">Finally, I think that maybe I should conclude with an analogy to a baseball rule, since I know noted the Court's reliance on baseball precedent this morning, and since we are approaching the seventh game of the National League series tonight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.163" offset="10361746">It's settled in baseball that a tie between the runner and the ball goes to the runner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.317" offset="10382331">I think it's equally settled in the context of direct review that a tie between the procedural default and the Federal issue goes to the Federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.173" offset="10421828">And now, I think, what we have here is the state is trying to change the rules of the ball game just because we're here on habeas review instead of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.113" offset="10461534">And as I've said today and in our briefs, there really isn't any different... there isn't any good reason to treat ambiguity in the context of direct review any differently than in habeas review.</text>
