            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86568">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Company versus the County Commissioner of Webster County, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.393" offset="116139">The petitioners in these cases are coal companies that own property in Webster County, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.188" offset="139231">Over a period of more than 10 years, their property was taxed significantly more than comparable properties in the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.819" offset="165771">These disparities were solely the result of a tax assessment policy adapted by the Webster County tax assessor in which she would use the last sale price of the property as the value of the land for assessment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.766" offset="217598">If the property had not been recently conveyed, she would carry over its assessment from the previous year and occasionally make a minor adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.273" offset="247587">A petitioner's assessments were far higher than the carried over assessments of comparable neighboring properties despite the occasional adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.037" offset="282695">The West Virginia Court of Appeals held that petitioners could not complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.510" offset="300563">Their property was assessed at no more than its current value, and any complaint about the under-evaluation of neighboring property could only be remedied by an action to raise those other assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.611" offset="344971">We find the Webster County assessment scheme violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it creates significant assessment differences between similar parcels and does not equalize them in a reasonable amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.540" offset="400664">We also hold that petitioners cannot be limited to seeking an increase in the taxes of others rather than the reduction in their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.467" offset="428354">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is therefore, reversed.</text>
