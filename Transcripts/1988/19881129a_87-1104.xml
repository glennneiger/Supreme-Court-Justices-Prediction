            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144140">We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1104, Walter Zant v. William Neal Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.857" offset="175487">Ms. Boleyn, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="17.338" stopTime="215.726">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="17.338" offset="213417">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.712" offset="222925">This is a second application for federal habeas corpus relief that raises both old and new grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.240" offset="245077">On the new grounds, they allege that a change in the law permits them to present these new claims for the first time in a second or subsequent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.127" offset="280604">It's the Petitioner's position that the failure of the Respondent to include these so-called new claims in his first application was inexcusable neglect and, therefore, this application should have been dismissed as an abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.217" offset="328982">There are three major points which the Petitioner would like to discuss today and these three points are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.089" offset="352493">First, when a district court is faced with reviewing a second or subsequent application for federal habeas corpus relief that raises new claims based on alleged changes in the law, the district court should not focus on whether or not the decision that's cited by the applicant is in fact new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.644" offset="422710">Instead, the proper focus of the district court's consideration should be whether at the time the first application was filed and it was pending in the district court that the claim was reasonably available to the applicant at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.139" offset="476627">The second point the Petitioner would like to make is that reasonably available means was there a sufficient legal basis in existence at the time the first application was filed and during the time it was pending to enable the applicant to raise the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.492" offset="534096">And finally, under our standard that we're proposing to the Court today, the burden would remain on the applicant to excuse his omission of the new claims from the earlier application and to show that it was not inexcusable neglect to fail to include these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.956" offset="591879">If we take the reasonably available standard that we're propounding to the Court today and apply it in the practical context, this is what occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.483" offset="621972">Of course, the applicant files a second or successive application for federal habeas corpus relief and the government, as is its burden, pleads abuse of the writ with clarity and particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.181" offset="664813">And essentially implicit in our response to their second or successive application is our belief that there is no newly available facts and no newly available law which would allow the applicant to raise a claim at this time which he didn't have at a previous application time.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.815" offset="735343">Of course, once we plead abuse of the writ and we say that there's new... no new law, then of course the applicant has to respond to the pleading of abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.577" offset="774422">And what generally happens is they simply say change in the law and they cite a case for it that was rendered subsequent to the time that the first application was disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.074" offset="808382">They hope by mouthing what are sometimes thought of as magic words of "change in the law", that they can thereby excuse their inexcusable neglect in failing to raise that claim at the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.256" offset="853103">And, of course, they also hope that what will happen is that the district court will look to the government to determine whether or not the claim was reasonably available at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.582" offset="886436">When the district court then is faced with our allegation of abuse of the writ and their allegation that there's new law, what does the district court have to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.000" offset="920081">Well, essentially the district court can't decide whether the decision is new law in a legal vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.528" offset="942233">Instead, what the district court has to do is look at the claim and decide whether or not at the time the first application was filed and was pending that the claim was reasonably available.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.337" offset="985387">So, they compare the date of the decision cited back to the date that the first application was filed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="215.726" stopTime="225.362">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="215.726" offset="1007017">Ms. Boleyn, may I inquire how your proposed standard differs from that in Reed against Ross for the novelty standard for procedural defaults?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="225.362" stopTime="285.306">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="225.362" offset="1045573">Your Honor, our reasonably available standard differs from the, the standards set forth in Reed v. Ross for the cause standard in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.624" offset="1078592">First of all, our standard is not as high a standard as a Reed v. Ross standard because we don't have the additional element of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.324" offset="1105342">And second, of course, primarily when you're discussing a procedural default, you're looking at whether counsel failed to preserve the issue and why the issue was not preserved; whereas on our reasonably available standard, the focus that you have is why the claim could not have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.475" offset="1165946">So, really in a procedural default context, a Reed v. Ross type situation, one of the things you're looking at is foreseeability; whereas in our test you have the benefit of hindsight and you can look back to the legal environment as it existed at the time the first application was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.673" offset="1218818">Then, of course, too, when you're looking at a procedural default context, the prior proceeding that you're examining is a proceeding in which you had the right to counsel and you had the right to effective assistance because it's trial or appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.372" offset="1261554">But in our standard, you're looking at a proceeding where you did not have the right to counsel and so, in effect, it just doesn't factor in.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="285.306" stopTime="292.070">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="285.306" offset="1285273">How does your standard differ from that suggested by Judge Tjoflat below?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="292.070" stopTime="323.650">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="292.070" offset="1312336">Our standard is very similar to that of Judge Tjoflat.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.022" offset="1324143">We just... he, he used the tools language of Reed v. Ross, and we simply said was it reasonably available, was there a sufficient legal basis for the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.003" offset="1356117">And it's similar for the tools language that Judge Tjoflat adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.470" offset="1373985">The only thing that Judge Tjoflat did was he referred to the Reed v. Ross language about whether other petitioners were raising the claim at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.201" offset="1400943">And we've simply said in our standard that that might be germane, but it might not be outcome-determinative in determining whether the claim was reasonably available.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.371" offset="1429573">So, it's very similar to what he's... what he's alleged.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="323.650" stopTime="352.342">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="323.650" offset="1438664">Could you... could you tell me how it could ever be held that the claim... that the claim was not reasonably available when there has been a change in the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="340.471" offset="1505956">I mean, almost by definition somebody else thought of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.626" offset="1514628">So, how could you possibly ever... I mean, why not just adopt a simpler rule that you simply can't do it at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="350.249" offset="1545035">Period.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.593" offset="1546498">Is there any difference?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="352.342" stopTime="395.763">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="352.342" offset="1553498">We think we have adopted a simpler rule because part of it depends on the way you look at new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.152" offset="1576695">I mean, new law could be viewed as every decision that this Court decides or every decision that any court decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.024" offset="1600205">So, the question can't focus on whether it's new law unless you relate it to some point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.867" offset="1619536">To say whether it's new law for retroactivity purposes or new law for prophylactic purposes, all different types of purposes is where it's new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.535" offset="1650256">So, the only way you can do when you're in a habeas corpus setting is you have to look at the conduct of the applicant for the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.158" offset="1672721">And when you're looking at his conduct, you have to look at the point in time when he sought to avail himself of the federal habeas corpus remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.640" offset="1698635">So, the new law or the, the decision only has relevance in the context of the habeas corpus proceeding back to the time of the first application.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="395.763" stopTime="422.283">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="395.763" offset="1727160">But at least if he... if his trial where he didn't raise the point was simultaneous with the trial in which the point was raised that came up here that produced the decision which is allegedly new law, at least in all those cases you would have to say it was reasonably available, wouldn't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="417.207" offset="1812947">So, you would only be talking about those cases that were earlier than the one at which the point was first raised.</text>

          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="422.283" stopTime="430.671">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="422.283" offset="1833218">You would only be talking about those cases that were earlier than the one in which the point raised, but that would not necessarily be an excuse because you could have--</text>

            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="430.936" offset="1867804">--earlier decisions that foreshadowed the new or clear break or precedent-setting decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.075" offset="1884418">We're not going to have to wait until this Court gives a decision to hold that it would be reasonable for an applicant to raise the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.495" offset="1910018">Of course, as this Court is aware, many of the 1960s and 1970 cases clearly outlined for persons dealing in federal habeas corpus the expansion of rights that was going to be available to criminal defendants and foreshadowed many of the decisions that came out in the 1970s and 1980s.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.894" offset="1967696">So, you had the tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.160" offset="1972711">You had these basic decisions, and applying them to the factual context in which you're dealing with is the job of the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.267" offset="2001133">He has got to have some ability to determine whether there are some, some basic landmark cases out there that might be extended to cover the factual situation that's in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.732" offset="2043033">Can you give me some specific examples of decisions of this Court that the Petitioner could rely on as new law under your standard?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="481.995" stopTime="540.190">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="481.995" offset="2072081">--Your Honor, that's a difficult question to ask unless you can pinpoint the time period that we're talking about I think, as I've already said.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.553" offset="2102279">But let's suppose that you are a, a capital litigant in Georgia in the period between Gregg v. Georgia, 1976, and Green v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.064" offset="2148359">And in Green v. Georgia, of course, they said that the hearsay prohibitions under Georgia law weren't applicable to the sentencing phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.718" offset="2170929">It's possible that a petitioner in that time period between those two decisions would have no reasonably available basis to allege that the hearsay prohibitions that are... that are in the guilt phase were also applicable to the sentencing phase since those two phases under Georgia law are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.118" offset="2236548">So, it's arguable that that's an example of a case which was clearly new law, at least under Georgia law, to require those hearsay restrictions to be taken out of the sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.458" offset="2273956">So, arguably he might have a, a claim based on that that would be excusable neglect for failing to raise it in the first application.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.190" offset="2304884">And no examples occur to you of our decisions in the 1980s?</text>

            <text syncTime="542.502" offset="2314080">Your Honor, I've spent a lot of time thinking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.811" offset="2331320">Some of the major 1980s examples that I can think of would depend on the state of the law in other states of which I'm unfamiliar.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.184" offset="2360787">For example, Caldwell v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.121" offset="2368623">The Caldwell... so-called Caldwell argument has been against the law in Georgia for 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.666" offset="2390775">Apparently it wasn't against the law in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.165" offset="2400702">So, perhaps some applicant, depending on the timing of their first and second applications, Caldwell v. Mississippi might be new law in their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.927" offset="2435810">So, the problem is if you... if you don't place it in the context of a particular jurisdiction or a particular time frame, it's difficult to answer whether some of the major decisions that we're all familiar with really would be an excuse in the abstract.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.354" offset="2537479">First of all, you'd have to look at what would be reasonable in that time frame, what decisions they had that might have foreshadowed Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.164" offset="2564751">And that's why I say it's possibly an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.507" offset="2574155">It wouldn't necessarily be an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.208" offset="2580947">And the only reason I use that is because I'm familiar with Georgia law, so that might possibly be an excuse for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.004" offset="2600068">But even still, of course, you know, stare decisis and all of the decisions of the Court really rely on something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.142" offset="2624623">The question is maybe under Georgia law or some other authority that I'm not familiar with, that claim could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.125" offset="2644581">But the fact that... that somebody was... was smart enough to raise a claim that ultimately got relief doesn't necessarily mean that it was unreasonable for them not to raise it previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.839" offset="2683451">If we apply the reasonably available analysis to the new law claims in this application, this is what results.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.225" offset="2725038">There's two new law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.303" offset="2733293">The first of these in our case is the Proffitt v. Wainwright claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.551" offset="2746249">And essentially when we pled abuse of the writ, the Respondent in this case said I needed Proffitt to make this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.502" offset="2778119">Without Proffitt, this claim was unavailable to me at the time of the first application.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.493" offset="3006011">--Insofar as some courts have read Sanders to limit abuse of the writ solely to types of things like sandbagging or deliberate withholding, I would disagree with those interpretations of Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.567" offset="3054390">My interpretation of Sanders is that it prohibits any types of abuse of the writ and it gives illustrative examples that we say are nonexhaustive of what type of proceedings would abuse the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.812" offset="3099320">But when they put that word "delay" in there, they're talking about capital litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.686" offset="3114785">They are talking about the fact that it's commonplace now for capital litigants to file a second round of federal habeas corpus proceedings whose only intent is to delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.604" offset="3154491">And so that part of Sanders directly feeds in to this case and to our, our abuse of the writ standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.008" offset="3176120">Again, if we try to apply the reasonably available standard to the two claims that we have here, the first one is Proffitt v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.848" offset="3207467">And as I've said, they said until the Fifth Circuit entered Proffitt v. Wainwright, we could not have raised the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.690" offset="3230873">Under our analysis, then of course in our pleading of abuse of the writ, we would tell them, as we did tell them, that Proffitt was based on... primarily on Gardner v. Florida, and that in Gardner v. Florida in 1977 this Court clearly foreshadowed the result that the Fifth Circuit reached in Proffitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.979" offset="3300045">And, of course, Gardner was decided in 1977, and this application, the federal habeas corpus relief, the initial one, was filed in November of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.773" offset="3335154">And then, of course, Gardner had prior law supporting it: this Court, Douglas v. Alabama, California v. Green, Chambers v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.660" offset="3366710">So, if you didn't want to use Gardner, you still had other similar decisions of this Court that you could have relied on.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.170" offset="3436718">So, essentially they said we needed Proffitt to make this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.917" offset="3455735">Our response is you didn't need the... you didn't need Proffitt because you had Gardner v. Florida and the prior decisions in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.226" offset="3484992">And therefore, since you didn't need it to raise the claim, the claim was reasonably available to you in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.802" offset="3507249">Since it was reasonably available, your failure to present it was inexcusable neglect, and since inexcusable neglect is one of the forms of abuse of the writ now that abuses have become more sophisticated, then therefore you have abused the writ of habeas corpus and you are not entitled to review this issue on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.343" offset="3577466">With reference to the other new law claim, Estelle v. Smith, again we apply the reasonably available test to Estelle v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.151" offset="3608708">They say until this Court's decision in Estelle v. Smith, they couldn't have raised the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.273" offset="3637129">You could have raised In re Gault.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.257" offset="3645071">You could have used Miranda v. Arizona, and you could have even used the district court's decision in Smith v. Estelle, which was decided one year before this first application was filed, and if not that, you could have used the Fifth Circuit's decision in Smith v. Estelle, which was entered while the application was pending in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.312" offset="3713302">So, we essentially say you didn't need this Court's decision in Estelle v. Smith to raise the Estelle v. Smith claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.654" offset="3742664">And since you didn't need it, the claim was reasonably available to you, and your failure to present it constituted inexcusable neglect, which should have been dismissed as abuse of the writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.336" offset="5493391">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.272" offset="5517214">There are two central questions on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.693" offset="5530902">The first is whether the federal courts have the authority to modify standards that were established by Congress for the evaluation of new constitutional claims that are presented for the first time in a second habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.562" offset="5590357">This question has a subpart: may the federal court substitute a standard that is stricter, less equitable and harsher to habeas defendants?</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.150" offset="5628705">The second central question in this case involves the decision of the district court to dismiss Mr. Moore's constitutional challenge to the state's use of a presentence report at his sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.661" offset="5678756">The district court dismissed the challenge... and I'll answer your question now, Justice Stevens... without ever addressing its merits, either on the first application or the second one, finding it to be an abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.907" offset="5727761">The question here presented with respect to that Gardner claim is whether the district court should reconsider its dismissal in the ends of justice when the presentence report in question was so marred by false and misleading information that it provoked the district court to find... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.962" offset="5803934">"that sufficient likelihood exists that a wrongful sentence was imposed on Mr. Moore based on inadequate information. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.677" offset="5838834">If I may, I'll begin with the first of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.784" offset="5855239">Our principal submission is that the standards that govern successive habeas corpus petitions have been set by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.250" offset="5889093">While fair-minded persons undoubtedly disagree and disagree sharply on the wisest treatment of such petitions, Congress itself during a 40-year dialogue with the Judicial Conference, with attorneys general, with other interested parties, none of them shy, has repeatedly considered the diverse policy interests and has struck for itself a clear balance that's reflected in 2244(b) and Rule 9(b), which embody its own legislative judgment about how the competing interests should be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.015" offset="6048127">If federal courts are bound by the congressional choices reflected in 2244 and Rule 9, the judgment of the court of appeals, though not its precise holding, should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.875" offset="6195562">This Court, through the Rules Enabling Act, promulgated rules for adoption by... approval by Congress, including a Rule 9(b), that had different language from what finally appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.839" offset="6239448">The language was "not excusable".</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.729" offset="6246971">Congress held up the enactment or the approval of that set of rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.958" offset="6611954">The rule in Sanders reflected it... the judgment that what was of concern were parties who had deliberately withheld new claims or who had engaged in conduct that was inexcusably neglectful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.263" offset="6681126">The court pointed to the kind of conduct it meant, and the conduct reflected, in essence, bad faith behavior by the defendant or his attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.209" offset="6748940">When the Congress in 1966 then turned to 2244(b), it reflects in the legislative report the kind of behavior it's worried about are parties who bring identical petitions one after another, or who withhold claims, as it put it, obviously well-known to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.926" offset="7243804">There had been legislation virtually every session of Congress from 1953 through 1988 proposing habeas corpus amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.438" offset="7277867">The voices of the attorney generals and others have been quite firm in those legislative debates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.403" offset="7309737">Indeed, in 1966 there was a proposal to enact a negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.712" offset="7334919">And on the floor, the Congressional Record reflects, that... that proposal was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.930" offset="7355817">So, of course, congressional disapproval of a bill is not decisive, but seen in the context of the approval of standards that reflect and are said to reflect Sanders v.

            <text syncTime="1838.885" offset="7499595">Well, my understanding of the way the... both the substantive law works and the Rules Enabling Act works is that this Court may propose rules to Congress which Congress then accepts or rejects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.192" offset="7548809">That's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.067" offset="7552362">That dialogue took place with Rule 9(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.816" offset="7563333">A proposed rule which contained language which Congress feared might give too great a discretion to dismiss successive petitions was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.717" offset="7610981">That seems to me is the congressional response saying, no, we don't want a rule that may go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.870" offset="7631565">That's precisely what the report said in explaining the change in Rule 9(b) back to the language</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.712" offset="7658942">"or otherwise abuse of the writ. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.336" offset="7665420">So, I don't think the Court has power, if, if Congress has acted in a statutory area like habeas corpus, to disregard that rule, that standard that Congress has set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.442" offset="7713903">One can contrast this with the procedural default area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.268" offset="7729159">Where Congress is silent, where Congress has not spoken a jurisprudence can develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.563" offset="7750370">And certainly this Court has developed such a jurisprudence in cases from Davis and Francis on through Sykes and Engle v. Isaacs and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.951" offset="7783911">That's not the history of successive petition law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.013" offset="7796137">Successive petition law by contrast, by marked contrast, has had two congressional interventions in this period, and both of them reflect strong adherence to the Sanders v. United States standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.131" offset="7852561">Let me, though, move to the new law claim that is among those that our client tried to present in his first application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.409" offset="7889760">He sought to raise a claim under Estelle v. Smith, a 1981 decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.468" offset="7917972">Ms. Boleyn wants to suggest that Estelle v. Smith was foreordained, was clear to any reasonable counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.074" offset="7956424">But it's not at all clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.698" offset="7962902">It certainly wasn't in 1978 when Mr. Moore filed his first federal application, that the Fifth Amendment rights survived the guilt determination at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.022" offset="8004176">I remember being here in the Court for oral argument in 1980 when Estelle v. Smith was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.707" offset="8034896">I remember the Texas attorney general saying there simply is no right of self-incrimination left once guilt has been adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.392" offset="8065616">That was conventional wisdom in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.392" offset="8073662">Indeed, in Estelle v. Smith itself, three Justices of this Court declined to reach the Fifth Amendment ground, the self-incrimination ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.589" offset="8110442">And one, Chief Justice Rehnquist, says I'm not at all persuaded that there is a Fifth Amendment right that survives the guilt determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.197" offset="8144924">There's contemporary evidence that, that demonstrates exactly how novel that rule was at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.724" offset="8175017">Justice Kennedy may remember a case of Bauman v. United States out of the Ninth Circuit, which was a 1982 decision that came up less than a year after Estelle v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.313" offset="8221306">An Estelle claim was raised in Bauman, but the Ninth Circuit said we do not blame the district court for giving this claim short shrift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.621" offset="8262579">It arose only a month before Estelle v. Smith was decided, and until that time, until Estelle was pronounced by this Court, we know of no Supreme Court opinion or circuit court opinion that ever suggested that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights addressed in Estelle v. Smith extend past the guilt determination phase and into the sentencing phase of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.113" offset="8356516">That was a Ninth Circuit contemporaneous, if you would, witness to the novelty of Estelle v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.423" offset="8381802">The Fifth Circuit itself subsequently held, as we cited in our brief, in Gray v. Lucas that reasonable counsel in 1979, a year after Mr. Moore had filed his petition, could not have been expected to foresee a change like that in Estelle v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.806" offset="8451288">There's an additional point on Estelle, and that is that our client, Mr. Moore, is not in the shoes of Ernest Benjamin Smith himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.161" offset="8492770">It was not a psychiatric interview that Mr. Moore has challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.019" offset="8508130">Instead, he has extended Estelle v. Smith to the probation officer context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.688" offset="8530804">If Estelle itself was a surprise, was novel, we submit that the extension of Estelle to the probation officer's situation was far from clear to counsel, even reasonable counsel, other than Moore's in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.259" offset="8597156">My understanding, indeed, is this Court granted certiorari last term in Cox v. Vermont to ask and answer the question whether Estelle applies in non-capital cases to probation officer reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.863" offset="8647520">The matter is still unresolved in 1978... or 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.035" offset="8664238">Once again, Bauman held, the Ninth Circuit case, that in the probation officer setting, Estelle v. Smith didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.812" offset="8699347">Bauman also pointed out that it was a non-capital case and made some capital/non-capital distinctions which I think are quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.199" offset="8728917">But what I'm trying to do is to suggest that Estelle was far from clear in 1978 or even '80 or '81 or '82.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.585" offset="8770400">There are other cases that I could cite that express the sense of the novelty of that doctrine, but let me move on for a moment to Proffitt v. Wainwright, a second new law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.455" offset="8825884">When this case was decided by Justice Crabbage... or Judge Crabbage in the Eleventh Circuit in 1982, four years after Mr. Moore had come into federal habeas for the first time, she wrote whether the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses extends to capital sentencing proceedings has not been specifically addressed by the Supreme Court and is an issue of first impression in this circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.553" offset="8926298">Our research suggested maybe at that time, 1982, an issue of first impression everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.082" offset="8952421">The State, of course, has cited Gardner v. Florida, and said Gardner clearly presaged Proffitt v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.111" offset="8984499">We respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.657" offset="8990664">Gardner merely held that presentence reports could be made available to defense counsel for their rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.591" offset="9026504">It said nothing about whether the longstanding, widespread practice of submission of written documents at sentencing was to all of a sudden be overturned, and any defense counsel who wanted to cross-examine anyone who had filed a document as part of that report could come into court and be confronted and cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.707" offset="9110932">I'm still not sure whether Proffitt has been extended very far in, in the non-capital context to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.204" offset="9140920">We don't have very much information that I've been able to amass on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.052" offset="9556267">But he filed the petition and very shortly thereafter moved to withdraw from the case citing to the federal judge that he was overworked, that he thought that Mr. Moore's constitutional interest would suffer prejudice if he continued in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.968" offset="9615931">He then went to an evidentiary hearing so... or a status conference, so-called, during which the magistrate asked him if he wanted to put on evidence on any of the claims that were in the case, and he said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.062" offset="9772352">Although it may have been true that the 74-page report in toto was given to Mr. Pierce, the trial counsel, during the proceeding, there is no finding on whether he realized that within that report there was a five-page narrative by Officer Rachels that contained a good deal of the most damaging evidence that was submitted against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.132" offset="9864617">There is certainly no finding on whether he realized that was in the larger document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.488" offset="9890008">Indeed, he both signed affidavits and swore in state habeas corpus proceedings that he never saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.875" offset="9915608">Moreover, there's certainly no finding on whether the opportunity afforded was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.169" offset="9940790">Under federal standards, Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to hand counsel a presentence report at the very outset of the sentencing hearing would likely not be deemed reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.227" offset="9988960">And certainly our argument is under Gardner this was unreasonable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.117" offset="10004529">Whatever kind of notice it was, it wasn't sufficient notice for Mr. Pierce to have realized that his client's whole case was being jeopardized by this report because the report included, among other things, the suggestion that Mr. Moore had 10 prior crimes when in fact he had four juvenile adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.654" offset="10082687">The report suggested that the crime was a great deal more deliberate and premeditated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.528" offset="10110168">For example, it's the only document... the only evidence before the sentencing judge that Mr. Moore may have fired first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.057" offset="10140365">The sentencing report... the presentence report suggests Mr. Moore began firing four or five shots, and the victim fired in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.209" offset="10176937">Every other document and every other piece of testimony in this case is that Mr. Moore entered the bedroom window, came into the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.862" offset="10207552">The bedroom door opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.125" offset="10216538">The victim came out of the bedroom door in the dark, hit Mr. Moore on the leg with a shotgun barrel, fired the shotgun, and then Mr. Moore, who was drunk, responded by firing four or five shots from his pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.042" offset="10272231">The degree of deliberation, on the one hand, cold-bloodedly shooting this man four or five times, on the other hand, responding to his own initial shot with the shotgun is a very serious one in terms of judging the heinousness of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.288" offset="10329283">And it was the presentence report that contained that one variant account, an account that the judge apparently credited because his trial judge's report, which judges submit in Georgia at the State Supreme Court, reflected that view of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.703" offset="10382886">There are other serious errors and omissions in that presentence report as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.905" offset="10399709">Let me... let me add that the district judge who is the closest to this case and saw the facts in the greatest degree of complexity was the person who suggested that, that if Mr. Pierce had failed to see this report, an issue which he didn't pass on, as Justice Stevens points out, since he never reached the merits of the claim, he thinks that a wrongful sentence may have been imposed based on inadequate information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2694.977" offset="10924039">But the relief they received... and this is important to understand as well... was not just a resentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.569" offset="10946400">The district judge concluded on a ground subsequently overturned that Mr. Moore could not be resentenced to death because his death sentence was disproportionately excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.704" offset="10990912">Consequently, there was no point to go back, as Ms. Boleyn suggested, to start adding Estelle claims or Proffitt claims or Gardner claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.185" offset="11036783">The client at that point had a... had a ruling from a district court that full sentencing relief should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.354" offset="11065518">And, of course, that was then what was litigated up to the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.789" offset="11091222">The court of appeals said that the analysis conducted by the district court was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.942" offset="11111807">The court of appeals panel, I might add, granted relief on yet another ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.785" offset="11131242">Mr. Moore has had relief from the district court, from the circuit panel and now from the circuit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.111" offset="11152558">The court of appeals panel said a non-statutory aggravating circumstance played a major role in the sentencing judge... judge's decision, and that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.077" offset="11192369">It unfortunately gave out its ruling on June the 23rd, the same day in which this Court decided Zant v. Stephens in 1983 and said a non-statutory aggravating circumstance doesn't invalidate the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.852" offset="11243464">So, once again Mr. Moore, who had obtained relief on another ground, found himself without relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.209" offset="11264884">He pursued those matters to, to the Supreme Court, lost on certiorari, and at that point quickly came in and filed the new law claims under Estelle and Proffitt and sought a first adjudication on the merits of the Gardner claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.781" offset="11323190">The district judge denied relief on the Gardner claim, as you know, finding that it was an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.013" offset="11356104">It's a... it's a difficult finding because it's not a second adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.026" offset="11384212">But he says sufficient opportunity had earlier been afforded that he was not going to award relief or even an opportunity to be heard on the merits at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.037" offset="11424231">He didn't consider the ends of justice question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.332" offset="11437397">The court of appeals reluctantly or with some hesitation said we will not find it an abuse of your discretion, district court, to have dismissed this petition as abusive, but we do think the interests of justice call for you to give further consideration to whether you ought to reach the merits even if there's an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.605" offset="11530498">Our submission to the Court on the ends of justice point is that no matter what standards the Court majority ultimately holds meet the ends of justice test, Mr. Moore will be one of the people who falls within the core of that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.584" offset="11598416">In Kuhlmann v. Wilson, four members of the Court, as you remember, suggested that ends of justice might be best defined in terms of actual factual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.593" offset="11638436">And then in a related context in Smith v. Murray, a majority of the Court suggested that in the capital sentencing phase, the receipt of false or misleading information was sufficient to meet that related test for procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.666" offset="11702801">Well, what we have in this case is precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.353" offset="11717534">The receipt of false and misleading information by the sentencing judge upon which he relied, with the district court finding that it may well have made a life or death difference, that is within the core of the equity jurisprudence that has long marked habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.486" offset="11790050">And for that reason, we've submitted that the court of appeals was certainly right to remand this case in the interest of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.210" offset="12356907">He differed with the standard, Your Honor, because he wasn't going to say the question was whether a reasonably competent habeas attorney could have foreseen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.238" offset="12381044">What he was talking about were there the ingredients... he called them ingredients instead of tools I think... were the ingredients there to raise the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.720" offset="12410929">So, it's a difference in focus, and we're, of course, going with Judge Tjoflat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.933" offset="12459830">It's not only just the time that you're focusing on; it's a matter of perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.182" offset="12472787">In one you're talking about why was it not preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.883" offset="12487624">In another case, you're talking about why was it not presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.116" offset="12500581">And if there's, there's something that you can cite for that principle even if it's not directly on point, then it's available because you're always... the problem is you're always going to have new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.254" offset="12537152">So, if something stays in the district court long enough or in the Eleventh Circuit or another court of appeals long enough, there are going to be new decisions that you can cite for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.875" offset="12571634">So, the question is was there anything that you could use to cite the proposition in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.467" offset="12589920">And so, it's more than just the point in time... the focus... although that's the most important--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3115.761" offset="12607160">So, you say you shouldn't ask whether, whether a later decision was foreseeable, but you ask whether or not the claim should have been made?</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.742" offset="12643105">--And were there decisions then that they could use, not could they foresee the one that ultimately came, but were there decisions around them that they could use to mount the claim based on their factual situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.833" offset="12687409">So, it's other than foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.597" offset="12698484">The other thing that I'd like to point out is that I don't believe that the Sanders court could in any way envision the types of abuses of the writ that are taking place today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.890" offset="12739653">I don't believe that they could envision that piecemeal litigation would just be out... astounding in its number and in the sophisticated types of abuses of the writ that there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.872" offset="12779569">I think they viewed abuse of the writ as a very simple form more like deliberate withholding or deliberate bypass, but now we have new claims and old claims and withheld claims and bypass claims and claims based on new law and claims based on new facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.834" offset="12831396">And when you have more sophisticated types of abuses, it cries out for the interpretation of the general standard in 9(b) by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.065" offset="12864310">It's interesting to note, if we want to talk about the committee notes, that the committee's notes to Rule 9(b) say we are leaving it to the courts to interpret this standard on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of their judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.685" offset="12914778">So, Rule 9(b) itself has left it to this Court and other courts to interpret the standard because as Sanders simply says, we're not going to permit abuse and abuse is conduct that is abusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.650" offset="12958664">So, the question is what is abusive conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.553" offset="12970262">And that's why they try to get around their own abuse by talking about new law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.225" offset="12988966">That's all I have if there's no further questions.</text>
