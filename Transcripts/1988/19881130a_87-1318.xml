            <label>Mr. James E. Harrington</label>
            <text syncTime="52.245" offset="355292">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.680" offset="377025">This case concerns the effect of a contractual choice-of-law clause on federal preemption of a state statute that conflicts with the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="418821">The case presents several discrete issues that have been raised in brief by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.627" offset="440764">These issues include:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.752" offset="445257">First, the question of whether the state court of appeal was correct in construing the choice-of-law clause to exclude any application of federal law to this case and thus to shield the state statute against preemption;--</text>
            <text syncTime="88.059" offset="498547">Second, whether the choice-of-law clause should be held invalid and unenforceable as a violation of the federal public policy favoring the arbitration of private disputes in the event that the court of appeal's interpretation of the clause should be accepted;--</text>
            <text syncTime="103.473" offset="560196">And third, the question raised by Stanford's contention that the state statute at issue here would not be preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act even in the event that the contract had contained no choice-of-law clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.375" offset="615785">In addition to these three substantive issues, the case presents a... a fourth issue that was raised by the Court itself in its order postponing consideration of the question of its jurisdiction, and that issue, at least as the parties have discerned it from the Court's order, is whether the Court has jurisdiction to reexamine the court of appeal's interpretation of the choice-of-law clause or whether, on the other hand, that interpretation rests upon an adequate and independent state ground that precludes review of that issue by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.251" offset="755279">Under the rules of the Court, I am of course required to discuss the jurisdictional issue at the outset of my argument, and I will therefore proceed directly to an examination of that issue, leaving the remaining issues I've mentioned for treatment later in the course of the argument if time should still permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.479" offset="824137">Turning then to the question of jurisdiction, I would remind the Court initially that we have enumerated in our briefs no less than eight alternative reasons why this Court, indeed, possesses jurisdiction to determine the effect of the choice-of-law clause in this case and why this Court's examination of that issue is not foreclosed by an adequate and independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.423" offset="907938">I, of course, won't recapitulate all of these reasons here.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.235" offset="923194">Rather I want to emphasize only two of them that I seem to be particularly important: the first of them, because it would permit the Court to sustain its jurisdiction in this case on a particularly narrow ground, if it should so desire; and the other, because it would allow the Court to provide significant further guidance for the development of the law concerning the general question of the effect of a... of a choice-of-law clause on the scope of federal preemption and the applicability of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.597" offset="1048686">The first and probably the narrowest ground on which the Court might sustain its jurisdiction in this case is provided by the specific wording of the choice-of-law clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.216" offset="1099154">As the Court will recall, the clause provides that the contract shall be governed by</text>
            <text syncTime="244.605" offset="1124650">"the law of the place where the project is located. "</text>
            <text syncTime="248.697" offset="1141055">Since there was no extrinsic evidence in the record of what the parties meant by that phrase, the only way the phrase can be interpreted and the only way the court of appeal could, could have interpreted it is by deciding... is by determining the literal meaning of those words,</text>
            <text syncTime="287.790" offset="1297372">"law of the place where the project is located. "</text>
            <text syncTime="268.737" offset="1221199">But in order to determine the literal meaning of those words, one has to decide what law is in fact a law of the place where the project is located or, in other words, what law applies at that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.624" offset="1268741">And in this case, since the question was whether federal law in particular was encompassed within the scope of the phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="290.602" offset="1308656">one can only interpret the phrase in reference to that issue by deciding whether federal law in particular applies at that place.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="299.100" offset="1342616">But that... I don't see how that gets away from the, the idea this is basically a question of fact, what the parties meant as manifested by, by the use of the phrase you, you just said.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.500" offset="1392248">Well, it might have been a question of fact, Mr. Chief Justice, if... if there had been any evidence in the record concerning the parties' intent, but I know it's well-settled in California and presumably in the federal courts as well that where there is no extrinsic evidence bearing upon the meaning of the words in a contract, then the meaning of the contract is a question of law that the appellate court has jurisdiction to review de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.476" offset="2592209">And the issue... the issue in that case was whether a... whether the defendant had waived a federal constitutional claim by failing to raise it at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.620" offset="2864719">And since that's a federal question, the state court's ground for... or rather, the... the state court's decision was logically dependent on determination of a question of federal law and therefore could not be an adequate and independent state ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.831" offset="4761626">I think that... it's... it's... the interpretation of the choice-of-law clause will be a federal question only if the question in the case is whether that choice-of-law clause encompasses federal law or whether it precludes the application of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.807" offset="4833515">In other words, I think what we... the Court has often used the "interwoven" in its adequate and independent state ground cases, if the state ground is so interwoven with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.241" offset="4871236">I think we have a situation in here, in this case, in which the... the state ground is interwoven at both ends of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.348" offset="4907703">In the first place, my first point was that you can't really decide what the phrase means unless the initial step in your syllogism is that federal law is the law of the place where... is or isn't a law of the place where the project is located, and that's a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.935" offset="4966008">And the whole aim of the court's analysis... in between there, there's a contract interpretation, but the ultimate thing the court is after... the court of appeal... in trying to decide what this thing means, what this provision means, in relation to the application of federal law is whether federal law should be applied to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.709" offset="5033091">Sort of at both ends it's interwoven with the federal question of whether federal law applies at a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.503" offset="5060258">Now, I, I think the federal... the... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.799" offset="5077499">The Court has often stated in its decisions that the question of whether federal law applies in a particular case is, is itself a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.982" offset="5106234">And I would submit that this general principle should not be rendered any less applicable simply because the question comes presented to the Court in the guise of a contract interpretation of a choice-of-law problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.962" offset="5154090">In the first place when the so-called choice-of-law problem is a choice between the law of the United States and the law of a state, it's not the ordinary kind of choice-of-law problem, but is instead simply a, a question of federal supremacy or federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.066" offset="5210514">And I don't think the... the state courts clearly should not have the final say in resolving that kind of choice-of-law problem unless they are to be given the final say over all Supremacy Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.312" offset="5251474">And secondly, I would submit that this conclusion is not altered by the fact that the state court's choice between state and federal law may have been implemented by means of a... of an interpretation of a choice-of-law provision in a contract between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.321" offset="5319497">Although the immediate question addressed by the state court in such a case is the state law matter of interpreting a contract, the ultimate issue decided by the Court is whether federal law shall apply to the case, and that I would submit is, is a federal issue on which this Court and not the state court should have the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.688" offset="5393058">In fact, I think that any other conclusion would... would erode to a significant extent this Court's position as the, the final arbiter of all issues of preemption and of the application of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.401" offset="5451886">Choice-of-law clauses are used with increasing frequency in commercial contracts, and any... therefore, any rule that would accord the state courts final authority to determine whether such provisions foreclose the application of federal law and prevent federal preemption of state statutes would give the state courts the power of final disposition of a very large proportion of Supremacy Clause and preemption cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.277" offset="5911328">Finally, in any case I would submit whatever might be the proper disposition of this issue in the general run of cases, I... federal law should at least be deemed to govern the question whether... the question of the effect of a choice-of-law clause on the application of federal law when the state court's interpretation of the clause does not depend upon or even implicate any, any general state law principles of the law of contracts, but instead consists simply of a conclusory pronouncement that we have no doubt that a certain kind of choice-of-law clause excludes federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.230" offset="6059181">In that kind of a case at the least I would submit that the state court's so-called interpretation of the contract really amounts to nothing more than a naked declaration by the state court whether federal law shall or shall not apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.709" offset="6117068">And, and that question is certainly not one of state law, but one that this Court should have jurisdiction to review and decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.784" offset="6141414">As to the state of the, the state of the authorities on this issue, the Court has never expressly or directly addressed the question of whether federal law should, should govern the effect of a choice-of-law clause on federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.635" offset="6220826">But I think the Court has given two very strong indications in its recent decisions that this issue should, indeed, be governed by, by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.524" offset="6252382">One of these appears in the Court's recent decision in Mitsubishi Motors v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth where the Court expressly suggested that a choice-of-law clause that right preclude the application of federal law should be treated as an... as the practical equivalent of a waiver or a release of a party's federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.968" offset="6330123">And if that is so, then it would follow the interpretation of such a clause would be a federal question since the effect of a waiver or release has long been recognized as presenting a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.886" offset="6373799">More importantly, in the Court's 1982 decision in the de la Cuesta case, the Court actually decided, albeit implication... albeit by implication that the... the very issue presented in this case is, indeed, a federal question that it has jurisdiction to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.567" offset="6432523">As the Court recalls in that case, the Court undertook to interpret for itself a choice-of-law clause virtually identical to the one involved in this Volt-Stanford contract even though the state court of appeal in that case had... had previously arrived at a precisely contrary interpretation of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.326" offset="6499605">I think by undertaking to interpret that clause in that case without indicating any doubt about its jurisdiction to do so--</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.833" offset="7101571">We had a flesh and blood problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.582" offset="7116617">Volt charged that Stanford was liable because the project manager mismanaged the job and the engineer designed it badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.688" offset="7149009">Now, if Volt hurt itself... and Stanford thought it did... it ought to suffer its losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.575" offset="7172519">And if the project manager and the engineer hurt Volt, they ought to pay for its losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.010" offset="7194253">But no way, either way ought Stanford to have to pay for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.385" offset="7211808">However, if Volt's claim against Stanford were arbitrated alone, Volt might win it, and if Stanford's claim over as against the project manager and the engineer were litigated alone, they might win it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.051" offset="7262485">And so, Stanford could lose both ways with the consequence that it would have to pay for those losses it ought in no way to have to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.517" offset="7296340">And that result would be very unjust and the statute, 1281.2(c), as Justice Blackmun I believe observed, is really made for just exactly that unjust case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.409" offset="8675919">There was no extrinsic evidence offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.830" offset="8689607">It was agreed in, in essence that the contract was there to be interpreted by the court in the common sense way that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.641" offset="8724820">We argued about what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.219" offset="8731089">But one should have an... in mind that there was a factual backdrop here, and that was that the year before this contract was made, the California Court of Appeal in the Garden Grove case had interpreted essentially the same provision in essentially the same contract in essentially the same way as this Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.523" offset="8816353">And the parties, the court found, could be taken to have known about that and, therefore, to have had in mind when they struck the deal that they struck, that that's what the words meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.784" offset="8861388">So, it was not as if this was kind of out of the blue and there was no history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.063" offset="8878524">There was a clear history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.406" offset="8883853">The court of appeal was clear as to it and thought it meant something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.561" offset="8900467">Now, before I, I leave the question of jurisdiction... and I want to talk just a moment about the proposition that arbitration of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.588" offset="8952608">But before leaving the question of jurisdiction to come back at it when we get to what the contract means, I'd like to remind the Court that this purports to be a 1257(2) appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.975" offset="8994194">This is not an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.834" offset="9005584">The appellant, so he calls himself, has made it very clear to this Court that what's really on his mind is what this contract meant and why it really doesn't mean what the court found it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.485" offset="9056157">And what a contract means is not a question which goes to the validity of a statute, and consequently it does not give rise to a 1257(2) appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.386" offset="9095759">The federal question that we've got here is, is, is a question, all right, but there is nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.601" offset="9132643">There's no substance to it, and therefore it's not the kind of question that this Court ought to review under its certiorari jurisdiction, and the case simply ought to go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.301" offset="9175484">Now, just a... just a few words more about the proposition that arbitration is a matter of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.750" offset="9201293">Nothing in the FAA obviously changes that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.311" offset="9223550">The FAA puts arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts but not more so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.247" offset="9247269">It's meant to enforce parties' agreements according to their terms, whatever their terms are, no less but no more than they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.681" offset="9281019">And those are familiar principles to the Court, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.256" offset="9295334">Every case from Prima Paint through Perry says exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.801" offset="9309440">No case says otherwise, and Dean Witter sums it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.379" offset="9323755">That's the preeminent purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.580" offset="9332532">The Act does not mandate people to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.720" offset="9345176">It just says that it wants to enforce agreements that parties have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.937" offset="9365969">And the liberal policy favoring arbitration that Mr. Harrington referred to is, as the Mitsubishi case puts it, just at bottom a policy guaranteeing the enforcement of private agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.746" offset="9413199">This, this court... this court simply interpreted the parties' agreement in accordance with its terms, exactly what it ought to have done under this court's principles of law, exactly what the letter and the spirit of the FAA command, and there's simply nothing to argue about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.409" offset="9495850">And finally, as to that point, they proved it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.424" offset="9507971">They proved it in their brief, but they proved it again today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.752" offset="9517270">The question was put to Mr. Harrington, look, if the parties had clearly agreed to be bound by state law, would that be okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.546" offset="9548408">And he said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.873" offset="9557708">In their brief they said, you know, you could have accomplished what you say you accomplished longhand just by in so many words setting forth 1281.2(c), but you didn't do that, and in the process proving again that there's simply nothing of substance at issue here because if you can achieve the goal longhand, what earthly difference does it make whether you achieve it, as we did, shorthand?</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.953" offset="11286074">And if there were that going on here, I think the answer to Your Honor's question would be, yes, you could call a halt to it, blow a whistle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.042" offset="11322436">But there's nothing like that remotely that went on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.807" offset="11337483">Really all that happened was that against a backdrop of commonly looked-to California rules of how you interpret contracts, the court interpreted a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.926" offset="11401953">And the common rule is... the very common sense rule... that words are to be interpreted in accordance with their popular meaning not in their strict legal sense, and they are supposed to be interpreted in accordance with local usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.419" offset="11455974">Obviously, that's the way things ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.622" offset="11464751">I mean, there's no sense interpreting words used one place the way they're used some other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.402" offset="11483873">And so, the court against that backdrop simply interpreted the common sense word "place" before it and reached the judgment that, you know, place where the project is located means California, the place where the project is located, a matter which really ought not to have to occupy this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.221" offset="11559105">Really what the words, you know, seem naturally to say... a long list of federal statutes that use them in essentially the same way, and that case, Garden Grove, that I referred to earlier had interpreted them exactly the same way the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.310" offset="11619501">Now, when you come down to it, it seems to us a very telling point here, it has to do with what it is that they are asking you to do in respect to this kind of earthy little state law question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.145" offset="11698808">I mean, what really are they asking you to do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.316" offset="11711556">To reinterpret the choice-of-law clause in this private contract, hold that the words mean what Volt says they mean in this private contract, in all private contracts in California and everywhere else, hold that because that's the ordinary meaning of the words in California or everywhere else, hold that whether that's the ordinary meaning of the words in California or anywhere else?</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.180" offset="11806955">And it really would be unprincipled for the Court to undertake to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.022" offset="11834332">There obvious is none that says that you're supposed to interpret popular words in an unpopular way, and there's nothing before the Court to suggest to it that people have ever used the words that were used here in the way that Volt says they were used here in the entire history of the State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.373" offset="13871778">A state statute which states that an arbitration agreement shall not be enforced at all in certain circumstances is not a procedural provision; it's a substantive obstacle to arbitration of precisely the same kind that was held preempted by this Court in Southland and Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.600" offset="13932696">And that's what this state statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.429" offset="13940010">It says you can't enforce arbitration at all in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.381" offset="13951817">Second point, Mr. Heilbron has made much of what the parties agreed to, but it's clear what the parties agreed to in this content... in this context in any ordinary layman sense was to agree to arbitrate their disputes with no exceptions, qualifications, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.798" offset="14017437">All disputes are to be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.591" offset="14024647">The... this, this clause was custom-crafted by Stanford with... with a clear awareness of this very situation involving third-party disputes in mind and yet it was drafted in such a way that the duty to arbitrate would remain intact in that situation though Stanford had the opportunity, which was taken by the parties in the Garden Grove case Mr. Heilbron referred to, to exempt themselves from arbitration if there were third party disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.550" offset="14128510">That wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.049" offset="14130495">The parties deliberately agreed to arbitrate in that situation.</text>
