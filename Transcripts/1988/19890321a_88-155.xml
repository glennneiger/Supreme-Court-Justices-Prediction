            <text syncTime="14.074" offset="198590">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.312" offset="219592">The issue before this Court is whether the public burning of an American flag which occurred as part of a demonstration with political overtones is entitled to First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.202" offset="267135">The flag burning in this case occurred during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.673" offset="293048">The flag was burning in front of Dallas City Hall at the culmination of a demonstration march through downtown Dallas in the midst of a crowd of demonstrators and on lookers.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.147" offset="334949">The flag burner, who was identified as Mr. Johnson, was convicted under a Texas statute which prohibits desecration of the national flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.920" offset="374028">His punishment was assessed at one year in the county jail plus a $2,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.006" offset="394299">The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the Intermediate Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.792" offset="413525">Mr. Johnson then filed petition for discretionary review to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.246" offset="435259">That is the highest court in the state of Texas which hears criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="451664">The court granted his petition, reversed his conviction, and ordered the information dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.337" offset="479667">The Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Texas statute was unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Johnson, since he was a political protester.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.145" offset="522926">Judge Campbell of that court found that flag burning constituted symbolic speech within the test enunciated by this court in Spence versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="562945">That court also found that Texas' asserted interests in regulating the act of flag burning were insufficient to outweigh a protestor's First Amendment rights to expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.141" offset="610906">For purposes of this argument today and with the Court's indulgence, the state will assume the symbolic speech standard and proceed directly to the question of Texas' compelling interest in regulating this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.420" offset="676003">Throughout the course of the appellate history in this case Texas has advanced two compelling state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.241" offset="703275">One is the preservation of the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.060" offset="726576">The second is the preservation of a breach of the peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.589" offset="904627">His actions would have been useless unless the flag was a very good symbol for what he intended to show contempt for.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.245" offset="1031269">I... I mean, it seems to me you're running quite a different argument, not that he's destroying its symbolic character, but that he is showing disrespect for it, that you not just want a symbol, but you want a venerated symbol, and you don't make that argument because then you're getting into... into a sort of content preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.974" offset="1114234">But I don't see how you can argue that he's making it any less of a symbol than it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.818" offset="1585587">And that is really all Texas is suggesting with this is that we have got to preserve the symbol by preserving the flag itself because there really is no other way to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.172" offset="5406988">The appropriate test to be utilized in this area has not been decided by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.761" offset="5437394">There are two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.163" offset="5447007">One is that public desecration of a flag is inherently inflammatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.139" offset="5506880">And, again, the goal is a prevention of a breach of the peace, not a punishment for a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.143" offset="5538854">And in analyzing this particular statute, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals utilized a much higher standard than any court has ever used before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.332" offset="5575634">They went to an actual breach of the peace and they said well, there was no actual breach of the peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.902" offset="5609907">Individuals who were seriously offended by this conduct were not moved to violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.758" offset="5645329">But I don't believe that that is dispositive of the state's interest and because its interest is different, the standard is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.982" offset="5682214">And I believe that the Court of Criminal Appeals suggestions in this regard are a bit too narrow; that if you have to show an actual breach of the peace, your purpose in a flag desecration statute is obviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.509" offset="5744385">Some other statute would serve that interest, but not a flag desecration standard because its purpose is prevention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.850" offset="6309675">Some of the steam has been taken out of me by some of the questions and some of the responses and the concession by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.488" offset="6336320">But I would like to suggest briefly to state that this particular act that we're concerned with here, this 42.09(a)(3) of the Texas statute singles out communicative impact for punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.281" offset="6395461">Now, Ms. Drew has avoided that by now... and virtually the state now apparently concedes that you can write out of a statute what Justice O'Connor referred to, the question of whether the actor knows or means that what he's doing will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or destroy or discover his particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.330" offset="6499638">That's out of the statute, apparently, according to the argument because in the reply brief and today she has said essentially what is in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.871" offset="6537776">Like Gertrude Stein, "A rose is a rose", they now say</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.156" offset="6554913">"A flag burning is a flag burning. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.192" offset="6563063">And they read out of the statute under which he was convicted and which went to the jury and the charge on the question of seriously offend, that's all out as far as Ms. Drew is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.666" offset="6609038">But it's not out as far as this court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.718" offset="6621159">That's what the conviction was about, that's what the argument to the jury was about, that's what the charge was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.438" offset="6648118">They all mention that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.521" offset="6652402">That's what the witnesses, Stover, Tucker, and Walker, testified to, that they were seriously offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.711" offset="6677166">So, this depends on communicative impact for punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.913" offset="6693989">They've conceded it's pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.115" offset="6702766">They raise no question arguendo, even, essentially that it is not speech, and concede that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.339" offset="7375680">That's the contemptuous treatment statute, and that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.307" offset="7391563">Everything depends on the communication that is made by the actor which may be communicated to the people on the street, but you know in the statute, Justice Scalia, it goes even further, "likely to observe or discover", which could be in the newspapers the next day, for example, as well as being an onlooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.989" offset="7482260">So, I think that given the concession that the statute is pure speech, given the past decisions of this Court on what should happen to a statute that makes communicative impact, the criterion of the punishment that this statute fails that test, it certainly doesn't come under O'Brien because where... here the government's interest is directly related to expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.824" offset="7589571">It's like Footnote 8 in Spence, and I think what you have here is a statute that depends solely and exclusively on communicative impact on the audience, whether they're there or they read it in the newspaper or they see it on the screen in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.351" offset="7655713">It all goes to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.318" offset="7659579">And when you use the word desecrate, you don't mean really in essence praising the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.422" offset="7688000">Desecrate has a... has a... has a meaning, and I just looked at it in Webster's Second International about it, and desecrate means to divest of a sacred character or office, to divert from a sacred purpose, to violate the sanctity of, to profane, the opposite of consecrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.603" offset="7768771">Now, with reference to the compelling state interest, I listened to the argument of flower to star against B.J.F. before here, and I don't want to hurt Mr. Rahdert's argument in this argument, knowing nothing about the case except what I heard today, but I thought that the protection of a rape victim was a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.682" offset="7849019">I agreed with Justice O'Connor's comments on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.753" offset="8377319">But in so deciding in relying on Barnette, the court said, essentially I thought, that it was an illegitimate interest in Street to compel respect by prohibiting criticism of the flag, including flag burning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.854" offset="11249744">"This statute is so broad that it may be used to punish protected conduct which has no propensity to result in breaches of the peace. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.925" offset="11278061">Serious offense does not always result in a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.743" offset="11293316">The protest in this case did not lead to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.429" offset="11304078">And, I might add, in this protest they had policemen right along with them, undercover police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.131" offset="11322887">The crowd was not a large crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.183" offset="11331037">They estimate between 100, 110, and Texas went on to say, as with most other protests of this nature, police were present at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.438" offset="11368026">A witness was obviously seriously offended by appellant's conduct because he gathered the burned flag and buried it at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.508" offset="11396343">Nevertheless so seriously offended, this man was not moved to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.412" offset="11415987">Serious offense occurred, but there was no breach of the peace, nor does the record reflect that the situation was potentially explosive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.650" offset="11444931">One cannot equate serious offense with incitement to breach the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.237" offset="11463321">And I think that any breach of the peace argument here falls on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.141" offset="11486936">It is... I think when Chief Justice Burger said in O'Brien versus Skinner,</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.693" offset="11505117">"It is not our function to construe... to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.513" offset="11536359">They have construed this statue with reference certainly to breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.000" offset="11558302">On vagueness and overbreadth, I think the vagueness is... is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.420" offset="11584007">It's... by definition it's vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.272" offset="11591425">What does "serious offense" mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.724" offset="11601247">What is "unserious offense" as against "serious offense"?</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.276" offset="11615458">Some of the ACLU witnesses here testified here they were offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.995" offset="11630296">They thought it was repulsive, one of them said, but they were not seriously offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.216" offset="11647223">And I don't know what seriously offended means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.151" offset="11658926">The state says it's in the dictionary, and therefore it must have a meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.520" offset="11672405">I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.720" offset="11677212">Every word is in the dictionary, or at least in some dictionaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.738" offset="11689228">But just because they're in the dictionary doesn't mean that you can define legally or on the spot what serious offense is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.677" offset="11725068">It wasn't a serious offense, for example, to fly the flag outside the Supreme Court in violation of 36 USC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.183" offset="11759027">The artists' amicus brief, which I think is a most unusual brief, contains many, many of the artists' paintings where you might say that they created paintings that would seriously offend by manipulating the American flag or by cutting it up, destroying it, using it in different ways, many of them to protest situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.882" offset="11849829">Some of them go to the war in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.749" offset="11857352">Some of them go to other aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.916" offset="11866025">You don't even know what physical mistreatment means in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.052" offset="11878563">Does physical mistreatment mean wearing it, twisting it, burning it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.206" offset="11907194">It's just an undefinable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.341" offset="11923703">As far as overbreadth is concerned and even taking into consideration Justice White's substantial overbreadth argument, this is substantially overbroad--</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.658" offset="12024954">It sweeps protected conduct under its aegis and is... it's just an overbroad statute, so overbroad that I don't think anyone can really doubt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.584" offset="12084617">And, in fact, there's been no real argument against it, against the overbreadth argument essentially the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.036" offset="12710511">I would just like to end my argument... I think this is a fundamental First Amendment case, that the First Amendment to the written Constitution is in jeopardy by statutes like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.344" offset="12759726">And I wanted to essentially close with two remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.146" offset="12778952">One Justice Jackson said in Barnette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.416" offset="12795984">"Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves eliminating dissenters. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.524" offset="12840392">"The First Amendment was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.280" offset="12875396">And I think that's an important statement over the years from Justice Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.284" offset="12899429">And then he goes... in just a recent article in the New York Times called</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.421" offset="12923984">"In Chicago a Holy War Over the Flag. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.122" offset="12934851">by J. Anthony Lukas, a very excellent former reporter for the New York Times, he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.758" offset="12953345">"Whatever pain freedom of expression may inflict, it is a principle on which we can give no ground. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.895" offset="12977901">And I understand that this flag has serious important meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.049" offset="12998485">The Chief has mentioned many times that it is not just pieces of material, blue and white and red.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.886" offset="13025861">That has real meaning to real people out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.088" offset="13038714">But that does not mean that it may have different meanings to other people out there and that they may not under the First Amendment show their feelings by what Texas calls desecration of a venerated object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.200" offset="13107154">I think it's a most important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.401" offset="13115932">I sense that it goes to the heart of the First Amendment, to hear things or to see things that we hate test the First Amendment more than seeing or hearing things that we like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.293" offset="13163474">It wasn't designed for things we like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.161" offset="13174968">They never needed a First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.030" offset="13182492">This statute or this amendment was designed so that the things we hate, Terminiello's remarks, burnings of flags, or what have you can have a place in the marketplace of ideas and can have an area where protest can find itself, I submit that this Court should on whatever ground it feels right, should affirm the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals with reference to this statute and this conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.740" offset="13353332">One or two points very, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.742" offset="13365244">There is absolutely nothing in the information that was filed or in the jury charge that was submitted to the court which would have authorized a conviction for any words that had been spoken by Mr. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.967" offset="13414145">It is true that the trial prosecutor did make about half a page in his 20 page summation to the jury, a reference to the law of parties because an individual for a criminal offense in Texas can be held liable as a party if certain factors are shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.928" offset="13486034">And I think that was incumbent upon him, but there is absolutely nothing that would have authorized a conviction for any words that were spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.553" offset="13528562">I also fall to see how, if I understand Mr. Kunstler's concession, If one can protect government flags why one cannot protect a flag which is not necessarily the property of the government because the danger of a breach of the peace is the same and the denigration to the symbol is the same.</text>
