            <text syncTime="60.140" offset="387289">As to obscenity, which is not protected by the First Amendment, the short answer to Sable's objections, concerning how the statute is to be applied, is that they are insufficient to support a facial challenge, because the statute plainly is capable of constitutional application.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.271" offset="451759">As to indecency, the statute is justified by a distinctive combination of factors similar to those relied on in the broadcasting context in Pacifica: the accessibility of the telephone medium to children, the compelling governmental interest in preventing children, especially younger children, from hearing patently offensive sexual speech, especially in the privacy of the home, the reasonable congressional judgment that no lesser measure would reliably prevent children's access, and the availability of alternative sources of such speech for adults who wish to obtain it.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.126" offset="1667184">The providers of this so-called dial-a-porn use the telephone companies to do their billing.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.712" offset="1881597">I know of no state which... in which a telephone company has refused to accept these, and has been upheld in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.039" offset="1914825">From the beginning of this new industry it was clear that children had ready access to dial-a-porn, and that the messages contained a wide range of graphic descriptions of sexual acts, many of those acts involving minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.038" offset="1970831">In 1983 Congress enacted the first version of section 223(b) to attack the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.972" offset="2002596">The statute banned obscene and indecent commercial telephone communications to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.495" offset="2024644">It directed the FCC to devise regulations that would try to separate adults from minors in the calling audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.582" offset="2061006">And it provided that compliance with such regulations would be a defense under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.467" offset="2080546">The FCC then undertook a four-year effort to promulgate regulations that would accommodate Congress' competing goals, to try to prevent access by minors while not unduly restricting adults' access to dial-a-porn.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.064" offset="2134985">The Commission first proposed a defense based either on use of a credit card to pay for the call, which was not feasible for pre-recorded telephone messages, or on restriction of the messages to evening and... and night-time hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.615" offset="2197156">In the challenge brought by Sable's affiliate, Carlin, the Second Circuit invalidated the time-of-day restriction as essentially ineffective, noting how little time it took for a minor to make a call, and the availability of dial-a-porn by long-distance calls to other time zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.905" offset="2262358">On remand the Commission added a second defense based on the dial-a-porn providers requiring callers to punch in an access code to hear the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.411" offset="2300392">Based on comments from Carlin and others, Carlin, in fact, stated children intent on acquiring a code will certainly be able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.546" offset="2332889">The Commission recognized the problem that minors might obtain access codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.570" offset="2348980">And the Commission, therefore, required that access codes be made available only through the mail and cancelled upon notification of improper use.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.346" offset="2384089">In the same proceeding, the Commission also rejected various kinds of blocking as technologically infeasible, unduly expensive, over-inclusive in their impact on non-sexual 976 telephone messages, and ineffective in preventing minors' access.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.366" offset="2452216">After another court challenge by Sable's affiliate and another remand from that challenge, the Commission promulgated a third set of regulations, adding a third defense based on the providers scrambling of its messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.424" offset="2508431">Once scrambled, the message could be de-scrambled by a simple $15 to $20, pocketwatch-size device held up to or attached to the earpiece on the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.903" offset="2550332">Again, based on comments submitted in the administrative proceeding and reiterated by Sable in its challenge in the Second Circuit, the Commission recognized that minors might be able to obtain de-scramblers, as it previously recognized with respect to access codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.853" offset="2618146">In the end, though, the Commission came to rest on the three defenses, requiring credit card payment, access codes or scrambling, as the best, available implementation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.585" offset="6633062">Let me begin with the question that you, Mr. Chief Justice, asked Mr. Taranto, and with Justice Scalla's follow-up concern, because, until now, this case has been litigated in terms of the interest of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.943" offset="6682485">But I do understand the question, mightn't Congress have had... or mightn't this Court in hindsight attribute to Congress, another legitimate purpose, protecting common carriers from the distasteful obligation of carrying messages that, in some cases, as Justice Scalia suggests, are just short of obscene, although in other cases, as with many of the portions of the Carlin tape, are probably far short of obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.771" offset="6797737">That interest is an important one, I think, to examine, even if Congress didn't have it in mind, though I wouldn't concede that it would be appropriate to hold the law on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.818" offset="6830025">The fact is that most courts have not treated telephone companies in this context as common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.153" offset="6855311">Pacific Bell has debated whether it will carry these messages; for the time being, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.456" offset="6880493">Mountain State said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.097" offset="6887076">And the Ninth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Sneed, in Carlin Communication against Mountain State, said that when you have these messages that can reach lots of people at once, the phone company doesn't have to be treated as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.098" offset="6935142">It declined to construe state law as requiring that pornographic messages, even lawful ones, be carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.372" offset="6964190">Southern Bell similarly refused, and the Fifth Circuit said that it didn't have to carry them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.604" offset="6985088">And both Circuits said there was no state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.487" offset="6992611">So the premise that Mr. Taranto has, that perhaps Congress might be upheld on another ground, I think just can't be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.187" offset="7875445">With respect to children, I think the important and quite universally recognized point, and we certainly have to concede it, is that when a category of speech is protected for adults but might harm children, there are not may ways that government can absolutely rule out any possible child access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.302" offset="7959873">There are three broad approaches government can take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.812" offset="7969904">It can try to channel or zone the speech into times and places where parents can supervise exposure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.191" offset="8147432">Now, a second approach is to screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.184" offset="8155478">That is, one can require that the speech, which is unsuitable for children, be coded or scrambled, or otherwise made accessible only to people who have some special information or device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.222" offset="8211589">And then one can make it illegal for minors to obtain that device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.945" offset="8226531">You could require lockboxes on cable t.v., and, of course, there is the FCC's 1987 approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.100" offset="9523145">Certainly, as a less restrictive alternative than a flat ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.101" offset="9535057">It agrees that they are legitimate unless and until a less restrictive alternative, still, becomes available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.525" offset="9560761">But certainly, their availability makes this flat ban illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.560" offset="9576957">Let me return to Justice Scalla's question about the terrible... the rape of that 12-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.635" offset="9605274">Some of the stuff, which is either obscene or not obscene, in any medium, night be associated with terrible, terrible tragedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.113" offset="9651145">That isn't, I think, denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.424" offset="9660444">The question really is can one, as a result, in dealing with non-obscene material which the government admits is protected for adults, wipe it out from the whole medium on the theory that it's somehow distinctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.223" offset="9719586">The fact is, if you can do it to the telephone, you can do it to pictures of nudity or violence that are not suitable for minors, that might give them terrible ideas, but that are protected for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.003" offset="9778727">They can be every bit as tempting and corrupting for children, both in print and on film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.049" offset="9802864">There are other suggestions the government makes for somehow trying to limit the precedent that think it realizes could be terribly dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.973" offset="9838600">They suggest repeatedly in their brief that what's distinctive about the phone in your home, to which you referred, Justice Scalla, is that it is somehow immune to control for age at the point of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.053" offset="9898890">That is, unlike the neighborhood magazine store or the neighborhood movie theater, where there is somebody in the window and where, unless you're pretty close to 18, you can't very well pass for 18, though you can sneak in, the government says that there's no live vendor at the telephone, and therefore no check at the point of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.817" offset="9981960">And therefore, it's distinctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.570" offset="9988960">And we could, therefore, justify a sort of limited ruling saying that on the telephone you can reduce adults to what is suitable for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.555" offset="10016964">I think that that's quite a canard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.828" offset="10030025">I mean, the fact is that the FCC's safeguards, the combination of requiring a credit card or an access code, or scrambling the message, would interpose live vendors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.727" offset="10089584">When you go to get the credit card or the access code or the de-scrambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.680" offset="10101391">The picture of the world that is painted by the government in its brief is that these children are so enterprising they can steal their parents' credit cards, they can sneak into someplace and buy this de-scrambling device, but somehow, despite that, they're not going to manage to see the same thing on adult... in adult magazines or somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.495" offset="10196686">The fact is you have to buy an adult magazine even to get the telephone number of one of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.809" offset="10217897">So the idea that the absence of a live vendor is decisive, I think, is fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.561" offset="10240990">It's especially fallacious since the government's own argument shows that the harm comes not from the purchase, but from the peek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.447" offset="10268471">The harm is exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.447" offset="10276516">It doesn't matters who bought it, if the child goes across the street and looks at the centerfold at the age of five or six, or reads some dirty jokes, that can be disruptive of development in exactly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.897" offset="10330329">The issue, therefore, has nothing to do with the vendor, it has to do with the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.769" offset="10345793">And are we going to have government, basically, displace parents, because parents are not... are not perfect?</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.356" offset="13836170">Just a couple of brief points that I think focus on the heart of... of our dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.431" offset="13868457">First of all, it cannot be consistent with what this Court held in Ginsberg and reiterated in Pacifica, that the point of sale is simply irrelevant to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.269" offset="13911821">If congressional and state legislative-concern ended with the proposition that minors can through a variety of means, pick up copies of Playboy Magazine in their friends' houses, or what have you then the whole proposition and ruling of Ginsberg would be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.751" offset="13989666">The point of... the significance of the point of sale is that it represents, in most cases, a very reliable opportunity to make sure that minors are screened from the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.841" offset="14042015">What is distinctive about the telephone mediums as was distinctive about the broadcasting mediums is that that is simply not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.137" offset="14075243">One... one additional point, and that is, we think it is, at the very least, Important in focusing, then, on whether Congress did adopt the less restrictive alternative, in addition to giving deference to Congress' and the Commission's judgement about precisely what kind of access children would have, to ensure that... that we don't... that the Court does not strike down a ban on the strength o a less restrictive alternative that the Second Circuit found unconstitutional in Carlin III, and that Sable, itself, would continue to challenge as unconstitutional.</text>
