            <text syncTime="70.698" offset="421775">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.408" offset="436613">In the Customs program at issue today, large numbers of innocent people are subjected to what they regard as a degrading and embarrassing search of their urine when the government has no reason to believe that they are guilty of any drug use and when the government admits that it does not expect to find significant evidence of such misconduct in these searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.604" offset="529400">We will argue, therefore, that these suspicionless searches are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.778" offset="554059">I'd like to consider first today the government's justification for this search because under any analysis the Court may employ, the government must have a need to intrude upon the privacy of its citizens, even its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.911" offset="622605">And if that need does not exist, if it is not... if the search is not justified, even a minor intrusion cannot be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.078" offset="667326">Therefore, the... the government argues that this is a minor intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.201" offset="679761">I would like to... to address the intrusion question second.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.274" offset="696061">Now, the government recites an interest in this case in a drug-free work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.439" offset="720721">But on this record, as we will show, that interest is already met and it is not threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.183" offset="751754">And in that event, the government has failed to establish any need to undertake new and intrusive searches beyond the many tools it already possesses, let alone searches without any individualized suspicion whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.993" offset="806925">May I turn then to what the record actually shows about the origins of this program?</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.063" offset="6055238">It... it has to do with both the process of collecting the sample, which we have outlined in our brief, and with the... the laboratory analysis itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.308" offset="6096198">And recalling that these are good employees, they... they must report to what we have come to call a collection site to give a urine sample in a highly controlled atmosphere closely monitored by a collection site person who has no training or experience in particular whose sole purpose is to prevent cheating and to preserve the chain of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.375" offset="6192433">Usually the employee is not directly watched while urinating, but he may be under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.708" offset="6213854">But he must be closely listened to and in all other ways closely observed for signs of unusual or suspicious behavior which is noted in a permanent book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.197" offset="6259725">The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis to detect the presence of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.848" offset="6282399">And I have to mention that every single one of these specified drugs but one has licit uses as well as illicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.115" offset="6319388">Every single one but one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.048" offset="6327121">And all of those legitimate therapeutic uses will have... will be discovered by this test and will have to be justified to a representative of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.866" offset="6374455">So, those employees who take medication for certain kinds of pain, certain kinds of depression, narcolepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic cough, maybe even some cancer treatments, will have to justify their use of these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.996" offset="6450941">Now, the Fourth Amendment protects various interests, among them privacy, bodily integrity and dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.203" offset="6487826">And I think each of those is seriously transgressed by this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.376" offset="6504440">It is a personal search of the contents of one's bladder.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1699.035" offset="6935147">Thank you, Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.361" offset="6968375">The Fourth Amendment says that the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.140" offset="7011529">Our principal contention here is that what the Customs Service has done is entirely reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.443" offset="7040786">Let me focus in a little bit more on the... on the program we have, and I think it's very well described in Petitioners' amici, the AF of L-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.970" offset="7086866">On page 4 of their brief, the AF of L-CIO writes, this program</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.263" offset="7104002">"applies only to a self-selected subgroup of employees: those who voluntarily apply for a promotion to a new job for which some inquiry into the employees' fitness for duty must be conducted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.044" offset="7163144">And then a footnote goes on to say:</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.413" offset="7168577">"Indeed, of these applicants, only those who are tentatively selected for promotion are required to undergo the test, and before being so required these individuals are permitted to withdraw. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.451" offset="7216747">I would only add that if they do withdraw, this has no employment consequences and they are free to reapply at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.899" offset="7258543">It seems to us that this program so described is a very long way from what the Fourth Amendment was originally intended to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.997" offset="7310997">Nevertheless... nevertheless... over the years and through many decisions of this Court, it's quite clear that government programs that implicate privacy and dignitary interests of the individual come within the gravitational force of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.540" offset="7381109">And we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.120" offset="7387483">What's also clear, however, is that the further you come from the central case of an abrupt, coercive intrusion upon the individual in a criminal context, the less appropriate it is to think in terms of probable cause and the warrant and the more we're thrown back on the overarching test of reasonableness which the amendment itself specifically sets forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.091" offset="7515379">Now, that reasonableness is the product of a balance, a balance of the seriousness of the government's interest, on one hand, and the intrusion on the individual, its nature, its context, its timing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.044" offset="7591134">Is one element in the balance the probability that some useful information will be discovered?</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.547" offset="7613181">When we talk in... in the normal warrant case probable cause to find something or... is that an element in the balance?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1874.802" offset="7638154">It is an element in the balance, and I think that's an important point to talk about because it's hard to argue... and nobody seriously argues... that the government does not have a very serious interest in assuring that those who are on the front line of drug interception are not themselves involved in drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.774" offset="7718089">And that does not mean just on the job, but the weekend before or the week before or the month before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.359" offset="7744420">That's quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.671" offset="7749645">What is urged against this program and what is said to argue against its reasonableness is that this is not as effective as it might be in weeding out drug users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.441" offset="7808786">But that seems to us a rather curious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.465" offset="7824877">We are told that it's possible to defeat the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.455" offset="7840760">All you have to do is abstain from drugs for a period of from five days to... we heard Mr. Mann say in the previous case... up to 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.283" offset="7888094">Now it seems to us that the very indefiniteness of that time horizon is going to have an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.399" offset="7916619">It will deter persons from applying for the job because they can't be sure if they have been involved in a drug, that they're going to be drug-free.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.816" offset="7970223">We're talking about a group of people who have a track record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.269" offset="7984015">And as your brief points out, they have a 50 to 67 percent capacity under drugs and they have absenteeism and all the rest of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.778" offset="10422076">Judge Gezell noted in a case involving random drug testing of air traffic controllers that this program was designed to somehow accommodate and acknowledge these dignitary concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.666" offset="10485606">At first it was thought that the collection would take place under direct observation, and as a result of hearing exactly the kind of objections which Ms. Williams eloquently put forward, the government stepped back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.317" offset="10540254">It averted its eyes, as it were, and said, no, there will not be direct observation unless there's some reason to believe that something unusual is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.574" offset="10577243">Now, it seems to me that that very stepping back is exactly the kind of acknowledgement that there is a privacy concern which should go a long way to assuage the sense that something unpleasant is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.414" offset="10644639">There... you go into a stall, and that... it's an area which is designated to be private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.437" offset="10672747">Now, it's not the most private thing in the world, but it is more private than it might have been, and it is made private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.632" offset="10697511">There is a kind of a tip of the hat to the proposition that, look, we understand this might be embarrassing, and we're trying to acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.949" offset="10730739">And that goes I think a long way to saying we're not going to just run roughshod over you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.273" offset="10756025">We understand this is disturbing and we try to accommodate to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.495" offset="10776923">Then finally, there is an objection to the search of the specimen itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.029" offset="10807121">We see in the briefs the phrase that this is a periscope into the private lives and off-duty behavior of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.216" offset="10843797">Now, that's a striking metaphor, but it's both misleading and fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.151" offset="10863545">The tests are designed to come up with only one thing: evidence of controlled substance use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.397" offset="10904610">It will not show any other kind of substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.050" offset="10919134">That's the first thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.892" offset="10922582">Second, of course, many of those substances might be used for legitimate purposes under a doctor's prescription, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.478" offset="10952884">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.028" offset="10959049">The information that you give the test persons about that is something which, if you... if you wish, you may withhold until the time that you meet the medical review officer, and you may at that time say, well, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.408" offset="11028639">It's come up positive for opiates, but I am taking cough medicines of that sort, and here's the doctor's prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.806" offset="11062180">And that information, unless the MRO concludes that it's not true or that you are a drug user... that information stops there at the medical review officer's desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.993" offset="11106902">It does not get to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.114" offset="11115470">And therefore, this periscope is designed to allow the employer to see only one thing: illegal drug use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.821" offset="11154236">And we suggest that the employer is entitled to inquire into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.352" offset="11172417">They inquire of the person under penalties of perjury, of his neighbors, of his family, and we think may also inquire of a urine sample.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.904" offset="11490588">And then there's the random kind of testing, and that case is not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.776" offset="11510128">We think it's very important that, though inevitably you will deal in categories of cases, that the Court consider the kind of case that it actually has with the kind of record and the kind of justification that is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.348" offset="11572404">If we have a case in which a much larger population is tested or where the method is random drug testing, then I would hope the Court will consider that case on the record that will then be established after it has been sorted over and digested by courts below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.009" offset="12983016">Will I be able to do what is required of me at this test, how will I feel about it, what if a mistake is made, are entirely reasonable apprehensions that everyone facing this test must have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.336" offset="13036306">Now, I would like to say in closing that, of course, the employer is entitled to inquire about all sorts of things when one applies for this kind of job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.275" offset="13080087">The question is saying that I have an interest in whether or not you ever used drugs... does that give me the right to conduct searches to find out whether you are telling me the truth?</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.956" offset="13162843">We can take no risk at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.668" offset="13169635">The margin for error built into an individualized suspicion requirement is unacceptable in... in the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.446" offset="13216760">The margin of error is unacceptable or singularly unsuited, as I believe the brief says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.660" offset="13237658">But that is a judgment we are not free to make today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.463" offset="13252809">We are no... we cannot say that we can no longer afford the margin of error that is built into the Fourth Amendment.</text>
