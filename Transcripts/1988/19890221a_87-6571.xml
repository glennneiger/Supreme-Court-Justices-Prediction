            <text syncTime="12.241" offset="196235">Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.941" offset="199056">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="208983">On November 12, 1984, Dethorne Graham was not a convict or a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.263" offset="232284">He was not a pretrial detainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.131" offset="243778">Indeed, he was not even a formal arrestee.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.567" offset="257571">He was a free citizen of the United States of America who on that day had an insulin reaction, and he called upon a friend to take him to a convenience store where he could purchase some orange juice to help counteract the effect of the insulin reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.343" offset="320683">Upon arriving there, he noted that because of a line it would take him a long time to get his orange juice, and he became concerned and ran to his friend's car and motioned for him to take him to his girlfriend's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.103" offset="379719">A Charlotte, North Carolina police officer saw him hurriedly exit the convenience store and determined the conditions to be suspicious enough to allow for a brief investigative stop to determine the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="433009">Upon making this stop, Mr. Berry immediately informed Officer Connor that Mr. Graham was indeed suffering from what he described as a sugar reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.754" offset="482328">At this time Officer Connor asked Mr. Berry, or told Mr. Berry, that he must remain with Mr. Graham at that time while he determined what happened at the convenience store, and he began to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.512" offset="529349">At this time the Petitioner became concerned, and according to his testimony he has little memory of what occurred, most likely because of the continuation of his insulin reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.250" offset="568323">He exited the car and ran around it twice, and then sat down on the curb.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.921" offset="594968">From this point forward, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Petitioner, as must be done on a directed verdict, he was seated at that time, again peacefully talking with the police officers when back-up officers arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.266" offset="656304">We know that those officers must have been told of the alleged sugar reaction before the first comment.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Gerald Beaver</label>
            <text syncTime="149.696" offset="746061">He was talking to Mr. Berry and to Officer Connor at that time, when the back-up officers arrived, and we can tell by the comment of the first arriving officer that they were explained about the sugar reaction because the first comment was,</text>
            <text syncTime="162.856" offset="798723">"I've seen a lot of people with sugar diabetes before but none that ever acted like this. "</text>
            <text syncTime="168.158" offset="819935">"There must be... he must be drunk. "</text>
            <text syncTime="170.693" offset="830070">"Let's lock him up. "</text>
            <text syncTime="172.628" offset="837803">And they grabbed him, and they turned him over and they handcuffed him very tightly, so tightly that at the conclusion of this episode he had cut wrists; and they lifted him up by his arms and they carried him to the hood of Mr. Berry's car and laid him over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.304" offset="900496">At this time, he regained his senses and began to talk with the officers and complain about the treatment he was receiving, and he asked them to please check his back pocket for his diabetic decal to show that he was indeed a diabetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.849" offset="966638">The response was, an officer told him to shut up and slammed his head into the hood of the police car... or, I'm sorry, Mr. Berry's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.889" offset="1002792">A few moments later, no less than four police officers grabbed Mr. Graham, one on each arm, one on each leg, picked him physically off the ground, carried him to a police car, opened the back door and threw him in, to use the Petitioner's words, like he was a sack of potatoes, and they drove him home... never arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.266" offset="1076353">When he arrived home they unhandcuffed him and he fell flat on the ground, and he was carried within a few moments for medical attention and the examining physician discovered he had a broken foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.408" offset="1124941">He in fact had an insulin reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.360" offset="1136748">His blood sugar count was very low; and they discovered that he had cut wrists and he had a large abrasion over his right eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.716" offset="1170185">He had an injured right shoulder that prohibited him to the extent that for two weeks he could not administer his own insulin shots.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.488" offset="1205189">He missed five and a half weeks of work at the North Carolina Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.875" offset="1226818">He incurred medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.975" offset="1235177">All as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.593" offset="1245626">On these facts, the lower courts on a directed verdict held that these acts by the police officers had violated no constitutional right of Mr. Graham to be free from bodily harm and physical abuse at the hands of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.520" offset="1305394">May it please the Court, this decision is wrong, and it is wrong for four reasons.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Gerald Beaver</label>
            <text syncTime="313.218" offset="1400167">The 4th Circuit United States Court of Appeals, we contend, created a generic hybrid type of constitutional right with no specific provision as to what the constitutional anchor for the analysis is.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.810" offset="1466518">They permitted the consideration of the subjective intent of the officers when it is our contention that two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence of this Court forbids such an analysis.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="342.137" offset="1515837">So you're saying they applied the wrong rule of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Gerald Beaver</label>
            <text syncTime="344.570" offset="1525554">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.272" offset="1536421">They are wrong because they failed to understand that whenever force is used by officers to seize a citizen, the 4th Amendment, by its very own terms preventing, or prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure, controls analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.281" offset="1596398">The decision is wrong because it fails to apply the principles that were laid down by this Court in Tennessee v. Garner, an objective standard of reasonableness test to analyze this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.608" offset="1645718">It was wrong because it suggests contrary to two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence, beginning in 1967 with this Court's decision in the Schmarber case, that at a minimum the 4th Circuit held that it was relevant to consider, at a minimum that it was relevant to consider, not only was the officer's conduct unreasonable, but whether the officer inflicted pain on the citizen maliciously, sadistically, for the very purpose of causing harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.258" offset="1752297">The 4th Amendment forbids that, Tennessee v. Garner and Terry v. Ohio tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.595" offset="1777688">And finally, the decision was wrong because the court below erred as a matter of law in resolving credibility issues, weighing testimony, determining credibility in the light not most favorable to the Petitioner and drawing unfavorable inferences in deciding and affirming its directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.874" offset="1846756">Initially, all parties in briefs concede that the Petitioner was seized in this case, when Officer Connor informed the Petitioner and Berry that they were not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.080" offset="1887612">However, the inquiry was not stopped there, for we are told in Terry v. Ohio that a seizure which is reasonable at its inception may violate the 4th amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.172" offset="1948007">To quote this court in Tennessee v. Garner, reasonableness depends not only when a seizure is made, but also how it is carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.612" offset="1985727">Tennessee v. Garner relied upon two decades of 4th Amendment jurisprudence of this court and analyzed an officer's use of force in seizing a suspect from an objective standard of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.955" offset="2039122">May it please the Court, Tennessee v. Garner logically controls the disposition of this claim just as Terry and its progeny controls the framework of Tennessee v. Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.829" offset="2082590">Inexplicably, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal fails to even cite or mention Tennessee v. Garner or the objective standard of reasonableness and instead embarks upon a determination of the Petitioner's claim based upon a substantive due process concept which was first formulated by the 2nd Circuit in its 1973 decision in Johnson v. Glick.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.826" offset="2170570">In Glick, relying upon this Court's 1952 decision in Rochin v. California, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held that the due process clause protects criminal suspects from police conduct that shocks the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.037" offset="2239429">But of course, Rochin, the analytical predecessor of Glick, predated Mapp v. Ohio, and at that time, at the time Rochin was decided the 4th Amendment was not a part of the Constitution made applicable to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.082" offset="2307661">Nonetheless, Judge Friendly announced four tests to be used in analyzing this'shock the conscience' test, the fourth of which was a wholly subjective factor of whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.228" offset="2388222">These factors have since been used by a number of Circuits including the one below to analyze excessive force claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.066" offset="2415598">However, we submit that the continued use of this substantive Glick test, and particularly its fourth factor, in seizure and arrest cases, is patently at odds with the express words of the 4th Amendment and the holdings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.557" offset="2469515">And that is for four reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.917" offset="2530955">But what they do not concede is that... they would have this Court believe, and the 4th Circuit would hold, that its decision which relied upon the four Glick factors and discussed the four Glick factors, it would have us believe that that is simply another way of stating objective standard of reasonableness, and it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.201" offset="2632101">Objective standard of reasonableness forbids, strictly forbids a look at subjective intent, and the reason for this is it is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.342" offset="2680689">It is irrelevant to an objective 4th Amendment consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.378" offset="2692810">Two examples: Tennessee v. Garner is a prime example of why it is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.031" offset="2711409">In that case, clearly a majority of this Court held that the conduct engaged upon by the officers was objectively unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.428" offset="5681009">That decision does not implicate the question the Petitioner has asked this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.332" offset="5700653">The question presented and briefed and argued today by Petitioner is whether excessive force claims under the 4th Amendment and Section 1983 are governed by a subjective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.540" offset="5741404">Now, let me note that the Petitioner himself concedes in his brief that he never focused his claim on the 4th Amendment either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.127" offset="5775781">Indeed, his complaint nowhere refers to the 4th Amendment, even though it was filed some approximately four months after Garner was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.732" offset="5810158">And today, Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals for not referring to either Terry or Garner in its opinion, out I note that his brief in the Court of Appeals cited neither of those cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="2590.802" offset="10510527">I think the problem in this case, or in Whitley against Albers, or in Garner, is to formulate a constitutional standard that allows... that accommodates the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to use force on the one hand, but doesn't allow them to use force that is simply gratuitous or unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.799" offset="10594433">The problem is basically the same in those two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.286" offset="10616376">Now it may be that taking the context into account, the law enforcement officials can do different things in those two areas in balancing the two competing considerations, but the underlying problem is very much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.325" offset="10660575">An example may help to illustrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.544" offset="10665486">If the prison riot that occurred in Whitley had occurred at a pretrial detention center like the MCC in New York, the 8th Amendment wouldn't have applied because those people hadn't yet been convicted of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.501" offset="10717313">And yet riot in a jail, it seems to me, could be handled in precisely the same way that the riot in Whitley was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.238" offset="10740196">The fact that the jail situation would be analyzed under Bell against Wolfish and 5th Amendment substantive due process terms, whereas the Whitley situation was analyzed in 8th Amendment terms, doesn't really change very much, if at all, the real issue that's before the Courts in dealing with these kinds of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.136" offset="10815847">And similarly, in the 4th Amendment area, the question again is what is a reasonable range of choice for police officers in carrying out their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.175" offset="10855971">Now, the test we would propose... and it differs in language but I don't think in philosophy from the Court of Appeals... is this: force is unreasonable under the 4th Amendment if it is clearly excessive, such that no reasonably competent police officer could have thought it appropriate because it was arbitrary in relation to any legitimate law enforcement need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.392" offset="10956803">In other words, so long as the use of force was debatable and within the range of judgment of reasonable police officers, it is not a federal constitutional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.533" offset="11009466">And we think that is in sum and substance very much what the Court of Appeals was getting at in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.603" offset="11033708">It was trying to determine, through the malicious and sadistic standard, when the use of force was appropriate for a law enforcement need on the one hand, or when it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.161" offset="11075922">When it was simply being used, to quote the language, maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of inflicting harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.248" offset="11104238">We think that was the issue the Court was grappling with, and its standard drew the line in that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.219" offset="11124196">Now, let me talk a little bit more about the general 4th Amendment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.306" offset="11152513">We don't disagree that this case can be analyzed in 4th Amendment terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.491" offset="11165261">We don't disagree that the 4th Amendment establishes an objective reasonableness test judged in the light of the totality of the circumstances as they appeared to the officers at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.530" offset="11205385">And indeed, the 4th Circuit itself recently applied an objective reasonableness standard under the 4th Amendment in a recent decision called Martin v. Gentile, which is reported in 849 F. 2c.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.106" offset="11259719">We do, though, strongly disagree with the way in which Petitioner proposes that the 4th Amendment test be understood and implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.014" offset="11303292">Now, it is axiomatic, we think, that the use of force is a necessary and unavoidable part of police work, including arrests and stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.821" offset="11350521">As the North Carolina amicus brief explains, police daily confront dangerous, often violent situations that require split-second judgments on the scene, in difficult, uncertain and fast-changing circumstances that pose serious risks and injury or even death to the police officers and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.135" offset="11431814">It should be recognized that there is a range of actions that would be reasonable for the police to take in light of their appraisal on the scene, on the spot of the ambiguous and changing circumstances as they see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.579" offset="11501613">It's important that not every state battery claim against the police official be converted into a federal lawsuit under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.619" offset="11541737">Not every battery becomes a federal constitutional case simply because the defendant is a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.658" offset="11577891">In judging the actions of the police officers it is also important that they not be... not be looked at in hindsight in the calm of the courtroom to determine whether the officers acted in the best possible way, or whether they used no more force than we can now see was absolutely necessary in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.520" offset="11649362">And that's basically what Petitioner's test proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.072" offset="11663572">His standard is the hypothetical reasonable police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.309" offset="11684470">The force is excessive if the hypothetical police officer would not have thought that it was reasonably required and necessary in the circumstances, and that language... reasonably required and necessary... is contained in Petitioner's brief on pages 25 and 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.004" offset="11751344">Now, Petitioner of course pays lip service to the concerns that I raise, but it's clear from the way he would apply his test in this case that he doesn't really mean them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.341" offset="11780601">His test would enshrine the Restatement of Torts in the Constitution, and would convert every battery case against the police officer under state law into a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.799" offset="11822501">I read his brief, I've listened to his argument, and he proposes no principle... no basis... for saying that some battery actions fall only under state law and distinguishing those that he says would be a federal constitutional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.142" offset="11879866">Every such arrest that involves the use of force is a potential federal civil rights case under his proposed test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.879" offset="11906825">Every claim that the police officers used more force than was necessary... that is, they were appropriately using some force, but simply used more than they reasonably should have, would state a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.104" offset="11955726">Every contention that a suspect was thrown a little bit too hard against a wall, or that an officer's grip on a suspect was a little too hard--</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.543" offset="12109430">Now, there's one part of Petitioner's test that I'd like to comment on specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.162" offset="12123954">As the Solicitor General's brief makes clear, Petitioner's test calls for a comparison between the police officer's conduct and any less forcible alternatives that they might have used in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.970" offset="12171184">That's a least drastic means test, and we think it's wholly out of place in this context and inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Whitley against Albers, in Bell against Wolfish and most particularly in Martinez Fuerte, which was itself a 4th Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.730" offset="12226250">A reasonable governmental action does not become unreasonable simply because the police did not take the best possible option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.633" offset="12253835">At least so long as the choices were within the ranges of debatable alternatives, the fact that the best one is not selected does not render the choice made unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.274" offset="12292392">Another problem with the Petitioner's least drastic means approach is that it practically invites the jury to second-guess the actions of the police officers and to substitute its judgment for theirs as to what should have happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.986" offset="12363236">It does draw on that, as well as the 4th Amendment notion of reasonableness, but we think that really is the core inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.389" offset="12388836">When is it reasonable, when is it rational for police to use the force that they did in the way that they did, or when was it unrelated to some legitimate law enforcement need?</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.078" offset="12423631">And I don't know that juries are going to be very good at making that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.967" offset="12463128">They're going to be deliberating this in the calm hindsight of the courtroom, and it's going to be all too easy for them to conclude that it would have been better for the police to have acted differently, and that should not be the constitutional standard and it should not be left to the juries to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.636" offset="12581829">If it was, it's a 4th Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.088" offset="12591651">Whether the policeman is liable for it, on the other hand, would depend upon whether a reasonable policeman could have believed that he was using no more than was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.293" offset="12836470">It was hostile, perhaps, to the police officers who were abusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.745" offset="12850263">The point I'm getting at is, I don't believe the police can create their own exigency and then complain that they had to use force against someone to get themselves out of the exigency that they have created by their own objectively unreasonable behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.043" offset="13143461">We've heard these cries of wolf, that if such a standard were to be adopted the floodgates would be let down, before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.682" offset="13185989">But to be quite candid, there are a mountain of problems bringing cases such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.088" offset="13211589">The Monell doctrine prohibits bringing other than the most egregious, clearest policy, practice and procedure cases against municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.028" offset="13247429">Qualified good faith immunity protects officers much as Justice Scalia has just correctly discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.198" offset="13276059">It is easy to confuse the objective standard of reasonableness and qualified good faith immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.351" offset="13300718">It is a substantial protection for police officers who act with objective good faith in their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.505" offset="13325274">The Detura decision issued by this Court two years ago, which prohibited the awarding of substantial damages on the basis of violation of constitutional rights alone without any regard whatsoever for physical injury, would certainly deter the bringing of most de minimus lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.717" offset="13398103">And having practiced in the United States District Courts in these type of cases, may I say we are acutely aware of the requirements of Rule 11, and we are going to be absolutely certain of our cases before they are pled and they are brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.876" offset="13450766">Turning to the facts of this case, again I believe that my opponent continues to misjudge the standard of evidence in the light most favorable to the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.820" offset="13510534">He states that our own expert testified that the seizure was appropriate, but if you will look closely at the record you will find that this testimony occurred during a voir dire hearing, if I'm correct, as to his expertise in which he was posed a hypothetical question which he did not posit with any and all of the facts subsequently brought into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.782" offset="13586394">And at another time, when presented another hypothetical case, with all the... hypothetical question... with all the pertinent factors in, stated that in his opinion the seizure of the Petitioner was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.457" offset="13641146">My opponent in this matter would have this Court imply or approve an objective standard of reasonableness but something else test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.515" offset="13685345">That something else, we don't know exactly what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.117" offset="13695794">It's somewhere between the 8th Amendment requirement and the objective standard of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.021" offset="13719409">This Court clearly has never applied subjective factors such as here, except in the Albers situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.025" offset="13747412">That case has been recently, and that decision... that malicious and sadistic, an intent to harm... has been recently reaffirmed by this Court no later today, and the decision to deny certiorari in the case of Dudley v. Stubbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.118" offset="13811778">There Justice O'Connor, even for speaking in dissent, for the three Justices in dissent, clearly recognizes there that there is a distinction between the willful indifference test in the nonriot situation and the substantive condition in the prison riot situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.980" offset="13875203">The only purposes of the dissent is to say in that factual circumstance the dissenters feel that sufficient evidence was presented of a prison riot-type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.936" offset="13918985">There is absolutely no reason, as Judge Butzner says in his dissent, and this Court has never at any time even hinted, that the substantial wall against liability created in cases involving convicted prisoners should be applied to free and innocent citizens.</text>
