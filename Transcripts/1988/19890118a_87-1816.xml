            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Melillo</label>
            <text syncTime="71.576" offset="421473">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.112" offset="435579">The issue in this case is whether the Congress intended Federal Rule of Evidence 609-A-1 could be the standard for deciding whether to admit evidence of a party's felonies for purposes of impeachment in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.503" offset="485107">Petitioner takes the position that Congress intended no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.955" offset="498900">Such a view of the law of that particular rule leads to results which are not only unfair, but bizarre.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.978" offset="523037">Rather, Petitioner takes the view, as have most of the courts which have decided this issue that in civil cases, the trial judge must retain significant discretion over whether to admit such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.952" offset="570893">By way of background, this case arose as a civil product liability case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.253" offset="588134">Allegedly, a laundry water extractor manufactured by Bock Machine Company was defective and that defect resulted in the Plaintiff, the 19-year old Plaintiff's arm being torn off.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.295" offset="632333">In the Third Circuit, in the case of Diggs v. Lyons, there was a decision... two to one... that in civil cases, Rule 609(a)(1) mandates without any part of discretion, on the part of the trial judge, that evidence of impeachment felonies must be admitted in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.340" offset="700461">For that reason, the trial judge was bound in this case to admit such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.959" offset="718955">Since the Diggs decision, one other circuit court has joined that reasoning in the case of Greer v.... Campbell v. Greer in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.897" offset="750720">And I would point out that since joining that decision, the Seventh Circuit now has a division within it... excuse me, the Eighth Circuit now has a division within itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.984" offset="779037">So that now, there is not only a division between the Circuits, it is the one... the First, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth takes the view that there is discretion, but now, the Third and Seventh oppose that.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.907" offset="814773">And within the Seventh there is itself, a division between panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.144" offset="831700">It is Petitioner's position that Diggs and Campbell are wrong for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.632" offset="853643">The literal language of the rule could not sensibly be applied to civil cases, if it intended such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.702" offset="881960">Second, the legislative record does not show that Congress intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.689" offset="901917">Third, other principles of statutory construction, well settled in our law, would be violated if that result occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.009" offset="931174">Turning first to the literal language of the rule... the rule says that felonies will be admitted unless... unless the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.221" offset="995958">It does not say criminal defendant; it does not say civil defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.923" offset="1010795">If you were to apply that rule literally to civil cases, you would have to apply a weighing or balancing procedure to the civil defendant or the civil plaintiff or other witnesses would not have the advantage of that particular rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.924" offset="1122809">But the point is that the rule is so ambiguous on its face, that it lends credence to the view which I intend to get into, that Congress never considered the effect the rule should have with respect to civil parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.898" offset="1166694">Congress was consumed solely with the plight of the criminal defendant when it debated and enacted this rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.273" offset="1212252">Why can't you say that the rule is talking about prejudicial effect to the criminal defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.109" offset="1235553">There is no criminal defendant in a civil case and therefore, the outweighing doesn't apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.398" offset="1364702">The rule was changed to simply permit the use of his felony conviction against him for impeachment purposes, but over the course of decades, that rule was modified to the extent that the trial court would retain discretion to judge whether the probative value of that particular was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.694" offset="1449862">I mean up until the time of the codification of the Federal Rules of Evidence, it depended on the laws of the various states, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="334.798" offset="1474312">It was one of the sources that the Judges looked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.834" offset="1482462">They also looked at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43, which was said to have a bias in favor of admissibility, federal equity cases and the rule of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.540" offset="1521228">So that a federal common law developed which took its basis from many sources, and which while generally, admitting these felonies, did retain, or did provide that the trial court was some measure of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.254" offset="1704085">The main reason being it is much more arguable that Congress did intend to specifically cover that field when it enacted &lt;six oh nine&gt;[= 609], if you look at the legislative history than it is in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.042" offset="1747240">That the legislative history is simply devoid of any consideration of how to treat the civil litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.259" offset="8500206">"Has the Plaintiff shown by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the extractor, manufactured by the Defendant in 1965, was defective when it left the Defendant's control? "</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.083" offset="8551406">The second and third question, had to do with the nature of the defect and causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.866" offset="8642626">Now, that was the question, the only question that bore on the Plaintiff's credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.336" offset="8664464">The jury returned a verdict and this colloquy ensued.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.881" offset="8734681">The foreman answered no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.681" offset="8745862">I would therefore submit that this case did not turn on, credibility at all and that the evidence of the prior conviction would not have been prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.855" offset="8790583">Now, I would now like to turn to congressional intent, and I think there are three considerations that have to be examined in considering that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.263" offset="8840216">Now, the first is the prior rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.615" offset="8849620">The second is the forces which converged on formulating these rules of evidence, and the third is the enactment of a rule and the enactment of the exception, because these were distinct occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.958" offset="8902910">Contrary to Mr. Melillo's view of this, I believe that it is clear that the prior rule was that there was no balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.449" offset="8952960">The Advisory Committee note says, the weight of judicial authority has been to allow the use of felonies, generally, without regard to the nature of the particular offense and of crimen falsi without regard to the grade of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.143" offset="9019729">In one of the Congressional Committee's report, the following appears: The congressional... the conventional view and hesitatingly supported by Wigmore has been that an accused, who elects to take the stand, is subject to impeachment as a witness, including impeachment by proof of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.824" offset="9110427">In 1961, and if the Advisory Committee was appointed and for, it began its consideration of the codification of the Rules of Evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.984" offset="9163089">In 1965, the District Court of the District of Columbia decided the Luck case, in which it inserted a balancing test into the D.C. Rule, which made... which applied the traditional rule... that is, any felony and any grade of crime crimen falsi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.801" offset="9274371">There was immediate and adverse reaction to that in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.472" offset="9301016">And Congress amended the D.C. Act and took out the word "may" and inserted the word "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.180" offset="9339886">So that the practice in the District of Columbia is under the traditional rule, and there is no balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.403" offset="9384712">The Advisory Committee submitted its report to Congress, and it was considered extensively in the Judiciary Commitees of the House and Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.878" offset="9438629">There is a report, from which I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.318" offset="9580422">That was rejected in the final version by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.372" offset="9604559">The bill passed by the Senate allowed impeachment by the introduction of conviction of a crimen falsi crime, or any other crime, if the imprisonment was in excess of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.798" offset="9662342">And that was the recommendation of this Court also to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.701" offset="9685956">The House Impeachment was only as to crimen falsi crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.705" offset="9713960">In the Conference Committee... and as I have said before... there is a scant record, but the one record which is clear, is that they used the word "convict" when they applied the balancing to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.603" offset="9785535">And, as I have stated before, all of the bodies that were looking at this matter considered various alternatives and all of those... some of those alternatives would have allowed the balancing test to be applied to witnesses, in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.730" offset="9858051">And, of course, Chief Justice Rehnquist, as you pointed out, under Rule 1101, it is very clear that these rules are applicable to both criminal and civil cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.071" offset="10327419">As I said before, in the debates, when they did discuss applying the balancing test, they only discussed it as to a criminal defendant because they said that the jury, the prejudice of the jury might be that if he committed one crime, that he would commit another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.169" offset="10415818">In this instance of a civil plaintiff, the rationale would have to be that because he was convicted of a crime, he is unworthy of a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.024" offset="10451240">And I just think that is a quantum leap and that it is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.328" offset="10472451">Now, in regard to Rule 403, I think there are several reasons, or three reasons, why 403 would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.386" offset="10516650">It is, of course, a general rule and the note or the comment to that rule set a guide for handling situations for which no specific rules have been formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.794" offset="10566283">It differs by one word from the balancing test in 609.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.431" offset="10588853">The word is "substantially".</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.300" offset="10596271">But it seems to me that if they wanted 403, or if anyone understood that 403 was going to apply to 609, that they could have saved the time of the debates in regard to having any balancing test in 609.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.523" offset="10653218">Where it must fall, I believe, however, is in the 609(a)(1) and 609(a)(2) argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.563" offset="10689372">If 403 applies to 609 (a)(1), then it would apply to 609(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.902" offset="10722704">Now, the report of the Conference Committee in speaking of the balancing test, given to a... and they were speaking of convicting a... defendant in a criminal case... the admission of prior convictions involving dishonesty and false statement is not within the discretion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.196" offset="10787906">Such convictions are particularly probative of credibility and under this rule, must always be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.267" offset="10816222">So, they just were speaking of the rule, itself, and it is completely illogical to say that it applies to one subject... one subsection and not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.710" offset="10874005">The other problem that you run into in applying 403 to this rule is that there are other specific rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.333" offset="10912458">And if you apply 403 to this one, then you have to look at every other rule and see if you are going to apply 403 to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.940" offset="10950910">Taking from the Petitioner's brief, the reasons that are set forth there in regard to his interpretation of the rule is that it should not vary the common law, except to the extent the change appears clearly in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.937" offset="11038890">Well, this rule would vary the common law as it existed prior to the enactment of the rule so far as the federal courts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.310" offset="11076402">That it should not conflict with companion statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.995" offset="11087060">Well, the only other companion statute... I don't know if it is a companion statute... but the only other Congressional enactment on this is the D.C. statute, and that has no balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.636" offset="11133662">Finally, that it should not encourage forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.706" offset="11153933">Well, it seems to me that applying the balancing test, adding more broadly than the statute allows really does encourage forum shopping because there are no guidelines really set forth as to how the balancing should be applied, and some judges are going to apply it in favor of admitting evidence, and others are going to apply it in favor of excluding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.023" offset="11259259">Finally, it replaces uncertainty with, with certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.511" offset="11281202">Judge Marris, who was Chairman of the Supreme Court Committee, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.581" offset="11305444">"The adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence will provide clear, precise and readily available rules for trial judges and trial lawyers to follow which will be uniformly applicable throughout the federal judicial system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.025" offset="11367197">And, of course, if you have a balancing test, you are going to wind up with different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.162" offset="11387782">The Justice Department criticized in one of its reports to the Committees, the balancing test, because there was no standard for the trial judge to follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.177" offset="11791844">One is that Congress was so concerned about the rights of the defendant and that the defendant not be convicted, except if he is truly guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.366" offset="11828624">Therefore, Congress would permit the criminal defendant to have the right to impeach the prosecution's witness while potentially, himself, being immune from impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.774" offset="11878257">It also must be understood, though, that there are many avenues for impeaching civil parties that are not available in criminal cases, and therefore it is not necessary to have, even ask it to rule in civil cases with regard to impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.016" offset="11935204">There are many ways of getting at the truth in civil cases, that potentially are not available in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.187" offset="11959863">This is the rationale as to fairness... Congress did not really go to the trouble of considering all of this, but I think it's, it's the basis for any fair and just statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.210" offset="12003958">I just want, to make a few brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.928" offset="12014825">First, about the prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.780" offset="12026214">I quoted this in my brief, but I guess it is worth repeating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.732" offset="12038022">Judge Fremley of the Second Circuit testified before the Subcommittee of the House, and he was asked about the traditional practice and he said they were generally admissible, but of course, there was the overriding rule that the judge can always exclude testimony where probative value, he thinks, is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.295" offset="12120255">He was, in effect, giving the common law to the Advisory Committee, and that is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.366" offset="12140631">That particular statement comports very well with what Rule 403 says.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.280" offset="12220252">But he also said, almost in the same statement, but of course, there is always Rule 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.748" offset="12234149">What he meant was 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.683" offset="12241881">He believed that Rule 403 would cut across it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.468" offset="12257032">Representative Hogan... I believe, it is cited as Hungate in Respondent's, brief... opposed the version which the House handed down.</text>
