            <text syncTime="474.154" offset="2039171">In any event, in the course of the Aldinger case several comments were made which are instructive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.093" offset="2066861">First of all, it was recognized that there are some circumstances where pendent-party jurisdiction may be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.997" offset="2090476">One of which was where jurisdiction is exclusive in the federal court, such as under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.401" offset="2116180">That was clearly dicta, but it was encouraging to me when I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.686" offset="2133317">The two factors that the Aldinger case set forth in determining when pendent-party jurisdiction might be appropriate were, first of all, the existence or absence of congressional... constitutional authority, which is the question you raised, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.612" offset="2189010">And secondly whether or not the anchor federal jurisdiction negates pendent-party jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.016" offset="2210639">I would submit that where the Federal Tort Claims Act is the anchor jurisdiction and the United States Government is the defendant, then Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 provides ample constitutional grounds for the exercise of pendent-party jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.192" offset="2275318">That particular clause provides federal judicial power in controversies in which the United States shall be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.964" offset="2306352">Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the United States is clearly a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.999" offset="2322548">And from that point forward, the court should have continuing judicial power to resolve the entire tort claim, including joint tortfeasors.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1552.431" offset="6352301">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.989" offset="6406531">There are, we submit, three basic points that need to be stressed in the consideration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.546" offset="6448745">First, federal subject matter jurisdiction depends not only on a source of authority under Article III of the Constitution, but also on a specific statutory grant of authority in an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.591" offset="6520843">In the context of pendent-party jurisdiction this Court made it clear in Aldinger against Howard that the question is whether the governing statute expressly or by implication negates an existence or negates the existence of pendent-party jurisdiction in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.873" offset="6621989">Second, when we look at the relevant statute in this case, Section 1346(b), the Tort Claims Act jurisdictional provision, we find that the statute does indeed negate pendent-party jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.370" offset="6695968">It does so both, in our view, because of the clear statutory language which is limited to the existence of jurisdiction for claims against the United States and because any doubts about the meaning of that language are, we submit, resolved by the very specific legislative history which makes it clear that joinder of other codefendants is not contemplated as being within the scope of this jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.626" offset="6841000">Third, the Petitioner in this case has placed great emphasis on claims of convenience and judicial economy as being a basis for pendent-party jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.303" offset="6899723">We submit that even where those claims as strong as petitioner makes them out, they cannot supply subject matter jurisdiction where the statutes in point do not confer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.979" offset="6954476">But to the extent that the statutes themselves may create any doubt, we submit that the claims of convenience and economy in Petitioner's brief and at argument here today are very much overstated, that the fact is that very significant differences between tort claims litigation against the United States and ordinary state law litigation against private parties are so great that these claims of efficiency and economy are very unlikely to be realized, and that indeed if pendent-party Jurisdiction were recognized here, the cost to the federal system might be very great without any corresponding gains to the state courts where these controversies in our view belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.412" offset="7160216">On the first of these points, that is, the necessity of looking to the governing statute, I don't think there is much need to spend a great deal of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.053" offset="7210789">This Court has made it clear repeatedly in cases like Aldinger and others that statutory authority for jurisdiction must be found and the Petitioner concedes that that is the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.145" offset="7267109">We would emphasize only that in this context the question that we should take to this statute is whether the statute has addressed the party against whom an action may be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.072" offset="7330848">In this case, the Tort Claims Act Section 1346(b) has done exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.678" offset="7361255">As the statute was originally enacted in 1946, it conferred jurisdiction on the district courts to hear, determine, and render judgment on any claim against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.639" offset="7433039">Now, this Court held in the Yellow Cab case that the phrase "claim against the United States" must be broadly construed to encompass any claim against the United States in tort, including third party claims for contribution or indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.368" offset="7503988">But in this case Petitioner is asking us to read that language as if it meant claims not only against the United States but against nonfederal governmental parties as well, and we submit the language simply does not admit that construction, particularly in the context of a waiver of sovereign immunity, which is what the Tort Claims Act itself involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.251" offset="7607537">There was a minor change of wording in the Tort Claims Act in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.191" offset="7639302">As part of the revision of the title and the codification of it into positive law, the revisers changed the language so that the district courts were given jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.653" offset="7717147">We submit that this minor change in wording accomplished no effect in terms of the jurisdictional scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.841" offset="7753927">And we believe that is true for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.126" offset="7766988">First of all, we don't think the words themselves accommodate any different reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.149" offset="7799171">We believe it is still true that the most natural reading is that the grant of jurisdiction is confined to the entertainment of claims against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.522" offset="7832608">Second, this particular change was part of a very thoroughgoing revision of Title 28 of the U.S. Code, and the revisers in the course of their revision took great pains to note any changes in wording that were intended to accomplish significant changes in substantive outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.037" offset="7926649">For example, in the removal provisions of 1441(c), the revisers said that the change in language from separable controversy to separate and independent controversy was intended to achieve a significant result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.832" offset="7997806">No such comment was made here--</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.903" offset="8022153">Because if one just looks at the language of the statute in its preexisting form, it would not have covered a suit in which these two private parties are also defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.341" offset="8059873">But in plain language now it does cover it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.944" offset="8290273">But I think our case is greatly strengthened by two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.913" offset="8306156">One is it's earlier version in 1946 and the other is the legislative history of the Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.085" offset="8334890">Well, if you just compare it with the earlier version, one could say well, the change was intended to make some difference, and ergo, it's a different rule now than it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.573" offset="8364775">That always cuts both ways.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="2057.358" stopTime="2352.466">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="2057.358" offset="8371984">We think there are really two reasons in addition to the problematic character of the language itself why the '48 change was not intended to make any... not intended to make any revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.415" offset="8420154">One is, as I say, the revisers took pains to spell out where a change was intended, and this would have been a rather dramatic change to be making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.104" offset="8458920">Secondly, the use of the words i.e., in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which said there shall be one form of action known as the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.637" offset="8549095">Throughout the revision of the judicial code, the revisers incorporated references to civil action to distinguish them from the criminal actions that were also within the jurisdiction of the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.479" offset="8604474">We acknowledge that the language of the '48 revision is somewhat broader, although we think it too sustains our result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.919" offset="8638224">We think it is consistent with the '46 version both because no change in substance was intended by the revisers and because the legislative history of the Tort Claims Act in 1946 is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.512" offset="8704575">To understand that legislative history it is necessary to understand the case of United States against Sherwood which was decided in 1941, only a few years before the Tort Claims Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.723" offset="8773434">United States against Sherwood was an action under the Tucker Act in the district court against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.412" offset="8808125">It was brought by a judgment creditor for the purpose of enforcing a contract right of his judgment debtor against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.387" offset="8856086">As required by New York law, the judgment creditor sought to join the judgment debtor as a codefendant against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.611" offset="8896941">And it appeared that that joinder was required in order for the action to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.229" offset="8919406">This Court held that the jurisdiction conferred on the district courts by the Tucker Act was not broad enough to encompass the joinder of that private defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.239" offset="8971442">The Court said that Congress' waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the Tucker Act was no broader in the District Court than it was in the court of claims and that did not admit of an action against a private codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.450" offset="9040301">Now, we do not contend that standing by itself Sherwood governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.319" offset="9055766">This case is different in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.104" offset="9066946">It's different because we're dealing with the Tort Claims Act rather than the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.389" offset="9084082">It's different because the jurisdiction of the federal courts is not the mirror image tied into the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.530" offset="9128595">What makes United States against Sherwood so relevant here is that in drafting the Tort Claims Act Congress was very much aware of the decision and, we think it is clear, intended the very same limitation to exist with respect to the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.658" offset="9205186">In 1942 in the first major version of what became the Tort Claims Act the House Report on their version of the Tucker Act cited the Sherwood case and went on to say that the intention of the Tort Claims Act was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.155" offset="9283135">The bill does not permit any person to be joined as a defendant with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.059" offset="9310721">After that, the House Report goes on to discuss the point raised by Petitioner in her reply brief to say that the liability of the United States as a joint tortfeasor would be determined by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.854" offset="9377908">But then it goes it goes on to say, however, as noted before, no person may be joined with the United States as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.043" offset="9414688">The language in the 1942 House Report was repeated in the 1945 House Report of the very bill that did become the Tort Claims Act in l946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.171" offset="9483233">And so we contend there can be very little doubt that Congress intended a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, did not intend to authorize suits both against the United States and private codefendants on the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.504" offset="10416536">As I said at the outset, we contend very strongly that those arguments cannot supply a basis of jurisdiction if authority for the exercise of that jurisdiction cannot be found in a governing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.014" offset="10478603">But we contend also very strongly that the Petitioner's position on questions of efficiency and economy is grossly overstated, that in fact there are so many differences between a tort claims action against the United States and a state law action against a nonfederal defendant that these efficiencies are very likely not to be achieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.543" offset="11720673">Certainly not 1346(b) which authorizes the bringing of a state law action against a non-diverse defendant simply because there is pending in the federal courts a tort claims action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.404" offset="11788174">And we believe to read 1346(b) to authorize that would lead to the ejection, potentially, of a whole variety of issues into a federal court that would not otherwise be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.497" offset="11848464">In this very case one of those issues is punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.318" offset="11863824">Also in this very case the Plaintiffs have... the Plaintiff has demanded a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.138" offset="11887126">So that what would otherwise not be a jury trial with all the procedural and other advantages that that has for litigating on behalf of the United States would either be converted into a kind of dual trial, a jury trial at a non-jury trial, or perhaps because of that very problem the judge might find it necessary, even if the cases were one case, to separate the two out for trial and to have a non-jury trial of the tort claims action and a jury trial of the independent state law action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.288" offset="12423681">It may or may not be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.740" offset="12429532">But that would only happen if there were a specific decision by the United States that in view of its interests, in view of the institutional interests of both the United States and the federal courts, it made sense to implead those parties as third party defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.451" offset="12508317">Once that were done, I think there would be a very strong argument for allowing the plaintiff to allege a claim directly if she has one against the third party defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.926" offset="12546247">Rule 14 does authorize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.795" offset="12557741">But, at least in the situation where those parties are not already in the case, our concern is that recognizing pendent-party jurisdiction might throw on the discretion of the district courts a very heavy burden, a discretion that would be essentially unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.840" offset="12633914">To make decisions about when and whether consolidation of trial makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.010" offset="12658574">Our suspicion is that many of these cases would end up in state courts anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.230" offset="12679472">In the case of Moor against the County of Alameda, a 1983 case, that's exactly what happened and this court did not reach the pendent-party question because the district court had decided, in its discretion, to send the state case back to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.657" offset="12745196">Even in those cases that were kept in federal court, we contend that the trial judge would in many cases find it inconvenient and inefficient to consolidate for trial and would end up separating the cases out for trial anyway because of the number of separate issues involved and because of the existence of a jury in one situation and not in another.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.539" offset="13140690">It's undoubted that the weakest portion of may case is the legislative history portion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.295" offset="13175694">And my position on that, our position on that, is that the plain language of the Act, and particularly after the... the amendment in 1948... the plain language provides for anchor... for the anchor jurisdictional statute to include additional parties where appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.840" offset="13245911">It does not negate pendent-party jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.125" offset="13255001">Secondly, again, looking to the scheme of the Act, the private person state law scheme of the Act, that too indicates Congress' intent to make the United States liable as a joint tortfeasor with all other potential parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.718" offset="13321353">And we would submit that those two factors make the legislative history from back in '42 or '45 or '46 to be on a relative basis of no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.609" offset="13360954">I would also point out that the... there is an inconsistency within the legislative history itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.013" offset="13394600">It says that the United States is to be liable as a joint tortfeasor in accordance with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.167" offset="13415184">Then it says there can't be a defendant with the United States, And that's inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.571" offset="13432843">They can't be a joint tortfeasor in accordance with state law if there's not another joint tortfeasor in the lawsuit with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.509" offset="13472549">That's part of trying out the claim against the United States, is trying out a claim against a... an alleged joint tortfeasor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.199" offset="13511315">If there are joint tortfeasors, they all should be in the same... the same lawsuit, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.769" offset="13529601">Mention of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, both Gibbs and Aldinger refer to the federal rules recognizing that they don't grant jurisdiction, but the scheme of the federal rules is let's get it all together, let's get it all tried, let's get it all taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.411" offset="13584144">The federal rules promote that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.113" offset="13590936">They suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.363" offset="13595952">They support what we are seeking here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.565" offset="13604833">The comment was made that this action can't be tried with the actions against the other defendants because it wouldn't be a state law or state... a state law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.872" offset="13649973">The action against the United States in the 1346(b) is a state law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.359" offset="13667945">It depends on the state law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.394" offset="13684141">So, it is a state law action, it just includes the United States as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.263" offset="13699606">The efficiencies and the absence of any real efficiencies, I don't know how to respond to that other than experientially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.417" offset="13724161">But my experience in a number of cases where the United States and private defendants were joined for various reasons... either out of the Ninth Circuit where pendent-party jurisdiction was acceptable, or in the Ninth Circuit were other jurisdictional provisions applied such as diversity... those procedural problems were all dealt with, they were all handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.997" offset="13798557">I've never seen a case involving a single action with multiple defendants tried twice in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.651" offset="13821127">We've always worked out ways to solve the jury problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.769" offset="13833561">We submit the Ninth Circuit should be reversed and the other circuit should be followed.</text>
