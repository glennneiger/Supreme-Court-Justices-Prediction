            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="17.510" offset="204921">This case is here on petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.080" offset="227177">The cases arises in the context of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.602" offset="253300">It is our contention that the court below has misunderstood that statute when it held, first, that it abrogates the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states from suit in federal court, and, second, that Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, the Petitioner here, is precluded from reviewing administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.147" offset="331458">Turning to the first issue, we believe that Congress has not abrogated the state's constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="363223">In Atascadero v. Scanlon this Court reaffirmed the concept that abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity involves a fundamental shift in the constitutional balance between the states and the federal government as well as an expansion of federal constitutional power of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.683" offset="449636">Consequently, the court has held that abrogation of immunity will not be found unless Congressional intent to subject suits to... subject states to federal court suits is unmistakably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.860" offset="510345">This clear statement rule has two fundamental and important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.764" offset="533960">First of all, it is intended to provide notice to the states who, as in the EHA, have voluntarily agreed to participate in a program to provide equal education to handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="595400">Secondly, it makes certain that Congress considers directly the problems and issues which would arise if states are subjected to suit in federal court and, therefore, lessens the chance that Congress will act in haste or without giving consideration to the constitutional balance which it will be affecting with its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.407" offset="692471">It is our position that this notice, which is required, especially to the states, has not been given to the 50 states who since 1975 have joined in this Federal Government partnership to provide appropriate education for every handicapped child in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.285" offset="768017">The court of appeals in its opinion struggled to find this clear abrogation language and in doing so it pointed to the preamble of the statute found at Section 140C(b)(9) which speaks in terms of the Federal Government's intent to assist the states in providing federal funds so that equal education can be achieved for handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.054" offset="879089">That is at page 6 of our petition for cert.--</text>
            <text syncTime="189.339" offset="892255">It also points to section 1415(e)(2)... page 11 of our petition for cert... where the... there is a provision for a hearing, a due process hearing, to the party aggrieved in the administrative hearing process, and a party so aggrieved will have the right to bring an action in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.372" offset="992356">The last basis on which the court of appeals stands is section 1415(e)(4)(G) which is the 1986 amendment to the Act, and it provides for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.250" offset="1059857">Looking at these provisions, it is absolutely clear that there is no indication at all that states were to be made liable to private parties under the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.641" offset="1105414">No state liability to private parties is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.760" offset="1121924">The abrogation of the state's immunity is nowhere mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.795" offset="1134044">The Eleventh Amendment is nowhere mentioned.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="252.830" offset="1146165">Well, now, the attorney on the other side says that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 make clear that this Act is covered at least after 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.910" offset="1222547">Would you agree with that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="274.027" offset="1231011">Not at all, Justice O'Connor, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.647" offset="1253476">The first reason is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.283" offset="1259955">And that is that that amendment is effective for violations occurring after--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="286.420" offset="1280539">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.970" offset="1282733">That's why I ask you about after 1986.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="288.737" offset="1289839">--After October 21, 1986 and, therefore, it has nothing to do with this particular case where the violations occurred long before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.693" offset="1317633">Secondly, as we discussed in our brief, the EHA is not an antidiscrimination statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="302.930" stopTime="304.799">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="302.930" offset="1346577">Well, it could be viewed as that, couldn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maria_parisivickers" startTime="304.799" stopTime="331.966">
            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="304.799" offset="1354100">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.499" offset="1356817">Any time Congress enacts a law which will provide equal distribution of benefits, it could be deemed to be an antidiscrimination statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.689" offset="1405613">However, these are... there are specific statues, those enumerated, and there are other statutes which specifically are designed to eliminate discrimination in particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.264" offset="1451902">There are entitlement statues usually.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="331.966" stopTime="338.603">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="331.966" offset="1462769">Well, this was designed to eliminate discrimination against handicapped children in schools perhaps.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maria_parisivickers" startTime="338.603" stopTime="369.674">
            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="338.603" offset="1489310">Well, this is actually... you could view this as a discrimination statute because it focuses particularly on one group and gives them benefits which other children may not be entitled to, or other groups may not be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.629" offset="1549391">For those reasons, we believe that it's not a statute which can be lumped into the category of antidiscrimination statute, and, therefore, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments does not apply, both on the merits and as to the applicable date.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="369.674" offset="1613548">Now, suppose we were to agree with you, that at least as to the claims that arose before 1986 that there is an Eleventh Amendment bar here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.501" offset="1672898">You raise a second question dealing with the authority of the Secretary?</text>

            <text syncTime="391.337" offset="1700170">But you did not challenge the lower court's ruling that lack of finality and delay caused by the remand violated federal regulations, did you?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.462" offset="1748758">That's not challenged?</text>

            <text syncTime="405.064" offset="1755132">And, Justice O'Connor, we address that concern in a footnote in our brief where we pointed out that there is a decision of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.336" offset="1792226">The Third Circuit affirmed on all counts the district court's opinion except--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="419.405" offset="1812497">--Well, what that means is that the Third Circuit's judgment with respect to the Tuition Reimbursement Board award would stand regardless of what we do on the Eleventh Amendment question.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.064" offset="1871115">That is not so because there is an attorney's fee award which depends on the number of claims which Mr. Muth would be successful on.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.487" offset="1904761">So that that--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="454.378" offset="1952409">It certainly stands as against the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.097" offset="1967246">So, how do we ever get to the second question about the Secretary?</text>
            <text syncTime="463.167" offset="1987517">I'm not sure we can.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maria_parisivickers" startTime="465.436" stopTime="672.403">
            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi-vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="465.436" offset="1996608">--Well, Justice O'Connor, we do have an order of the Third... of the district court which was appealed to the Third Circuit on the issue of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.243" offset="2039866">And that has been remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.528" offset="2052928">The attorney's fees issue was improperly decided by the district court and there is a remand on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.551" offset="2089081">And, therefore, in deciding the issue of the Secretary we will now be able to know whether or not the Commonwealth has prevailed on one or two issues, and that affects the attorney's fees determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.314" offset="2176121">Going back to the examination of the statute, this court has long since held, at least since 1973, that merely because states have been included among a class of actors is not enough to strip them of their sovereign prerogative of immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.045" offset="2251040">And an award of attorney's fees in an amendment such as the 1986 Amendment to the EHA is not sufficient either.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.667" offset="2297538">In addition, the Third Circuit used the language of the statute regarding the ability of the federal courts to grant appropriate relief under this Act to find further support for its position that the appropriate relief should be tuition reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.564" offset="2377160">We note parenthetically that it took a decision of this Court in Burlington to determine that tuition was an... tuition reimbursement was an appropriate relief at all against a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.824" offset="2430136">And in that case there was no Eleventh Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.126" offset="2447377">We suggest that the power of the federal courts in fashioning appropriate relief is constrained by Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, and that the barrier of sovereign immunity was not removed by the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.035" offset="2498995">And the reason that it was not removed is that Congress did not need to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.503" offset="2520833">It could achieve the purposes of the EHA by providing other remedies, remedies which it included in the statute and which are available to children and parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.711" offset="2561689">Primary among those remedies is the fact that parents, together with their children, participate fully at every stage of the formulation and implementation of the individualized program of education for a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.638" offset="2617382">If they're unhappy with that program of education, they can appeal the decision of the school district to an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.660" offset="2653535">If they're unhappy with that, there is a judicial remedy... a judicial review in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.962" offset="2674746">Now, once in the courts there is a judicial remedy at least against the school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.218" offset="2699720">And in the overwhelming number of cases the tuition reimbursement remedy will be available to litigants because the school districts are the ones which are usually the entitles which formulate the IEP and are in dispute with the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.228" offset="2759801">Therefore, in the overwhelming number of cases there will be a tuition reimbursement under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.064" offset="2783102">Moreover, if there is an ongoing violation of federal law, state of official can be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.035" offset="2811001">So, there is injunctive relief at that level.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.911" offset="3266472">And that is, the financial sanctions which the United States Secretary of Education can impose on the states if they do not comply with the state plans and with the regulations and statute of the EHA.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.955" offset="3454658">In fact, the states are not getting a free ride here if they are not found to be amenable to suit in federal court for money damages by an individual who has gone through the process, as Mr. Muth has, because the states are... the entitles which provide most of the funding for education, and traditionally it has been so and I think this Court can take judicial notice of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.757" offset="3549849">I would like to conclude by simply stating that just as the Congress abrogated the immunity of the states in the Rehabilitation Act Amendment of 1986, it could have done so just as easily when it amended the EHA to add on attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.452" offset="3732706">And I think that that is what the Third Circuit has engaged in in arriving at its holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.523" offset="3756947">Congress must indicate in unequivocable terms in the statute that it has considered deliberately a goal that it sets for itself, that this goal so transcends the constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the states that it must be shifted in some fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.603" offset="3833225">There is no evidence here whatsoever that the shift has occurred in the enactment of the EHA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.182" offset="5243628">That's is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.882" offset="5246345">For purposes of this argument, we have conceded that the interpretation of the Department... U.S. Department of Education, that the level of impartiality shall be the same as what we will adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.642" offset="5305382">What we do not agree, however, is that the Department... Pennsylvania's Department of Education is such an agency or unit involved in the education or care of the child because the Department is, in Pennsylvania, is charged with the generalized supervision of education over 501 school districts... it is the school districts which actually teach the approximately 1.8 million children in Pennsylvania, 271,00 of whom are special education children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.744" offset="5425858">The Department is supervising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.565" offset="5441114">It's not actually teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.683" offset="5453548">It is not actually promulgating the IEP or not getting into disputes with parents over the individual placement of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.873" offset="5494404">It is the responsibility of the Department to enforce the regulations promulgated by the Board of Education to approve curriculum, to establish standards, to approve school district plans for special education and distribution of state and federal funds in accordance with those plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.886" offset="5578413">The Department does not have hands-on teaching responsibilities for the child, and the statute... the language of the statute says education of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.777" offset="5625956">That language arises in the context of an IEP dispute, dispute for individual placement of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.848" offset="5654273">Therefore, it's certainly common sense to conclude that the Department is not involved to the extent that the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.655" offset="5701502">And, therefore, the Secretary, who is the head of that agency, would be a suitable review officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.809" offset="5726057">Theoretically, of course, the Department is involves in the care of every child... education and care of every child in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.046" offset="5755001">But the Department is not a party to these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.783" offset="5774018">It is the school district which is involved with the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.669" offset="5789587">From a common sense approach, If we asked the parent who is involved in the care of your child, you're going to hear that it's a teacher or a principal, perhaps the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.292" offset="5835981">Neither common sense nor traditional concepts of administrative law preclude the Department from reviewing these administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.100" offset="5883210">In fact, in the EHA the Department of Education is the pivotal player answering to the Federal Government in its supervision of the state plan as it is implemented by the school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.996" offset="5950815">And, therefore, it has responsibility both to the Federal Government and supervisory responsibilities over the school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.584" offset="5981222">The Secretary of Education in Pennsylvania has the same powers of financial sanctions over the school districts for failure to comply with state plans, than the United States Secretary of Education has over the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.892" offset="6030436">Certainly, we cannot conclude from this statutory framework that the Secretary of Education in Pennsylvania and the school districts will be on the same side or have any particular sympathy for each other when it comes to deciding an individual child's placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.187" offset="6099609">Moreover, the participation of the Secretary is salutary for the goals of the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.675" offset="6125522">When the Secretary of Education participates in the review process, he learns how the policies which he may have implemented, the regulations promulgated by the Department, the Board of Education... how they actually affect an individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.034" offset="6191037">And so he can learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.552" offset="6197097">If a policy is challenged, even if it's a policy that he himself makes... has made... this is an opportunity for him to rethink, reexamine the challenge and come to an appropriate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.627" offset="6245372">We submit that the Secretary of Education, bound as he is to observe the law, and as explained by this Court and by the courts of the state, will not ignore those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.650" offset="6285496">We urge, therefore, for this Court to find that the Secretary is an impartial decision maker because the agency which he heads is not involved in the education and care of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.892" offset="6338472">And, moreover, because clearly as a constitutional officer appointed by the governor he is not an employee of the agency.</text>

            <label>Ms. Martha A. Field</label>
            <text syncTime="1567.937" offset="6406600">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.973" offset="6422795">We don't think you need to reach the partiality issue in this case, and for that reason I think I'm going to put off talking about it until the end of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.281" offset="6463964">Just to say why I don't think you need to reach it, as Justice O'Connor said, the remand violation which is established is sufficient to support the reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.421" offset="6516523">And I really don't think that a rule that attorney's fees depend on the percentage of success of the attorney below means that this Court has to hear questions that are otherwise irrelevant to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.848" offset="6578276">This case is of central importance to children with handicaps and their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.018" offset="6602936">It used to be that parents whose children were born with handicaps sometimes had to give up their parental rights or even institutionalize their child in order to obtain necessary education or medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.796" offset="6666048">In 1975 in enacting the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Congress opted instead to allow parents to participate fully in decisions concerning the education of their child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.437" offset="6716621">Mr. Muth, the Respondent, exercised that right when after three and a half years of attempting to obtain an appropriate education from the school district he decided instead to place his child in a school which specializes in language disabilities, a school at which his son Alex in fact made substantial progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.435" offset="6800631">When Muth took this step, school authorities were not offering an appropriate education, as the hearing officer subsequently held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.556" offset="6837097">The remedy of reimbursement in appropriate cases is necessary in order to allow parents to participate effectively because otherwise parents would have to accept whatever education school officials offered them during the period of administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.485" offset="6908777">That period can be a significant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.037" offset="6919017">In this case, the period of administrative decisionmaking took more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.208" offset="6939706">Alex needed an education during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.310" offset="6952141">The development of handicapped children cannot be shifted to told while the decisionmaking process unwinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.646" offset="6981398">A year in an inappropriate education or without necessary services can be a devastating experience to any child, and handicapped children--</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.685" offset="7101561">This Court has unanimously recognized that tuition reimbursement is important to the functioning of the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.890" offset="7142417">I'd really like to make two points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.075" offset="7151194">One is that even though, as Mrs. Vickers said, the school districts are often available as defendants in these cases, that is not in any event invariably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.668" offset="7209499">And so it's important that the same rule as to the availability of tuition reimbursement be... be applied against states as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.560" offset="7261117">And I also would like to show you that the Education of the Handicapped Act in 1975 did expressly waive states' immunity.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1792.950" offset="7306675">Well, it certainly didn't meet the kinds of requirements that Atascadero would have imposed, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martha_a_field" startTime="1800.537" stopTime="1993.345">
            <label>Ms. Martha A. Field</label>
            <text syncTime="1800.537" offset="7336977">Well, we think it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.406" offset="7348471">If Atascadero is read to require some particular formula of words, Congress acting ten years before Atascadero did not use any particular formula of words which it could not have anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.733" offset="7405835">But, in fact, the language of the 1975 EHA does constitute a clear statement that Congress intends to waive states' immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.522" offset="7440944">And it's much clearer than the statute involved in Atascadero was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.758" offset="7465917">Indeed, it's also clearer than Title VII, which this Court unanimously held in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer... did clearly and effectively abrogate states' immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.280" offset="7511997">In Atascadero, just to make that comparison, the Rehabilitation Act provision at issue said that any recipient of federal assistance should be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.241" offset="7575840">That phrase, "any recipient of federal assistance" did literally include states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.229" offset="7599769">It also, however, included many thousands of private companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.633" offset="7621398">The statute involved in Atascadero did not mention states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.835" offset="7638221">The EHA, the 1975 EHA, by contrast, mentions states more than 50 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.107" offset="7667269">More important than that, the only possible defendants under the EHA are states, and the school districts which they set up, control, and supervise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.748" offset="7713871">As the Petitioner itself stresses, under the EHA states are the only parties with ultimate responsibility for seeing that every child receives an appropriate education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.222" offset="7763713">In these circumstances, every member of Congress had to have been aware in enacting the EHA that its remedies would be enforceable against the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.697" offset="7809689">The language of the EHA... we're not relying on the legislative history, but the language of the statute itself... carries clear and unmistakable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.720" offset="7845737">This is the key fact that separates this case from Atascadero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.688" offset="7865591">The specific language that is helpful is not only the Section 1400 which Mrs. Vickers read from, but there are clear provisions in Section 1412 particularly, but also elsewhere in the statute, imposing duties upon the states, recognizing that states are the responsible party... indeed, are the only ultimately responsible party, and recognizing that states will directly provide the education in a good many situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.928" offset="7998606">And after that, Section 1415 expressly gives parents the opportunity to present a complaint with respect to any matter in a due process hearing with judicial review in state or federal court... this is by the parent against the state... for any appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.091" offset="8083243">So, there is clear language, although it may not be phrased exactly the way that Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.149" offset="8127442">I mean, I think Ms. Vickers made the point that until our Burlington decision it was not entirely clear that you could get an award for tuition reimbursement even against a school district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.874" offset="8174358">It's not... it's phrased in terms of appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.176" offset="8187524">I think Congress really rather wisely didn't spell out the bounds of appropriate relief in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.162" offset="8215527">One thing that is clear is that under the EHA many varied situations can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.233" offset="8235798">For example, your case last year in Honig v. Doe that Congress could not possibly have anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.620" offset="8261293">And courts, by devising appropriate relief and molding it to the facts of each particular case, can come up with more appropriate remedies than Congress could have thought about in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.095" offset="8315210">As this Court said in Burlington, appropriate relief does include reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.015" offset="8338929">We're not arguing that it includes money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.486" offset="8352826">It's not clear whether or not it includes money damages, though most lower courts have said in some situations it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.639" offset="8377382">But it's not necessary in this case to find that appropriate relief includes damages, but only reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.976" offset="8406743">And I believe in Burlington this Court drew the distinction between reimbursement and damages saying at least reimbursement was available under the EHA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2076.316" offset="8440075">Well, you agree, do you not, that reimbursement would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment if Congress had not sought to abrogate the immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.455" offset="8480722">What... what we are saying... we're certainly not asking you to alter Edelman v. Jordan, but we're simply saying that appropriate relief within the EHA includes reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.496" offset="8524817">One thing that is clear from the history of the EHA, both in 1975 and again in the 1986 Amendments, is Congress knew that in imposing this obligation upon the states that they were requiring states to spend money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.707" offset="8593675">That... that was absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.226" offset="8603811">And, indeed, the main... the main relevance of the 1986 EHA Amendments here which are not directly relevant because they concerned only attorney's fees... but they again showed that Congress was willing to require states to spend money to achieve appropriate education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.521" offset="8680924">The reason is that a though special education is expensive, it really is highly cost-effective And... for many... for many of the persons who receive special education under the EHA, it makes the difference whether they can function as productive and law-abiding citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.553" offset="8765039">So, I think this... this is the attitude which caused Congress to make the judgement that states should spend money for appropriate education if they opted to be included in this EHA program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.910" offset="11406541">The other disadvantage of the anti-reimbursement position is, of course, that it would leave parents and children without any effective means to obtain appropriate education during the period of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.720" offset="11461711">And it would create incentives for school districts to delay in meeting their obligations when the placement sought was an expensive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.409" offset="11496506">Children, then, would lose their right to education for as long as the decisionmaking process continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.329" offset="11524196">Because we think there is a clear statement in the EHA, it would be appropriate for this Court to uphold Mr. Muth's tuition reimbursement award for 1983 to '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.525" offset="11588980">And the Court really need not decide any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.077" offset="11607161">However, the Court either alternatively or additionally could rest affirmance on the ground that the courts below relied on, and that is the substantial procedural violations in the administrative process that was employed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.473" offset="11684797">The Act has rather strict time limitations, either 45 days or 75 days, depending which review scheme the state chooses to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.150" offset="11739445">In this case, the administrative process because of illegalities dragged out for more than a year longer than the strict time limitations in the Act allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.439" offset="11784585">Mr. Muth suffered serious harm as a result of that, as the court below found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.159" offset="11803497">For that reason we really are not talking about punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.461" offset="11820738">We don't think punitive damages would be appropriate relief under the EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.198" offset="11839651">We think we are talking neither about damages nor about something that was punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.169" offset="11863579">And so it would be appropriate for this Court to uphold the reimbursement award on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.006" offset="11890851">Even if you uphold it on that ground, it's not necessary to reach the partiality matter on which the... on which the state sought certiorari because the remand fully... fully justifies the reimbursement of remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.202" offset="12067648">If you find that there is abrogation, then Mr. Muth is entitled to reimbursement on either of two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.291" offset="12100040">One, the school district did not provide an appropriate education during the 1983 to '84 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.313" offset="12132118">There has been some attempt to create some factual disputes around whether an appropriate education was provided, but we're really quite happy with the statements of facts as it appears in the Petitioner's brief on page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.823" offset="12194185">They mention that the school district at the outset of the year came in with a plan for education which the hearing officer held was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.747" offset="12245803">Not necessarily inappropriate in its placement but inappropriate in the services that were offered to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.570" offset="12273179">The school district at that point wrote Mr. Muth a letter saying that they would not offer those services until the administrative review was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.358" offset="12312258">And the school district appealed from the award for those services, saying that it... saying that it really wasn't necessary for them to provide those services to the child at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.548" offset="12353009">It wasn't until April of 1984... when the school year in question here is 1983 to 1984... in April of 1984 the school district came up with an appropriate education plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.224" offset="12411733">A plan that was subsequently in July of '84 held to have been appropriate for the '83-84 school year if it had been put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.914" offset="12446528">But we don't think that the fact that on April 26th of the 1983-84 school year the school district then came up with an appropriate education plan should mean that during 1983 to 1984 it was all right to leave Alex without any appropriate education.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.192" offset="12927599">If you do, we think we... we hope that you would hold, as other courts have, that the EHA, unlike the conventional administrative scheme, does not permit the head of the agency to be the final administrative decisionmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.351" offset="12988307">Instead of relying on general principles of administrative law in enacting the EHA, the EHA created its own procedural scheme, which is really at the heart of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.492" offset="13032820">There's very little in the way of substantive requirements in the EHA.</text>
