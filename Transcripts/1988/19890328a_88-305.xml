            <text syncTime="7.320" offset="171093">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.189" offset="182587">This case presents an opportunity for the Court to revisit the role of the victim in capital sentencing proceedings and prevent further eroding of that role in the criminal justice equation of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.496" offset="235772">Particularly this case presents the narrow issue of whether the prosecutor's argument during the sentencing phase violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution when it focuses on the characteristics of the victim, as well as the defendant, rather than only the defendant when the characteristics are directly drawn from the evidence admitted at the trial and obvious to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.897" offset="337336">In September 1986, Richard Haynes, a 32 year old black male, was brutally beaten, his possessions ransacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="372445">He was sexually assaulted and murdered by Demetrius Gathers and his accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="393029">The beatings occurred at a city park when Hayres had gone to review religious materials that he had set out on the park bench when he was accosted for the first time in reckless disregard of his rights to free expression in practicing his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.535" offset="467949">In the sentencing phase, the prosecutor commented upon evidence that was admitted to the trial obvious to the jury from the guilt phase the victim was a religious person, that he was a registered voter, and he read from a prayer card in evidence referred to as the Game Guy's Prayer about a person wanting a fair chance in life and giving others that same fair chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.567" offset="560004">The Supreme Court of South Carolina, relying on this Court's decision in Booth, asserted that these comments on the personal characteristics of the defendant were not necessary for an understanding of the crime, and therefore violated the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.743" offset="624788">We submit that the Eighth Amendment was not violated by these prosecutor's comments and that the Eighth Amendment allows a jury in any capital punishment situation to have an understanding as to who the victim was and what he was doing at the time he was brutally murdered.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.289" offset="686959">The Eighth Amendment, we submit, does not preclude comments that are directly related.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.680" offset="3424487">It was introduced then into the penalty phase without objection by the defense attorney, and it wasn't until after the prosecution's closing argument that the defense attorney at that time suggested that the prayer card be removed from the... from going to the jury at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.875" offset="3497317">We submit the Eighth Amendment does not require a state to neutralize and redact the victim from the trial where properly admitted evidence reveals personal characteristics of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.469" offset="3547681">The evidence, we submit, is relevant to the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.503" offset="3563772">It's relevant to the information as to the particular moral culpability of the defendant by reflecting upon the person who he chose to kill on that particular date.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.394" offset="3607345">In capital cases the sentencer's attempt must be to make a unique and individualized judgment regarding the crime and regarding the penalty the defendant deserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.368" offset="3655305">The jury in any capital case is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the appropriate punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.356" offset="3687175">In this Court's decisions, it's clear that the defendant has virtually free rein to introduce anything in evidence that he considers mitigating to his particular factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.246" offset="3730747">If the defendant, under this Court's decisions, considered certain information to be relevant, its admissibility should be allowed to be introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.369" offset="3767214">The circumstances of the offense, we submit, must include who the victim was and what he was doing at the time the crime occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.458" offset="3803576">Here, unlike Booth, the comments did not focus on the reputation of the victim and the effect on his family, but rather on the circumstances of the crime over which the defendant could have had knowledge and control, the apparent selection and choice of a vulnerable victim in September of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.621" offset="3880272">To redact this information from the penalty phase would make Richard Haynes a mere abstraction, we submit, and at most this thumbnail sketch was presented of Richard Haynes gave the jury a quick glimpse of the life the defendant chose to extinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.048" offset="3942025">As the defense can humanize the defendant in any case, we submit the prosecution should equally be able to humanize the victim to allow for correct balance in the criminal justice process and the assessment of the offense from the victim's viewpoint, we submit, is germane to any jury's decision as to the appropriateness of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.562" offset="4028020">In this case concerns that Booth has as to whether this information can be guided were accomplished in this particular setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.667" offset="4060412">During the prosecution's closing argument, the solicitor advised the jury that the sympathy for the victim is not the way you make a determination as to the appropriateness of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.375" offset="4107328">You must focus on the characteristics of the defendant and the circumstances of the particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.362" offset="4131256">That is the direction the prosecutor was giving when he made his particular closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.814" offset="4152990">Further, the judge, when he gave his jury charge in this case, said that to make your determination, you should refer to the culpability of the defendant in his action involving the death and criminal sexual conduct of the victim, Richard Haynes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.477" offset="4227700">The trial judge further charged: you should not be swayed by prejudice, by passion, or by other bias or motive in the particular jury charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.333" offset="4267093">This information gave the jury a guided choice as to the utilization of this information and the determination as to the appropriateness of the penalty in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.021" offset="4309829">The concerns that Booth had of the effect of the murder on the victim's family, again, were not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.875" offset="4773242">But the situation in Booth, the factual situation the Court was presented with, is certainly not the situation we're presenting here to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.814" offset="4805007">That evidence went significantly beyond any relevancy that related to the circumstances of the crime or particularly the circumstances of the particular victim in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.205" offset="4850564">It put them in a vulnerable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.157" offset="4862372">In conclusion, we would submit that the Eighth Amendment does not preclude the types of the comments that were related to the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the defendant in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.632" offset="4916288">The prosecutor was merely attempting to humanize the victim and balance the... the sort of mitigating evidence that was presented in this case dealing with the entire background of the defendant, his relationship with his family members, his ability to be a rock to some family members and to be essentially a nonviolent and friendly person that was presented by those particular family members in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.532" offset="5019942">The vulnerability of the victim was the essence of the argument done this case, that the victim was just a member of society, an individual that had an identity was the attempted argument that the prosecutor was trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.827" offset="5089114">The use of this info conveys our common humanity with those who suffer from this sort of crime and keeps us from thinking of them as faceless abstractions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.232" offset="5218682">I'd like to draw the Court's attention to page 66... or excuse me... page 17 of the joint appendix concerning the testimony and the lighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.404" offset="5251387">Justice O'Connor, you asked was it likely that Mr. Gathers read this Game Guy's Prayer and the voter registration card prior to his committing these acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.510" offset="5295795">The question was:</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.712" offset="5300602">"What was the lighting like. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.762" offset="5304781">"Was it dark? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.545" offset="5307916">The answer is: "It was dark out there".</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.747" offset="5316798">So, it's very unlikely, I submit, that this individual stood there and read this card and began to formulate an intent to kill as a result of his knowledge that this man was a Christian and that he was a registered voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.940" offset="5373536">Also, I'd like to point out that in its presentation, the state has conceded that the voter registration card in this case was not relevant to a sentencing determination because it wasn't relevant to the circumstances of the crime or the characteristics of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.933" offset="5433513">And as we'll reach a little bit further in the argument, we would submit that the use of a voter registration card to invoke a death sentence from a sentence... a death sentence from a sentencing authority is a constitutionally impermissible basis for imposing a sentence of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.397" offset="9991358">But the position that the Respondent takes in the case is that because human life is valued equally in South Carolina under this statute, and because the status of the law at the time of this case, as reflected in the adoption of the statute back in 1977, if you look at the aggravating circumstances that the general assembly has adopted which permits... the presence of which permits the state to seek a death penalty, they have nothing to do with victims' characteristics because victims aren't valued equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.385" offset="10127299">We have other aggravating circumstances such as robbery, kidnapping, events of that sort that warrant the state seeking the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.176" offset="10166483">In fact, under South Carolina law I would submit that the state with the presence of aggravating circumstances is faced with a situation where the death penalty is warranted... is warranted but for the presence of certain mitigating circumstances which the sentencer in the case decides warrants the dispensing of mercy to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.243" offset="10274734">And for that reason, the status of the law... the Supreme Court in Gaskins, State v. Gaskins, held that victim's personal characteristics... the fact that Rudolph Tyner, who himself was a death row inmate in South Carolina, was killed while he resided on death row by Mr. Gaskins and the fact that he had confessed to prior murders was irrelevant when the decision came to be made about whether Mr. Gaskins was to live or to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.263" offset="10390822">And the sentence Imposed in Gaskins, of course, was... was the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.999" offset="10417780">Now, in its reply brief, the state argues that Gaskins is really unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.070" offset="10442022">We don't really know what the law is in South Carolina because that opinion is not clearly... doesn't clearly state the status of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.474" offset="10471697">But I would submit you ultimately have to look at the language in the Gathers' opinion where it cites Gaskins for the proposition that evidence of a victim's bad character is inadmissible in a sentencing phase trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.821" offset="10549020">I'd move on to the second point that the Respondent would like to make, and that is given the status of the law in South Carolina, there was really no mechanism there in place for us to challenge or rebut the evidence that the solicitor or the points the solicitor urged in his argument to test the accuracy and the reliability of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.455" offset="10651629">Now, Skipper v. South Carolina is a case that attorneys in South Carolina think is a very important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.942" offset="10685588">And, of course, the concurring opinion in Skipper talks about the need to be able to confront and test the reliability and the accuracy of information that's being used as a basis for a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.452" offset="10735638">And in South Carolina... of course, that case relies on Gardner v. Florida.</text>
