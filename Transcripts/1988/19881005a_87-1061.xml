            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139382">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 87-1061, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Jerry Tarkanian.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.668" offset="182014">Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="13.464" stopTime="102.959">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="13.464" offset="193194">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association's enforcement of its own standards, among its own members, is state action for Fourteenth Amendment and Section 1983 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.130" offset="255888">In the early 1970's, the NCAA began an investigation of certain alleged practices at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, some of which involved its basketball program.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.125" offset="303849">As is the case with all NCAA investigations, the primary responsibility for the investigation rests with the University, and both the University and the Association conducted their own investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.339" offset="352646">The Association's counsel ultimately affirmed some 38 of its Infractions Committee's findings of violations, 10 of which involved the Respondent, who had become the head coach after the time that the Association first received complaints about UNLV.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.924" offset="431013">As part of the prescribed remedy, UNLV was directed to show cause why three persons should not be suspended from coaching and any involvement with intercollegiate athletic activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.871" offset="502798">Those three persons were the former head coach, the Respondent, and an assistant coach.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.290" offset="524531">As for the former coach, the suspension was to be permanent, and as to the other two, the suspension was to be for two years.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="114.189" offset="596107">So the NCAA said in effect to UNLV,</text>
            <text syncTime="118.233" offset="612303">"You must suspend so-and-so for a certain period of time? "</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="122.139" offset="627872">Not quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.139" offset="631842">What it said was... it was an order to show cause why they should not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.605" offset="649710">And that is an important point, actually, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.635" offset="665906">Pursuant to that order to show cause, the President of the University assigned a Vice President as hearing officer, who held a hearing and then as a result of that hearing identified for the President three options that were available to the University, and according to the Hearing Officer's recommendation, those three options were the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="753364">The first was that the university could impose the recommended discipline, which would involve the two-year suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.997" offset="779278">A second was to refuse to do so, and according to the Hearing Officer, this ran the risk that the NCAA might impose other sanctions, some of which might be more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.104" offset="823790">And the third was to withdraw from NCAA membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.633" offset="837896">Faced with those choices, the University opted to impose the suspension, which has never been carried out, because of an injunction which was ultimately affirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court, whose state action holding is now before this Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.892" offset="906860">The Respondent does not contend... nor could he... that the NCAA itself is a governmental entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.777" offset="942386">Rather, his argument--</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="256.694" offset="1166099">Well, because the judgment that would ultimately come out of the court would necessarily have an important effect... after all, it was our determination that that was the appropriate remedy for the violation of our rules.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="272.578" stopTime="288.869">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="272.578" offset="1229629">Well, it's a little strange to be arguing in a way that NCAA was a necessary party to the action, and yet should not be considered in any way as State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.917" offset="1286993">Is there any tension there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="288.869" offset="1294830">No, no, I think not, because of what this Court said in 1982 about what are the standards for determining state action, and they are not the same standards as for determining whether a party is indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.442" offset="1345090">And those two... there are two requirements, that this Court announced in Lugar v. Edmonson Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.580" offset="1365674">The first is that you look to the substantive rule that is being enforced in the particular case and inquire into whether that rule has its source in some State authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.216" offset="1420218">The second is whether there is sufficient interlinking, intermeshing, between them.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="325.777" offset="1442474">Do you think that Lugar was intended to be the definitive statement of how we determine state action in all cases, even those of perhaps delegation or joint participation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="338.223" stopTime="343.331">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="338.223" offset="1492211">Well, of course, Justice O'Connor, you know much about... much more about what the Court had intended.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="343.331" offset="1512691">Well, you're arguing that that is now the definitive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.487" offset="1521260">I'm not sure that I can read Lugar that way, and I'm not sure whether those tests should be applied in all situations of delegation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="356.514" stopTime="400.261">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="356.514" offset="1565354">In our argument, is that they should.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.246" offset="1580296">Maybe not or its face... it appears to say all cases, and it announced two requirements, and it said that the difference between the two requirements are demonstrated... is demonstrated by two of the Court's landmark cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.755" offset="1654380">Moose Lodge, which demonstrates the rule of decision, or the rule of conduct, requirement, and Flagg Brothers, which demonstrates the State actor requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.735" offset="1694295">And both of those, of course, reach far beyond the context in Lugar, and far beyond the context in this case, and therefore in our view it is a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.387" offset="1732851">But you don't have to go that far... excuse me.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="400.261" offset="1740375">Well, what if NCAA said, for example, we want drug testing of all participating athletes on a regular basis, and you either do that, or you run the risk of the school being dropped out of the NCAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.645" offset="1801919">Now, is there any... do we have exactly the same kind of an issue that we have here?</text>

            <text syncTime="423.534" offset="1833475">If, as I suggested, the first line of defense, Lugar applies across the board for all cases, then it would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.889" offset="1870882">But I... in any event, those two tests, and particularly the first one, ought to apply in a case such as this, and here is why.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.214" offset="1904215">Even if it is not the principled, of the two-part, across the board test in all cases that we take, at the very least, when the sole issue in the case is whether a particular rule of conduct has been violated, as it has in this case... the NCAA's standards for eligibility and recruitment... then, at the very least when that's the sole, ultimate issue in the case, then one of the relative inquiries, on a case-by-case approach... one of the most important inquiries... ought to be whether the rule of conduct in that particular case had a governmental source or a non-governmental source.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.075" offset="5331584">Let me just say that there are, in addition to the legal reasons that neither one of the Lugar tests, neither the rule of conduct issue nor the joint participation issue has been satisfied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.568" offset="5397622">There are good reasons why the state action rules should not apply to the NCAA's enforcement of its own rules among its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.328" offset="5444642">This Court said four years ago that the NCAA plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports, and there can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.761" offset="5502425">This is the classic case that illustrates both that critical role and why it needs ample latitude in order to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.991" offset="5539310">The procedures that it follows place principal responsibility, or divide the responsibility for enforcement, as between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.411" offset="5572956">It is not a strictly adversarial kind of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.612" offset="5589779">What the NCAA has concluded over the years is that it can best be done by a combination of cooperation and adversarialness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.888" offset="5622902">And the accomplishment... that ample latitude that this Court observed that the Association needs to carry out its critical role... will be aided by leaving this area of associational freedom continually available to the NCAA so that it can make its own judgments as to how best to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.115" offset="5711823">The key to decision, I submit, to this case, is to distinguish rather carefully between what the NCAA does on the one hand and what the University did on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.610" offset="5769815">What the NCAA did was to set its own standards for conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.246" offset="5796355">Because they were the NCAA's standards and not the University's standards, the first of the Lugar requirements has not been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.435" offset="5945044">As the Lugar opinion says, they really aren't the same.</text>
