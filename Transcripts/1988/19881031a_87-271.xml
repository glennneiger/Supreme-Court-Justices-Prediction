            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="12.549" offset="193693">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.502" offset="205500">This case involves a legal question under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of whether a reasonable jury on the basis of the entire record in this case could find that Respondent was laid off and not recalled because of his age.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.153" offset="272060">Since the court below reversed the District Court's grant of Petitioner's motion for summary judgment, it is first appropriate to review the facts underlying this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.248" offset="312498">Petitioner Harbison-Walker provides technology and specialized refractory products to high-temperature natural resource industries, the largest of which is the steel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.776" offset="358578">As the business fortunes of the steel industry declined in the early eighties, so did the business fortunes of Harbison-Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.782" offset="386581">Between 1980 and 1982 Harbison's employment was reduced from approximately 5,400 employees to 2,700 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.748" offset="426496">In 1982 sales declined some 31 percent, the posted and net operating loss of $21 million or $20.5 million, and employment in that year alone was reduced 38 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.375" offset="476965">In making decisions as to which groups of employees would be laid off, Harbison considered among other things length of service and the skills necessary to perform work in a reduced work environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.945" offset="535270">Among the employees hardest hit by the downturn were those working in the company's iron and steel marketing group.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.580" offset="565781">Within that group were four installation specialists.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.482" offset="581455">Respondent who at the time of this action was aged 55 with 17 years of service; Mr. Malarich, aged 59 with approximately 16 years of service; Mr. Faust, aged 39 with approximately 16 years of service; and Mr. Meixell, aged 59 with approximately two and one half years of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.368" offset="676958">Because of a substantial reduction in shipments, Petitioner elected in early July 1982 to lay off, among others, two of its installation specialists, the Respondent who was 55 years old, and Mr. Meixell, who was 59 but was the least senior of the installation specialists.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.491" offset="761491">Petitioner retained the 59-year-old, Mr. Malarich, and the 39-year-old, Mr. Faust, because they possessed more diverse or versatile skills and had higher job performance evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.571" offset="817811">Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old, had previously worked for Petitioner as a sales correspondent, and his work duties included pricing and margin work, which work he continued to perform after he became an installation specialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.330" offset="876847">The skills of pricing and margin work were skills that Respondent concedes and the courts below found he did not have and would require training to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.848" offset="918852">Faust had before his--</text>

            <text syncTime="196.860" offset="930973">Mr. Kramer, when you say, "The courts below found", this came up on summary judgment, so you're obligated, of course, to take the facts against you--</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="207.927" offset="975172">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.708" offset="978307">The courts noted that there was no record evidence to support the assertion, Mr. Chief Justice, that Mr. Brieck, the Respondent in this case, had performed that work while employed at Harbison, and there is an affidavit at pages 52 and 53 in the record from the Respondent himself in which he concedes that, in fact, those were jobs that he had not performed but, to the extent he had not, he could be easily trained to perform them.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.766" offset="1094500">Prior to the layoffs in question, Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old, had spent approximately 60 percent of his time doing office work and 40 percent of his time doing installation work outside of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.946" offset="1159283">Business conditions worsened.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.130" offset="1167956">In late July of 1982, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year-old, was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.544" offset="1193660">Three months later, Mr. Faust himself, was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.424" offset="1209229">In the spring of 1983, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year old, was recalled, first on a temporary and then on a permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.932" offset="1255205">In the summer of 1983, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year-old, at that time approximately approaching 60, indicated to Petitioner that he was going to elect to retire that fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.771" offset="1306614">At that time Petitioner recalled Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.974" offset="1327407">After his recall Mr. Faust in deposition testimony stated he performed approximately 75 percent of his work doing installation work outside the office, 25 percent doing office work, an undetermined amount of which was pricing and margin work.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.618" offset="1405984">Of the 12 individuals laid off from Petitioner's iron and steel marketing group between July and November 1982, 75 percent were under the age of 40, and one of the three who was over the age of 40 who was laid off, was subsequently recalled, Mr. Malarich.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.891" offset="1491038">Of the 21 remaining employees after the layoffs took place, over half were over the age of 40 and over half of that group were over the age of 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.949" offset="1535238">Within two weeks or... yeah, within two weeks, excuse me, of his July layoff, Respondent filed the charge of age discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.273" offset="1572540">Approximately two years later, he filed the lawsuit challenging among other things his layoff and his failure to recall on the basis of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.541" offset="1613605">Full-scale discovery commenced, and Harbison subsequently moved the District Court for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.296" offset="1640668">The District Court granted this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.978" offset="1651430">The District Court found first in a reduction-in-force case there is not an onerous burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and, in fact, found that a prima facie case was made solely because of the fact that Respondent was 55 years old at the time of his layoff and had been qualified to be an installation specialist.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.814" offset="1814748">And, in fact, at that time in light of Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, the burden of production then shifted to my client to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.691" offset="1862291">The District Court found that this was satisfied since, in fact, three of the five years before the layoff the Petitioner had rated Mr. Faust higher than the Respondent and that, in fact, there was no doubt that Mr. Faust possessed the diverse skills that Respondent or that Petitioner contended it was going to use as one of its guides as to who would be laid and who would be recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.516" offset="1953510">The District Court then went on to reject Respondent's effort to show that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.110" offset="12031969">Well, seniority, a jury could reasonably conclude that an employer meant what it said and its seniority meant seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.386" offset="12437076">Respondent has come forth with evidence that he was the only one of all these installation specialists who had ever been sent out on international assignments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.053" offset="12779698">They attempted to introduce statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.285" offset="12788580">Well, the statistics will show that three out of five people aged 55 or over, that is, 60 percent, were laid off in July 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.354" offset="12844900">A hundred percent of them were not permanently recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.328" offset="12860782">So, I think there are plenty of issues of fact in this particular case under this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.390" offset="12881053">We request that the Court affirm the decision of the Third Circuit and remand for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.846" offset="12922849">Just quickly, Your Honors, the issue here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that there was age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.710" offset="12950330">We would submit you have to look at the entire record and the facts from which the Court of Appeals inferred that a jury could determine age discrimination was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.488" offset="12989409">They took one particular piece of evidence, held it up to a probative value that can't rise to any inference in light of the entire record of age discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.735" offset="13034444">It is involving two important principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.916" offset="13043117">The court below said you could look at one piece of evidence and not the entire record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.618" offset="13061925">As a dissent of the court below said, that was inconsistent with this Court's opinion in Anderson and in Celotex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.565" offset="13085749">Number two, the standard that the Court would apply into the ADA is one which really does not deal with the ultimate question of discrimination, but simply whether or not you can raise a sufficient question of the judgment itself so as to allow a jury then to infer discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.337" offset="13164847">The question presented is set forth in your petition is whether a plaintiff who alleges intentional discrimination can survive summary judgment merely... merely by questioning his employer's business judgment without presenting any evidence, direct or indirect, that his employer's judgment was, in fact, motivated by an intent to discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.239" offset="13244469">That's an interesting question.</text>
