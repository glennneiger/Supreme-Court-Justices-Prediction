            <text syncTime="14.058" offset="178441">Today this Court is asked to decide whether an Indian tribe is answerable in state court for ignoring its obligation to collect and remit taxes to the State of Oklahoma despite this Court's sanction of state laws imposing such obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.352" offset="243538">The Tax Commission brought this action in state district court to enjoin the Chickasaw Nation from operating a motel business until all taxes were collected and remitted to the state in compliance with state tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="311456">The tribe removed this case to the federal court, and that court denied the state's motion to remand on the basis that a suit against an Indian tribe is a federal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.288" offset="359312">After assuming jurisdiction, the federal court then dismissed the state's case holding that an Indian tribe cannot be sued without its consent under the Indian sovereignty doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="418036">In affirming these decisions, the Tenth Circuit ruled that an Indian tribe enjoys absolute sovereign immunity within its territory and thereby foreclosed the state's right to have its valid taxes collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.474" offset="480103">The first question we ask this Court to consider is whether removal jurisdiction exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.228" offset="507061">The state submits that federal removal jurisdiction does not exist because the state's lawsuit is not based on federal law to any extent, but only alleges violations of state law to which the Tax Commission requests relief provided by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.541" offset="584383">The respondent urges that its status as an Indian tribe creates a federal cause of action that is properly removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.795" offset="617402">However, this Court has held in the Mescalero Apache Tribe opinion in 1973 that the federal government does not have exclusive jurisdiction over an Indian tribe for all purposes and that the encouragement for tribal economic development under the Indian Reorganization Act does not establish a tribal business as an arm of the government and, therefore, off reservation activity is within the reach of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.297" offset="731401">But the heart of the matter is that the Tax Commission's complaint properly pleads a cause of action to collect state taxes which is based exclusively on state law, as it must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.974" offset="786049">The tribe may raise substantial federal questions in defense of the state's claim, but federal questions in a defensive argument cannot serve as a basis for federal removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.484" offset="848116">Under the well pleaded complaint rule, a federal statute or a substantial question of federal law must be the basis of the plaintiff's claim rather than a basis of the defendant's defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.660" offset="904854">And, therefore, this case should be remanded to the state district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.295" offset="923348">But beyond the issue of removal jurisdiction, this case concerns whether the Indian sovereignty doctrine bars the state's lawsuit.</text>

I feel that the state's interest could be fulfilled by the tribe's Business enterprise, and the tribe could fulfill their interests in the economic development of their business because the state tax will not prevent the tribe from sustaining their economic development, just as it does not prevent all other businesses from making a profit in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.465" offset="6748027">The state cannot... I've said this before, but we just don't see how the state can create the right in itself to assert these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.997" offset="6842173">In this case we believe that the petition inherently asserts the right to limit aspects of the Chickasaw Nation's sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.857" offset="6897552">In National Farmers Insurance Company versus Crow Tribe, the court said in that case where the complaint asserts the right to curtail or limit a tribe's or aspects of a tribe's sovereignty, that it arises out of federal law for purposes of 13... Section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.507" offset="7004236">And, of course, the test for 1331 and the removal test under 1441 are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.263" offset="7039241">But, in any event, we contend that... that the complete preemption rule applies here because the... the... the Congress has completely dominated and indicated its intent to govern the field of tribal sovereign immunity and state civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.497" offset="7148119">With regard to the area of state civil jurisdiction the Congress has allowed the states to have jurisdiction with great care and selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.173" offset="7202872">In 1953 the... and incidentally, the Congress has shown that it knows how to grant the states civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.613" offset="7240592">In 1953 an example would be Public Law 280 and its 1968 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.267" offset="7267237">In Wold Engineering versus Three Tribes the... this Court described Public Law 280 as a comprehensive and detailed scheme, the primary expression of federal policy and that it preempts incompatible state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.513" offset="7352187">Oklahoma is not a Public Law 280 state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.232" offset="7367129">Certainly the attempt by the Oklahoma Tax Commission to assert state court civil jurisdiction over an Indian tribe in that... in that state is incompatible with Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.658" offset="7420837">Another example of... when Congress has allowed civil jurisdiction over Indian tribes is the Termination Acts of 1954, making certain tribes subject to the laws of the states at the time they terminated those tribes' federal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.638" offset="7500772">Congress has also exhibited a... a... its domination in the area of whether or not tribal sovereign immunity is abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.231" offset="7563048">It has shown that it will only abrogate tribal sovereign immunity, again, with great care and very infrequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.669" offset="7596798">As it relates to the Chickasaw Nation, we know of only three times that it specifically has abrogated the Chickasaw Nation's sovereign immunity, and that would be in the Curtis Act of 1898... there was a limited abrogation there... the Five Tribes Act of 1906, where it allowed certain counterclaims and actions that were... that were pending where the tribes were... were plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.389" offset="7715707">In Public law 93-195 in 1975 when the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and the Cherokee Nations were allowed to sue each other to determine the respective ownerships of the Arkansas River beds, as related to the Indian tribes generally, the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 allows for habeas corpus relief only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.506" offset="7828243">Recently in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 the Congress allowed certain actions arising out of the compacts that... that states and tribes might enter into to be the subject of suits against tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.902" offset="7893758">Moreover, Congress has reemphasized its commitment to tribal sovereign immunity in the Indian Self-determination Act of 1975 where it said that there was nothing in that act should be construed as affecting, modifying, diminishing, or otherwise impairing the sovereign immunity from suit enjoyed by Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.035" offset="7998352">Another federal area in which state law is completely displaced is the treaties that the United States government has entered into with the Chickasaw Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.129" offset="8058643">In 1832 the preamble of the... of that treaty with the Chickasaw Nation showed that the principal consideration for removal was to escape state laws which oppressed the Chickasaw Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.340" offset="8131577">In 1834 when the Chickasaw Nation finally did agree to remove, the principal consideration that the tribe advanced in that matter was, again, to escape state laws, and the federal government promised to protect them from inroads from the whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.437" offset="8219871">In 1837 the Choc... the Chickasaws acquired their present reservation from the Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.661" offset="8260831">That treaty provided that the Chickasaws would hold that reservation on the same terms and conditions as the Choctaws held it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.850" offset="8297611">The Choctaws acquired that reservation under the Treaty to Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830, and when they acquired those lands, the United States government promised them that they would not allow any state to pass laws for the tribe or its descendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.263" offset="8579211">Finally, Oklahoma's Enabling Act conditioned its becoming a state on its disclaiming any jurisdiction to limit the rights of persons or property pertaining to the Indians of said territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.654" offset="8628739">We think that the decisions of this Court, the active involvement of the Congress, and these treaty rights completely preempt the state law cause of action asserted by the State of Oklahoma here, and that this case was properly removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.485" offset="8716093">Of course, the trial court dismissed this case because there was no affirmative showing of a waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity, but... and we think that the court was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.398" offset="8787773">Perhaps it would have been more correctly decided had it determined what the state court's jurisdiction was for purposes of determining whether or not there was derivative jurisdiction that was necessary at the time this case was removed, prior to the 1986 amendment of the removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.693" offset="8864991">And had it done that, we feel that it would have determined that the state court did not have jurisdiction and that dismissal, as was mandated by Lambert Run Coal Company versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad mandated dismissal as opposed to remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2249.766" offset="9121200">And as I understand the decision in Colville and Moe and Chamenuevi that this Court has only held that the tribes are required to collect those taxes as they relate to non-tribal members, certainly my client does not believe that it has a right to... to defy this Court's decision in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.047" offset="10154395">Perhaps... perhaps I've misinterpreted what the Court has said there, but the way I interpreted that decision was that in that case, in spite of the fact that the complaint only alleged a state law cause of action... and that's what the Court said there, that it only alleged a state law cause of action in ejectment... the underlying right to assert that was based on federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.189" offset="10314891">Is that the case in which the complaint alleged a violation of the Non-Intercourse Act, the federal statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.415" offset="10383854">Except in that case the Court said that there was no federal statute which made New York's statutory or decisional law applicable to an Indian tribe and, therefore, the governing rule of law would be fashioned in the mode of the federal common law, as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.415" offset="10499838">I think I have correctly quote that from the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.052" offset="10522408">But we still submit that... that anytime the state sues a federally recognized Indian tribe asserting these rights that it... that's been asserted here, that it... it raises issues that are completely preempted by federal law.</text>
