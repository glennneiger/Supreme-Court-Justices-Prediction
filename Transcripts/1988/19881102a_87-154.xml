            <text syncTime="55.979" offset="375385">I would suggest that there are two primary elements to the one and only one circumstance for which we argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.954" offset="415300">The first is the existence of a child/parent relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.887" offset="431078">The other is what I term enmeshment, intricate intimacy, enmeshment of the agents of the state in a particular circumstance which would have three characteristics: the first, an extreme danger to a particular individual child; the second, abundant actual knowledge on the part of the agents of the state; and the third, an actual undertaking by the state to protect the child.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="107.441" offset="581230">You derive all this from the language of the due process clause?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald James Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="111.023" offset="595650">Indeed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.514" offset="601606">We think it arises from that and from the nature of the relationship and from the way the Court has... has accorded the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.078" offset="627832">If I may... if I may explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.670" offset="634206">It is my view... it is our view that the protector of the child, the raiser of the child, the person with the right and the power and the authority and the duty to educate the child, teach the child, provide medical care, all those parental things, including setting bedtime, is the parent and not the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.145" offset="716126">The... the other side of that coin is that there is one and only one circumstance where when the family unit... and I don't care whether it's a married family or a step-parent or whatever, but when the child is at home and the door is closed to the world, the people with whom that child is locked in, his natural and his inherent protectors, from those individuals alone, whether it's a father, a step-mother, a live-in girlfriend of what have you... from those protectors alone he has no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.657" offset="862099">And in that one and only one circumstance, I think that's appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.291" offset="880698">And I would further respond to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.803" offset="894699">It is only in that one circumstance, as I understand the cases... it is only in that one circumstance that the Court has already interposed any aspect of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.502" offset="949557">And I don't want that changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.073" offset="959797">I don't ask that that be applied to a different circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.834" offset="970872">What I'm saying is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.946" offset="975261">Take the situation where the child is locked behind the door with his protector and the protector becomes the predator, and a proceeding is brought at the extreme end of the child protection spectrum to terminate the parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.518" offset="1045583">The Court has already said that the Constitution governs that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.908" offset="1063137">The Court has already recognized it in the relationship between the adult and the child that the Constitution prevails and it prevails both substantively and procedurally.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.126" offset="1108068">What I mean is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.758" offset="1114546">We know that any parent has a constitutionally recognized right to the... if I may simplify it, to the possession of the child, care, custody, companionship, all those... all those kinds of things that go with being a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.057" offset="1171702">We also know that that right of parenthood cannot be terminated except by procedural due process protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.302" offset="1204721">So, I'm saying to the Court that in that most intimate relationship, the Court has already recognized that the Constitution has application.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.510" offset="1245576">The Court additionally has recognized, I believe, that a child... indeed, any of us... has a constitutionally protected right to physical integrity, to bodily protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.186" offset="1416312">Now, certainly we've held in many cases that the state may not deprive someone of life, but we've never held that that provision protects in the constitutional sense a private... a private attack on another person.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.259" offset="1484544">And I would further agree that in the... in the context in which prior to today that question has been addressed by the Court, I agree that that's the correct holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.605" offset="1517981">For example, if you were to hold otherwise, then the police department would have an obligation to prevent the mugging and a whole host of things that are simply unworkable and are not to be found in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.941" offset="1563330">What I... what I'm suggesting to you is that, first of all, this is a question in the most intimate relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.415" offset="1585168">That has not been addressed, to my knowledge, by the Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.036" offset="1595617">And I think that it's consistent with the nature of the circumstance that we're dealing with, and I think it's consistent with the other constitutional applications the Court has afforded to the child/parent relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.526" offset="2441671">I understand Daniels and Davidson... again, to simplify in... in paraphrasing... to say even if you're negligent, it's okay in a 1983 setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.223" offset="2488378">And the Court reserved for another occasion... I think this may well be the occasion... the... the question of something more aggravated than... than negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.239" offset="2524427">But what I'm saying is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.291" offset="2528711">In the whole range of state action dealing with children, all conduct that is... let's assume that we can recognize some standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.541" offset="2581687">All conduct that is negligent is not actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.610" offset="2593912">And it has never been in contest that if we had the circumstance where the police officer or the child protection worker or someone else were inflicting a beating... you know, that's not the kind of case we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.148" offset="2636126">And the next topic, obviously, that we have to address is the question of whether it's gross negligence, deliberate indifference or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.711" offset="2662353">So, I... I respectfully and very strongly suggest that it's not a question of do we guess wrong at our peril.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.100" offset="7183940">We believe this case involves an attempt by the Petitioners to transform the private wrongdoing of a natural father into state action for purposes of invoking the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.979" offset="7235454">The primary issue presented is whether a county's failure to prevent the infliction of harm by a third party upon a person at liberty constitutes a due process violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.998" offset="7291460">We believe that there was no state deprivation of a constitutionally protected right for three main reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.086" offset="7331898">First, the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of liberty does not include a right to basic protective services from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.821" offset="7366797">Secondly, there is no state action in a constitutional sense which caused a deprivation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.116" offset="7400025">Third, we believe that the actions of the social worker did not evince the state of mind necessary to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.173" offset="7440254">In addition, we believe that there are two independent reasons for urging affirmance of the Seventh Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.257" offset="7476512">First, with respect to the municipal Respondents, there was no policy or custom which led to a deprivation and with respect to the individual Respondents, we believe they are clearly entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.651" offset="7554148">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.820" offset="7558745">It seems to us that what Petitioners are attempting to do is use Section 1983, on one hand, and the Fourteenth Amendment on the other hand to affirmatively compel the states to act to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.540" offset="7617677">Yet, in analyzing the... the legislative history and intent of Section 1983, it's quite clear that the statute was not designed for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.760" offset="7662608">Section 1983 is remedial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.862" offset="7682984">Therefore, we must look to the... the constitutional right that the Petitioners seek to invoke by way of use of Section 1983, which brings us precisely to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.870" offset="7730944">The Fourteenth Amendment has been viewed by this Court as imposing no constitutional duty upon the states to provide substantive services to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.327" offset="7784861">The Court also has held that if the state chooses to provide some form of protective services, the Fourteenth Amendment does not tell the state how far they must go in providing those services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.556" offset="7953717">In that instance, I believe we may well have a case somewhat analogous to the prison setting and perhaps more analogous to the mental institution setting that was present in Youngberg v. Romeo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.316" offset="10536809">And, in fact, I might note that Randy DeShaney, the father, was in fact a party defendant to this action when it was first... when the complaint was first filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.765" offset="10586546">He was subsequently dismissed on a voluntary basis by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.337" offset="10604832">So, he was in fact a party defendant, and there was no objection on the basis of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.622" offset="10626043">Again, we wish to emphasize that the problem with this special relationship or enmeshment theory is that it fails to distinguish between privately inflicted harm and state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.142" offset="10696051">On the other hand, we believe that the Court's adherence to the traditional state action or constitutional deprivation requirement provides a bright line standard which would separate actions of private wrongdoing from actions which can fairly or truly be attributed to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.685" offset="10774210">We also believe that the Petitioners cannot prevail upon their Fourteenth Amendment claim because the social workers in this case did not evince the state of mind necessary to support a Fourteenth Amendment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.558" offset="10845785">This Court has recently told us in Daniels and Davidson that negligence certainly is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.552" offset="10877759">And the Court also indicated to us that traditionally the due process clause has been applied to deliberate decisions by government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.181" offset="10936273">This case we believe is even less constitutionally compelling than Daniels and Davidson because we are not dealing with a custodial setting, and we are faced with claims of inaction versus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.342" offset="10996877">In such circumstances, we have proposed that the requisite state of mind must be that of deliberate indifference or a failure to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.892" offset="11043062">And the reason we propose this heightened state of mind requirement is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.327" offset="11068871">First, we believe it avoids trivializing the Constitution by allowing individuals to bring ordinary tort claims in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.685" offset="11110249">And we also believe that this heightened state of mind requirement recognizes the real-life dilemma which front-line social workers and many other governmental workers face on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.522" offset="11161553">As the Seventh Circuit indicated below, social workers truly do operate on a razor's edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.030" offset="11203663">First, a social worker must respect the constitutional rights of a parent to the care, custody and management of their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.418" offset="11253191">Secondly, where a social worker's involvement is on a purely voluntary basis, such as it was in this particular case, she must walk a fine line to avoid having the door slammed in her face thereby preventing any future involvement of the department.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.257" offset="12332570">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.053" offset="12367679">I want to address the... the due process... the deprivation of due process analysis briefly if I could, but before I do, I'd like to say a few words about the relationship between federal and state government and the role of the federal Constitution because I think it is reasonably clear that the area of child protection is not one that is crying out for federal constitutional oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.371" offset="12469034">First of all, it is not an area where there is any sort of history of hostility between the state and the interests that we're talking about trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.286" offset="12636636">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.209" offset="12516368">There being no constitutional right to this protection in the first place, it's clear I think that the state programs that have been set up have all been set up as a matter of state and local government initiative born of exactly the same sentiments and concerns that everyone feels toward children who are exposed to the kinds of abuse and hazards that we're sadly reviewing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.033" offset="12607692">So, we don't have... we don't have a... a state actor who there is a need to step in front of and stop in any sort of habitual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.057" offset="12639770">The state is actively intervening to do all that it reasonably can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.501" offset="12657534">Second of all, I think there's no reason to think that federal oversight, federal constitutional oversight, is going to add very much to the handling of these sensitive and difficult problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.198" offset="12700270">There is I think little reason to think that federal courts have any special expertise in the reviewing of what is at least in some sense a balance between interests of parents, respect for the interest of parents in controlling their children, as opposed to the priority of intervening when you... when you need to and must in order to protect the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.174" offset="12788250">It's the kind of a sensitive situation that requires close, on-the-scene involvement, the exercise of discretion and the exercise of a great deal of care and concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.871" offset="12834957">It's an area of... of traditional state law involvement and local government handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.284" offset="12860662">And the idea that at a federal court review engrafted on top of what is already in place, machinery that has been put in place by the state and local governments... the idea that that is going to help rather than hurt I think is... is really a misguided one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.105" offset="12915937">We're talking about a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.177" offset="12928267">We're talking about, number one, creating another layer of judicial action, judicial review, which itself will result in delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.713" offset="12958360">It will divert resources from the... the real everyday problems and the handling of these personal situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.848" offset="12982915">We are talking possibly not only about awarding damages and creating a... a chill and a discouraging factor which Justice O'Connor alluded to being involved at all, also a day-to-day possible, I suppose, injunctive role for the federal courts coming involved not only after the fact when something has happened to award damages, but becoming involved as these cases evolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.022" offset="13075597">You go to the local court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.284" offset="13080613">You go to your local social service agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.066" offset="13091793">You go to the local court, and then you go to federal court.</text>
