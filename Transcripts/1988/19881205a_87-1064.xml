            <text syncTime="11.497" offset="184676">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.229" offset="199513">This is a proceeding to enforce Internal Revenue summonses for bank records in a bank in Bellingham, Washington, that reflect accounts of two Canadian nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.238" offset="263565">The summonses were issued pursuant to a request by Canada under a tax treaty between Canada and the United States that provides, among other things, for exchanges of information to assist each other in the administration of their tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.480" offset="352591">The United States has such treaties in force currently with 34 countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.273" offset="383729">They're collected in Footnote 17 on page &lt;forty-one&gt; [= 41] of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.536" offset="412777">And these treaties play an important role in the Internal Revenue Service's broad authority to investigate compliance with our Internal Revenue laws by providing the IRS, through reciprocal exchanges with foreign source information that would not otherwise be available to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.134" offset="519147">The two most pertinent articles of the treaty are set forth at the beginning of the appendix to our brief on, on page 1A of the appendix following page 48 of our brief, and the Court will note that Article XIX provides that the competent authorities, the executive branch officials designated to administer the treaties, will exchange information that is at their disposal or that they are in a position to obtain, and information may be exchanged directly between the competent authorities of the two contracting states.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.271" offset="715693">And Article XXI says that the Commissioner may upon request furnish our treaty partner with information that the Commissioner is entitled to obtain under the revenue laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.075" offset="790925">These are fairly typical, and they obviously contemplate in appropriate cases, the use of process to obtain records that are not already in the possession of the tax authorities in each state and, indeed, the legislative history of the particular treaty involved here, as we set forth on page 29 of our brief, shows that during the confirmation process, and that's in footnote 11 and the accompanying text, it was contemplated in the Senate that a process such as an Internal Revenue summons would be used to secure information for each treaty partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.913" offset="1010249">And the specific reference that was made there was to the obtaining of bank records.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="263.550" offset="1192898">So, how can you say that you're in a position to obtain it under our revenue laws when you're not seeking to ascertain United States tax liability?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="271.486" offset="1224558">--That is a... certainly a possible reading of 7602, and that very question was debated and decided in the 1975 Second Circuit case that we have cited in our brief, United States against A. L. Burbank Company, in which this court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.445" offset="1320480">The contention was made there that the summons authority conferred by Congress was not sufficiently broad to obtain information of, of... regarding compliance with the treaty partner's revenue laws, notwithstanding the broader perspective that I tried to give the court that this... looked at overall becomes a means of getting reciprocal information that the IRS could not otherwise get about compliance with the American tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.617" offset="1457152">And the Second Circuit held in that case that 7602 should not be interpreted more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.974" offset="1490589">Not only old this Court deny certiorari, but Congress since has amended 7602 without disturbing that provision, and a large number of these treaties have since been entered into in presumed reliance on this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.386" offset="1572196">At the time of the Burbank decision, the Second Circuit stated that there were 19 such treaties then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.961" offset="1610543">There are now 34 such treaties in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.507" offset="1624649">So, the Burbank decision, we submit, was not only a correct interpretation at the time, but it has built into the fabric of the law and as, in many other instances, if possible, a statute should be interpreted in a way that helps to effectuate the purposes of a treaty, which is also the supreme law of the land.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="479.291" offset="2055774">Because the government still has information that it can furnish.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="482.822" offset="2069985">It has information, although a similar argument could be made about the Service's authority to conduct any investigation or engage in any operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.272" offset="2115751">It's all part of Chapter 78 of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes Chapter 7602.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.971" offset="2150547">And, of course, all authority that the Service has to investigate is replete with references to our revenue laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.216" offset="2191507">So, I'd have to say that a similar argument could be made about furnishing any information under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.243" offset="2223585">That a question could be raised about the Service's statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.399" offset="2244274">So, the summons question is not unique in that respect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="534.302" stopTime="539.831">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="534.302" offset="2275830">Did the Ninth Circuit expressly consider the summons question in its opinion in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="539.831" stopTime="914.648">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="539.831" offset="2297982">It did not expressly discuss this question, but it accepted the holding in the Burbank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.483" offset="2324627">Its, its holding is that a summons can be used for this purpose if the Service complies with the requirement that it added with respect to a... an analog to a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.290" offset="2391813">So, implicit in its holding is acceptance of the Burbank decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.489" offset="2428594">And, indeed, one could argue that in the absence of a cross-petition, that question is not open because it would change the relief in a manner more favorable to the Respondents here, because the Ninth Circuit ordered a remand that does not preclude enforcement of the summons if that condition can be compiled with by the Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.741" offset="2561609">So, as a technical matter, the question really is not open before the court in this case, but we do submit that the Burbank decision is part of the fabric of the law now that should not be repudiated by this court, and, and it it plays an important role in our foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.199" offset="2663487">What the Court of Appeals did do in this case was put itself in conflict with a later 1983 Second Circuit decision called United States against Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Company by holding; that is, the Ninth Circuit's holding, that the supporting affidavits in this case did not make a prima facie showing that the summonses were issued for a legitimate purpose because they failed to state that the Canadian investigation had not reached a stage analogous to referral to the U.S. Justice Department for a, a, a grand jury investigation or for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.712" offset="2861495">And Section 7602(c) prohibits the issuance of a summons by the IRS when such a referral to the U.S. Justice Department is in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.408" offset="2920323">Now, in adding this requirement, we think that the Court of Appeals here erred on two principal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.357" offset="2968075">The first is that the treaty clearly contemplates that the question whether the treaty partner has made a proper request is to be, be determined by the executive branch official designated to administer the treaty, referred to in the treaty as the "competent authority".</text>
            <text syncTime="734.782" offset="3077789">As we have explained in our brief, most of the information that is actually exchanged under these treaties is provided directly by the competent authority without any other entity, judicial or otherwise, of the government being involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.540" offset="3164829">A typical example is compilations of dividend payments by various American corporations to foreign nationals and reciprocal information from the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.143" offset="3227209">In many instances, the rate of withholding is lower for dividend payments to foreign nationals than it would be under the Internal Revenue Law for a dividend payment to an American.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.809" offset="3289903">And the corporations will provide the IRS with a list of the foreign nationals for whom the lower withholding rate provided for by treaty has been utilized, and the IRS without any particular request, even, from our treaty partner will provide compilations of that information to the treaty partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.578" offset="3397005">Much of the information that is exchanged is exchanged without any particular request and without any use of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.950" offset="3434413">Now, in those instances where a summons is used to secure information not already in the hands of the IRS, the summons enforcement proceeding, we submit, which is summary in nature this Court has emphasized many times, should not inject the courts into this aspect of treaty administration in making or second-guessing the determination ordinarily made by the competent authority and by the executive branch about whether the request by the treaty partner is a proper request under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.822" offset="3629913">This is the kind of question that involves sensitive foreign policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.006" offset="3662723">There quite obviously would be sensitivity to having a court inquiry focusing on the good faith of the treaty partner in making a request for information under the treaty in which the courts would be reexamining and perhaps second-guessing the determination made by the executive branch official charged with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.257" offset="3803680">I don't really understand that argument because if you have an, an objective test, whether there's been a reference to prosecution or not, why does that involve any inquiry into good faith?</text>

            <text syncTime="926.316" offset="3843908">Well, it, it, it, it... this Court starting with United States against Powell has characterized the inquiry to be made in the summons enforcement proceedings as an inquiry into the IRS' good faith in issuing the summons, and good faith is largely translated into whether it's for a legitimate statutory purpose, whether the proper procedures have been followed, whether the information may be relevant as the court said to compliance with the Internal Revenue laws, whether there is a collateral purpose, such as harassing the taxpayer or trying to put pressure on the taxpayer to settle a collateral dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.689" offset="4321427">But what this court's line of decisions has indicated is that it is the good faith of the IRS in asking that a summons be enforced that is the proper subject of investigation in a summons enforcement proceeding, not the merits of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.617" offset="4413064">The Powell decision, which is the seminal decision in 379 U.S. made that very clear with respect to two issues that the taxpayer sought to have reexamined that went to the merits of the investigation, two rather discrete issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.609" offset="4493103">One, because the statute of limitations had expired except for fraud, whether there was a sufficient basis to conduct the investigation because there was a sufficient basis to suspect fraud, and the other was whether the Commissioner had properly certified that a, a, a... an additional inspection of records was necessary which had to be certified under the statute when there had already been one inspection of records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.408" offset="4636254">And the Court held that neither of those aspects of the merits of the investigation is something to be raised in the summons enforcement proceeding; that instead, it has to be limited to the kinds of issues that I had averted to a bit earlier and as recently as the Court's unanimous decision in the Tiffany Fine Arts case in Volume 469 U.S., the Court again reemphasized when the taxpayer complained that the IRS was unnecessarily investigating too many licensees under the scheme that was at issue there, and I may quote the Court,</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.011" offset="4850667">"The decision of how many and which licensees to contact is one for the the IRS, not Tiffany to make. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.221" offset="13747556">The Ninth Circuit's approach and the requirement on the IRS to make a prima facie showing of a legitimate purpose including the absence of the prohibited purpose of criminal prosecution I submit is fair, and it's to... in the allocation of the responsibilities and information available to the two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.037" offset="13866778">It's practical because it, it complies with the practice of the parties, the Revenue Service and Revenue Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.310" offset="14415872">The limitation is in subsection (c) about Justice Department referrals being in effect, and the line drawn there is not a line about whether a prosecution is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.336" offset="14468013">It is the question whether Treasury has recommended to Justice that it undertake a grand jury investigation or a prosecution or whether Justice has requested information from Treasury regardless of whether a prosecution is actually pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.891" offset="14542200">And the reason for this limitation on the summons enforcement authority was explained by the Senate report in language set forth on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.433" offset="14592356">It was so as to not to broaden the Justice Department's right of criminal discovery or to infringe on the role of the grand jury.</text>
