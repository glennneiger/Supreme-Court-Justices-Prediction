            <text syncTime="12.769" offset="191816">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.172" offset="205504">The case at bar is similar to and the International submits a logical, at most a logical extension, of Finnegan v. Leu, which has decided by this Court about five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.395" offset="278334">If anything, the case is a stronger case for the union than Finnegan, because in Finnegan, there were 15 appointed business agents that were working, and who were dismissed because they had in the past supported the political opponent of the incumbent president and campaigned for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.965" offset="392645">And in Finnegan, the new president, the newly-elected president, extrapolated from that fact, believing that these people would not be good agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.921" offset="444472">They would not be loyal to him, they would not carry out his policies, and therefore he dismissed them on a wholesale basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.398" offset="474356">In this case, we have--</text>

            <text syncTime="88.950" offset="496613">--In the Finnegan case, it was held that an elected, an appointed agent, such as these business agents, were not denied their rights under sections 101(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the LMRDA, because of this indirect infringement upon their expressive activity, as I read the case, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.638" offset="607372">In this case, we have the same type of confidential policymaking agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.155" offset="641436">In this case, the agent who was removed from his office during the period of the trusteeship, was originally elected to his position, but at the time the activity involved occurred, the union had been placed under a trusteeship by the International Union, and the trusteeship was administering the affairs of the local union, and had plenary authority under the union constitution to remove and replace any officers or employees of the local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.690" offset="799529">Now, this particular business agent, Lynn, not only was likely not to support the rehabilitative policies of the trustee, but he actually did not support them, and in truth, he sabotaged the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.905" offset="888345">And it was only after this series of events took place that the trustee decided that he could not continue to operate and administer the affairs of the local union and try to correct the conditions for which the trusteeship was imposed with Lynn on his staff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.200" offset="11937618">--No, it's not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.421" offset="11942425">But I make this point because we are dealing with a summary judgement in the court below, and the Court below in the Ninth Circuit, emphasized the fact that this was a practice on the part of the defendants to stifle dissent and to stifle debate and the antithesis of democratic operation of the unions, and remanded it back to the District Court to hear evidence on those issues that Mr. Lynn alleged, which is at pages 9 and 10 of the record, the joint appendix, in his complaint, that those were viable, genuine issues of material fact to be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.371" offset="12126223">And that's the reason that I raise it here now... is on that basis that the summary judgement was reversed quite properly by the Ninth Circuit and sent back to the District Court to hear evidence on that point, because Mr. Lynn was in effect not only kicked out of office, he was kicked out of the hiring hall, and has never been dispatched for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.145" offset="12217338">And, I think too, that the results were immediately achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.548" offset="12238967">After Lynn was disciplined, the trustee went back for a fifth vote for a dues increases and finally got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.334" offset="12274076">And I think that's a very important fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.267" offset="12289854">But I think the most important part is what this Court recognized in Finnegan, that unions must be democratically governed and responsive to the will of the membership, and this is exactly why Congress passed the LMRDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.676" offset="12347427">In their preamble, they pointed out that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.268" offset="12365818">Congress found that very often, labor union members were not allowed to choose representatives of their own choosing, and that the labor unions were not paying due regard to the rights of the individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.781" offset="12431855">And the LMRDA was passed to correct that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.193" offset="12445543">And here we have a situation where a majority of the union members elected Lynn on a specific platform, expecting him to speak out on fiscal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.650" offset="12491414">When he did so, a minority in the union... albeit under purported power to disregard Title 1 of the LMRDA... booted him out of office, much to the chagrin of the majority of the members at tending that union meeting and voting and saying no dues increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.702" offset="12567587">This is not a trusteeship issue, for indeed, this is... if it were a trusteeship issue, it would be one of first impression, as far as I can determine, before any federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.479" offset="12614712">It would be coming to the Supreme Court for the first time for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.202" offset="12629550">That's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.424" offset="12634461">We're dealing with a free speech issue under Title 1, where a membership right was directly attacked by getting rid of the duly elected representative who was acting as spokesman for the members in that union that elected him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.855" offset="12704156">They expected him to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.551" offset="12746996">Let me make only the observation that many of the facts that Mr. Stark spoke on are not part of the facts in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.591" offset="12815124">This again is a case that was submitted on cross motions for summary Judgement, and the uncontroverted facts are before the Court in the appendices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.369" offset="12862249">An unverified complaint was filed by Mr. Lynn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.655" offset="12883356">Those facts are not assumed to be true with respect to a motion for summary judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.619" offset="12907284">This was not the granting of a motion to dismiss, this was a case decided on the basis of a motion for summary judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.624" offset="12935287">Now, on the facts of record, to answer the question that some of the Justices asked about, it is clear in the appendix at the joint appendix, at pages 42 and 43, that the general president of the international union, when he imposes a trusteeship, has the power to take such action as he deems necessary to protect the interest and welfare of such local union, and this association and the funds and property and membership thereof, including but not limited to the authority to suspend local union or council officers, business managers or business representatives, fill vacancies in such offices with any representatives of this association or members of such local union, or call elections for that purpose, and impound the books, records, funds and property of any such local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.340" offset="13158164">And the District Judge in the appendix to the petition for the writ of certiorari, at page 33A, found as a uncontroverted fact that the general president delegated to Hawkins as trustee the authority in the constitution under article 3, section 2(c), and he quotes from the constitution,</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.917" offset="13256489">"To take such action as he deems necessary to protect the interests and welfare of local 75, its funds, property and membership, and the interest and welfare of the international association, including but not limited to the right to suspend local union officers, the business manager and/or business representatives to fill vacancies in such positions.
