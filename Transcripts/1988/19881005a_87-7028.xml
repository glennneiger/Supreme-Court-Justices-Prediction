            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument now in Number 87-7028, Mistretta v. the United States, and Number 87-1904, the United States v. Mistretta.</text>
            <text>Mr. Morrison, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented in this case is the Constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, or more precisely, the Constitutionality of the process by which those guidelines were issued.</text>
            <text>To answer the question, it is necessary to know how the guideline system works, and what kind of judgments went into the guidelines.</text>
            <text>In 1984, Congress instituted a new system of determinative sentencing.</text>
            <text>In that determinative sentencing system, it made sentencing guidelines the centerpiece.</text>
            <text>It also recognized that it could not... chose not to issue the guidelines itself.</text>
            <text>Rather, it designated in a statute of commission to do the job.</text>
            <text>The commission to consist of seven members, three of whom were required to be Article 3 Federal Judges, all of whom were appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and no more than four of them could be members of the same political party.</text>
            <text>Now, the term guidelines, which is what the commission is directed to issue, is something of a misnomer.</text>
            <text>These guidelines are not merely advisory.</text>
            <text>They are directions to sentencing judges with which the sentencing judges must comply, unless they find that there is a factor in the particular case which the sentencing commission did not adequately take into account.</text>
            <text>And If the sentencing judge diverts from the guidelines, either above or below the guideline, then the party... either the defendant or the Government... has a right of appeal on the grounds that the sentence was unreasonably either too high or too low.</text>
            <text>Similarly for the first time ever, both defendant and the Government has a right to appeal if they allege that the Court selected an improper guideline or otherwise misapplied the guidelines.</text>
            <text>There is no dispute between the parties that the guidelines constitute the law of sentencing for Federal defendants from November 1, 1987 on, which is the effective date for the guidelines for crimes committed after that date.</text>
            <text>In order to determine whether the guidelines are consistent with separation of powers, it's necessary to examine the kind of judgments that the commission inevitably had to make in establishing a guidelines system.</text>
            <text>The first question that the commission had to confront with respect to each of the crimes... and this is not simply the Title XVIII, but all of the entire Federal criminal code, and other provisions in other parts of the United States Code... where should the sentence be?</text>
            <text>Congress told the commission that the sentencing range for each sentence could be no more than six months or 25 percent maximum to minimum jail time.</text>
            <text>So, for instance, for the crime of stealing a $500 Social Security check in the mail, the commission had to decide what the appropriate punishment was for that particular crime.</text>
            <text>Did it matter the commission had to decide whether the thief was caught before he spent the money, or whether the amount of the check was not $500, but $1,000, and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Morrison, was the commission circumscribed at all by the outside limits of the penalties already prescribed by law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>--Yes, your Honor.</text>
            <text>Yes, your Honor.</text>
            <text>The commission also had to decide whether those similar kinds of monetary adjustments were appropriate for other kinds of crimes against property, for crimes such as tax evasion, for price fixing, securities fraud, and the like.</text>
            <text>Congress told the commission,</text>
            <text>"Start with the average sentences imposed in the past, but that you can move them up or down as you see fit in order to eliminate what Congress said were unwarranted disparities."</text>
            <text>So, the commission had to decide what factors were properly aggravating and what properly mitigating in a particular crime to decide whether the particular differences were warranted or unwarranted.</text>
            <text>That is precisely the kind of process that sentencing judges used to do, before the commission issued its guidelines and they went into effect.</text>
            <text>The second major task that the commission had to undertake was it had to rank the seriousness of disparate kinds of offenses.</text>
            <text>It was not simply enough to decide the absolute offence level for each crime, but as a practical matter, you had to rank the crimes in comparative degree of seriousness.</text>
            <text>So for instance, the commission had to face questions rather like this: how should you punish the sale of six ounces of cocaine, the committing of perjury before Congress, bid rigging in excess of $50 million in Government contracts, the sale of $100 in pornographic materials, or conspiracy to violate the civil rights of a Black family.</text>
            <text>The commission chose, within the statutory range of sentencing, to treat all of those disparate offenses basically the same, and that question of how to treat them was a question that they had to address, despite the very dissimilar facts surrounding each of the crimes.</text>
            <text>It is of course not the function of the Court to decide whether those analogous sentences for different crimes is right or wrong.</text>
            <text>But it's important to note these because it indicates the kind of ranking of judgments that the commission made, these very heavily policy-oriented judgments that are plainly debatable, and that the terms of these debates are about values and about policies, and they are political in the best sense of the word... the kinds of political choices that we normally expect will be made by our political branches.</text>
            <text>This ranking of offenses, is inevitable, any time you have a base level system, which they had to have in this case, between 1 and 43.</text>
            <text>And while the guidelines themselves don't show the ranking, the equal ranking of disparate crimes, we have attached an addendue to our brief, which goes through each base level offense and shows you what the commission determined to be similar crimes and hence deserving of similar punishments.</text>
            <text>There are, in short, no neutral principles that the commission could follow, except its own good sense and personal views about which crimes were more serious or less serious than the others.</text>
            <text>The commission recognized in a number of places that it was making policy decisions, most particularly in the policy decisions to substantially increase the amount of time which persons convicted of white-collar crime, such as tax evasion, public corruption, anti-trust violations, securities fraud, would spend in jail.</text>
            <text>The third set of determinations, that the commission and to make was to decide who gets to go on probation and who doesn't get to go on probation.</text>
            <text>Under the statues, the commission was empowered to lay down the ground rules, and say below a certain level, probation is permissible, but above that level, it is not permissible.</text>
            <text>And the District Judge who sentences the individual is forbidden from giving probation to someone whom the commission said was not entitled to probation for that kind of crime, just as much as the District Judge is forbidden from going above or below the sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text>There is, I believe, a graphic example of the effect that the commission's judgments have on sentencing, and how the commission's judgments reflect its views about what kind of penalties are appropriate for what kind of crime.</text>
            <text>And The example I refer to is that of the recent sentence of Michael Deaver.</text>
            <text>Mr. Deaver was convicted of committing three counts of perjury.</text>
            <text>Assume for simplicity it's only one count, because the guidelines become more confusing when there are multiple counts... another matter which the commission had to deal with.</text>
            <text>Now, under the commission's guidelines, a single count of perjury is a base level 12 offense.</text>
            <text>Because Mr. Deaver had no prior convictions, that would translate into a range of sentence between 10 and 16 months confinement.</text>
            <text>Under the commission's guidelines, alcoholism, which was a factor cited in mitigation, would not have been an excuse to go below the 10 months.</text>
            <text>It would have been a proper basis for the judge to consider, within the 10 to 16 month range.</text>
            <text>Now, of that 10 months, the sentencing commission said five had to be spent in actual confinement... no straight probation, actual confinement.</text>
            <text>And five could have been served in community confinement, which means a person can go out during the day and goes to a halfway house or similar facility in the evening.</text>
            <text>In actuality, the District Judge in this case gave Mr. Deaver three years jail time, but suspended it entirely.</text>
            <text>Under the sentencing guidelines, he could not have done that.</text>
            <text>Now, again, the question is not which set of judgments is right or wrong, the sentencing commission's judgments or the District Court's judgments.</text>
            <text>The point for these purposes is to recognize that the judgment depends about your notions about this relative seriousness of the crime.</text>
            <text>What kind of offenses should people in all cases have to go to jail for?</text>
            <text>And this commission has made those judgments in every one of the cases in which it has written a sentencing guideline for.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You take the position that no commission, regardless of its composition, could have been given that power, I take it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>That is the second argument we make.</text>
            <text>We make the argument on delegation as our second argument, given the definitions and the relatively few limits that Congress has placed upon the commission.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And if we disagree with you on that, then you fall back on the fact that it's the composition of the commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Well, as your Honor notes, those are alternative arguments.</text>
            <text>We have placed the sentencing... let me see, the separation of powers argument first in our brief because we believe it is a lesser argument... that is to say, we don't have to say that necessarily you could never issue sentencing guidelines, but that this commission with this composition, these powers and these restrictions couldn't do it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, would it make a difference if the law did not require that judges serve on the commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>It would make a difference depending upon whether judges were serving on the commission or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what if the President under a law that didn't specify that judges would have to serve... and what if the President in fact asked some to serve, and they said, "All right, we will".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>In my view, that is un-Constitutional as well.</text>
            <text>That is not permissible, to have Article 3 judges serving on commission of this kind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Even as true volunteers, when it isn't mandated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>I think that... yes, that is also correct, your Honor, because of the nature of the kind of choices that the commission was making.</text>
            <text>The thrust of my submission that I have been making here in trying to describe the work of the commission is directly relevant on both the separation of powers issues... because the Court has looked at the functions being performed... as well as the delegation issue, and that factual predicate in this description directly bears on both of them, and not simply on the delegation issue, or on the separation of powers issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what about Owen Roberts on the Pearl Harbor Commission, Earl Warren on the Warren Commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>I believe that all... that many... that those two are factually distinguishable on the grounds that they involved advice-giving and fact-finding.</text>
            <text>But the... both the Government and the sentencing commission cite a number of historic examples about other kinds of activities undertaken by various justices at various times.</text>
            <text>While I think there are some distinctions between that case and this one, principally because this one involves the making of law in a concrete situation... the most important distinction for our purposes is that in none of those examples was the Constitutionality of the conduct ever taken to court, let alone was it reviewed under this Court's jurisprudence on separation of powers as it has evolved since Buckley in 1976.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do you think that practice amounts to nothing in determining Constitutionality?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>I did not say that, your Honor.</text>
            <text>I would not agree that practice amounts to nothing.</text>
            <text>I would point out, however, that there has been practice to the contrary.</text>
            <text>A number of Justices expressed extreme reservations about doing this, and while not directly citing separations of powers situations in all cases... although Justice Stone has done so... I would say that dating from the earliest days of our Republic, when as reported in United States v. Muskrat, President Washington asked Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State to ask the Court for an opinion about the meaning of a treaty.</text>
            <text>Those... the Justices declined to do so on the grounds that it was inappropriate.</text>
            <text>I would suspect that it they had been asked in their individual capacities, as the respondent suggests, as opposed to their official capacity, the outcome should have teen the same.</text>
            <text>So, I think that the history is by no means unified all in one direction, but more importantly, I believe that none of the cases ever involved activities of a concrete, far-reaching nature that affects 40,000 criminal defendants a year, as the activities of the sentencing commission do here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, as long as we're giving you these examples, what about the Federal rules of evidence?</text>
            <text>Suppose that this Court had promulgated the Federal rules of evidence.</text>
            <text>Would that have been Constitutional?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Well, let me divide the answer into two parts, If I may.</text>
            <text>As to the rules not relating to privilege, I would say that there would be no difficulty, that those are very close to the rules of civil procedure.</text>
            <text>That is, of course, the line that Congress ultimately hit upon.</text>
            <text>This Court did, in the early 1970's, pursuant to a Congressional grant, promulgate the rules of evidence, sent them forward to Congress.</text>
            <text>Congress saw them, stopped them from going into effect, and ultimately said,</text>
            <text>"You can't put them into effect as to privileges."</text>
            <text>Now, dealing with the privileges, I would even divide that into two parts.</text>
            <text>It seems to me that it we are dealing with the privileges as applies to Federal law and Federal causes of action involving Federal matters, that the Court may have some limited authority there.</text>
            <text>But what I believe you have, in the case of privileges, are principally questions of value judgments.</text>
            <text>Do we value the confidence between the husband and wife greater than we value the getting at truth?</text>
            <text>How do we value the attorney-client privilege... not so much in the context of litigation, but in terms of pre-litigation matters?</text>
            <text>And it is my view that that is a far closer question... and I think if I had to come down on it, I would say that the Court could not do these... at least certainly many of the privileges.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And is the historical occurrence that Congress old enact the privileges support for your position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Well, I would like to say yes, your honor, but I think that it probably had to do more with a recognition of the underlying nature of the controversies in the privilege area... that is, we are dealing with policy choices that are more substantive in nature than procedural.</text>
            <text>I recognize that in recent years the Court has said... I mean, just last term... that there is no single dividing line between substance and procedure.</text>
            <text>But, on the other hand, the Court has recognized in a number of cases when persons have tried to claim something as procedural to be able to drag it in on the judicial side, the Court has said,</text>
            <text>"No, we won't allow that to take place."</text>
            <text>So, I think that the efforts to expand procedural have... albeit in a different context... have generally not met with favor, and I would think that they would not apply here to the evidence context as well.</text>
            <text>Turning back to the work of the commission, the commission also had to deal with the question of fines within the statutory restrictions.</text>
            <text>The commission was given the discretion to decide under what circumstances fines should be imposed, when and how much.</text>
            <text>Originally the commission thought about having an ability-to-pay fine system, or is the alternative, a system based on a multiplier of the amount of money lost.</text>
            <text>The commission is even now about to hold some hearings dealing with fines for organizations, principally corporate defendants.</text>
            <text>But, in the end, as to individuals, it's set up a schedule under which all but the incident must pay fines in an amount within the range set forth in the schedule.</text>
            <text>So, turning back again to the Michael Deaver example, at the base level offense of 12, Mr. Deaver could have been required to pay a fine of between $3,000 and $30,000.</text>
            <text>In fact, he was fined a $100,000, and again, the answer... the question is, of course, not which set of fines is correct, but it shows how value-laden that part of the system is as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is this argument to say that the commission is treading on judicial, the power of individual judges?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>It is certainly the fact that the commission treads on the power of individual judges.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Well, they make law, but it's not binding.</text>
            <text>I would give the example in this very case, Your Honor... the sentencing guidelines have been before, I think it's approximately 250 Federal judges, who have voted on their Constitutionality.</text>
            <text>I do not have the latest count, I think it is slightly more than 50 percent who have decided they are un-Constitutional, and less than 50 percent Constitutional, for a variety of different reasons.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Many of them include my argument.</text>
            <text>Some of them include delegation arguments, some of them include due process arguments, some of them include arguments I've chosen not to make.</text>
            <text>There are a whole variety, and I would say the same is true on the other side.</text>
            <text>There have been cases upheld on grounds that have not been urged by the parties.</text>
            <text>The point I make, Justice O'Connor, is to indicate that at least in this particular kind of controversy, no one has felt bound by what their fellow judges have done.</text>
            <text>Even in the same district courts, there have been deviations in the same district court, and there have been different defendants being sentenced by different people until this case can be decided.</text>
            <text>Now, the policy choices that this commission had to make were inevitable, given the kind of functions that it would perform, and that the Ninth Circuit was correct in describing these choices as political.</text>
            <text>And Indeed, that is what the Congress expected, because Congress proscribed the presence of more than four members of the commission from being of the same political party.</text>
            <text>That kind of restriction, which is extremely common in executive branch agencies, where we expect our executive branch officials to be making policy, is unique in the judiciary, and it's unique in the judiciary because we do not expect those bodies in the judicial branch to be making policy, making these kind of political choices.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that speaks in favor of the Solicitor-General's argument that in fact this is executive power being exercised.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>I agree, your Honor, and that if the power is properly delegable, it must be executive power.</text>
            <text>Now, the Solicitor-General has a matter which I'm sure he will tend to, of how he's going to move the commission out of the judicial branch, where Congress so carefully placed it, into the executive branch, but in any event... and I'd like to turn to this now, if I may... we don't think it makes any difference.</text>
            <text>That if Congress had placed this body in the executive branch of Government, labeled it 3 judges on it, we don't think that would have made a single bit of difference, and it would have been just as unconstitutional there as it is here.</text>
            <text>And the reason we say that is because we go back to the purposes behind separation of powers for the judicial branch of Government.</text>
            <text>That the Founding Fathers separated the judges because they wanted them to be independent, and they wanted them to be impartial.</text>
            <text>And they were specially concerned about that because they have lifetime appointments.</text>
            <text>Now, it's true that they were also conscious of the possibility of tyranny developing when judges were involved in the making of the law or the executing of the law... but the principal concern was that for the Federal courts to be effective, to be seen as neutral arbiters of our law and our facts, that members of the Federal judiciary have to stay out of the political fray.</text>

            <text>The judicial conference could be said to be making policy, but it principally affects the workings of the Court.</text>
            <text>These sentencing guidelines are intended to affect primary conduct.</text>
            <text>The purpose of the sentencing guidelines, as Congress said, is not to rehabilitate defendants, but to deter them, to punish them.</text>

            <text>Well, let me say, that took place before.</text>
            <text>There were sentencing groups, councils, I don't know the precise appellation... they may have varied from court to court... but they were not mandatory, and that no right of appeal by any defendant or by the Government pertained in the event a judge diverted from that.</text>
            <text>And it seems to me that the mandatory nature makes this into a law-making function that is going on here.</text>
            <text>But as I said, to me it matters not that there is an attempt here to say that judges are after all not sitting as courts of law, they're acting in their individual capacities when they are deciding these rules... that the judges are commissioners and the fact that they are judges is simply... can be disregarded.</text>

            <text>The effort to treat the judges here as acting in their individual capacity falters both on the facts of this statute... that is, that Congress insisted that three Article III judges be on board.</text>
            <text>They insisted that they sit down and meet with four other non-Article III judges, and that they engage in a process that could fairly be called horsetrading, to come up with a ranking of offenses and appropriate levels of offenses involving some of the most political judgments that we have to make.</text>
            <text>And it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether this function was assigned to a court... if it had been assigned to this Court, without the non-judicial members, surely the outcome of the case would not have been any different.</text>
            <text>If your Honors had descended from the bench, taken off your robes, gone into a conference room instead of a courtroom, and decided the case in your individual capacities, decided in your individual capacities to issue these sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text>Surely the outcome can't be depended upon whether you're wearing robes, whether you're called "commissioner" or "your Honor".</text>
            <text>The Constitution deals with the reality that Federal judges who are appointed for life must maintain their neutrality and their impartiality and because this sentencing commission system fundamentally alters that balance, it is un-Constitutional.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_fried">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, for more than 30 years, Congress has been troubled and has worked at the problem of grave, invidious, and inexplicable disparities in the Federal sentencing process.</text>
            <text>In 1958, it tried some gentle measures.</text>
            <text>It put in the judicial councils and institutes to which I believe Justice O'Connor made reference.</text>
            <text>That did no good at all.</text>
            <text>In 1976, they did something a little bit more drastic: we had the Parole Commission Act, which sought to give the parole commission power to even out the sometimes quite dreadful disparities after the fact, and the Court will be familiar with that from the Adinizio case.</text>
            <text>That, too, failed, and it failed because the judges and the parole commission were working at cross purposes, and the sentencing judges would anticipate the work of the parole commission in pronouncing sentence.</text>
            <text>So, strong measures were required to obtain equality and honesty in sentencing.</text>
            <text>Now, I think that this statute is misunderstood when it is viewed as being unduly rigid.</text>
            <text>It provides for 25 percent range in which the sentencing judge may operate.</text>
            <text>That should be enough... and allows for departures in a rather wide range of circumstances, provided that the judge gives reasons and explains what he's doing.</text>
            <text>Now, Petitioner raises three objections.</text>
            <text>He objects that Congress did not do the whole job here, but rather delegated it to an expert independent agency, and then Petitioner complains as to how that agency is constituted, and most particularly about the inclusion of three Federal judges among the seven members.</text>
            <text>Turning to the delegation point... because it's a good way to indicate what the commission actually did do... one would have thought, given the very great particularity in the statute, that it would be too late in the day to raise a delegation objection.</text>
            <text>In fact, the statute sets not only the goals for the commission, but provides the methodology and makes many of the particular judgments, and as was remarked from the bench, of course, all of this takes place within the maxima which are set out by the particular criminal statues, and which are the basis for the kind of grading of severity to which Mr. Morrison referred.</text>
            <text>Turning to the methodology because it's most important; the statue required the commission to begin with actual experience.</text>
            <text>And, indeed, the commission surveyed 40,000 cases, 10,000 of them in very great detail, to see what the sentences actually served under actual circumstances involving the circumstances of the case, the circumstances of the offender... what they were.</text>
            <text>And not only did the commission start with actual experience, to a large extent that's where it ended.</text>
            <text>To a large extent, these guidelines reflect today's practice.</text>
            <text>Where the commission departed in these value judgments about which you've heard, they have done so under the explicit mandate of the Act, that for instance, violent offenders, repeat offenders, career criminals, drug traffickers, be sentenced at or near the maximum.</text>
            <text>That is not something the commission dreamed up... they were enjoined to do that by the statute.</text>
            <text>Similarly, as to white collar criminals--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But the problem is, they've been enjoined to do it for every case.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_fried">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text>--What I was suggesting, Justice White, is that the commission was enjoined to do it by the statute, and therefore they were not simply following their own policy judgement.</text>
            <text>That they were being guided by what Congress had required, and the guidance from Congress here, I submit, was miles greater than we usually encounter in a delegation.</text>

            <text>And the suggestion that this is something that Congress might have handed to an advisory panel, then to enact its work, misses the point that these guidelines, in order to be sensible and effective, must be evolutionary.</text>
            <text>They must require monitoring of what happens and constant revision, and that of course is precisely the kind of work which is given to an independent agency.</text>

            <text>Now, beyond the delegation, beyond the delegation objection, which obviously is more formidable than I had imagined it to be--</text>
            <text>[Laughter]</text>
            <text>The complaint is made that the phrase, that this is an independent commission in the judicial branch is a cause for concern.</text>
            <text>Should we stumble over the phrase "in the judicial branch"?</text>
            <text>A number of things are quite clear: that the commission is not a court, and that is not simply a technical point.</text>
            <text>It is not a court because it does not issue judgments in cases, it is not subject to appellate jurisdiction, its judgments cannot be appealed from, it is not issuing final judgments.</text>
            <text>And it is not subordinate to any court as are, for instance probation officers or bankruptcy judges.</text>
            <text>It is in the judicial branch in a perfectly harmless, Constitutionally harmless sense, and that is, first of all, that it is... its judicial branch connections, which explain the logistics of managing this commission... who makes out the checks, how is the budget submitted, that particular housekeeping rules, such as the Freedom of Information Act, conflict of interest laws, and xx on, will apply?</text>
            <text>Similarly, there is a strong administrative connection between the commission and the administrative office of the courts, and the probation offices, which supply it with a great deal of its information.</text>
            <text>And that seems to me a set at consequences which Congress might have provided in detail, but in fact, it did so compendiously by stating that this is an independent commission in the judicial branch.</text>
            <text>Furthermore, of courses, and much more substantively, this is a way of underlining Congress' very great concern that this be an independent commission... and that, of course, is also thereby accomplished.</text>
            <text>But beyond that, I see no reason, I see no need, to engage in a rewriting or severance, or anything else, of what Congress did, because I am unable to discover any harmful, any infectious aspect to that designation.</text>
            <text>What the designation does do is perfectly appropriate, and if there is some work that it does do that I have not been able to discover, that is inappropriate, by all means let us sever that, but I don't know what it is.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court, the problem that Congress faced when it enacted this statute is well known to this Court.</text>
            <text>I'll try to adjust my machinery here... there's too much machinery.</text>
            <text>The problem is familiar to this Court from cases like Furman and Georgia and other cases which showed ugly and indefensible discriminations and disparities and irrational distinctions in the punishments that people get in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text>And in those cases, litigants came to this Court and said</text>
            <text>"This Court should do something about that."</text>
            <text>Now, this case is very different because in this case, the executive departments and the Congress for 10 years put on a massive bipartisan effort, and it said,</text>
            <text>"we're going to do something about it."</text>
            <text>"We're going to reduce these ugly and indefensible discriminations and disparities in criminal sentences."</text>
            <text>And now this Court is being asked to undo this effort and really send us back to what were very ugly days of discriminatory and arbitrary sentencing.</text>
            <text>Now, I think really the key to Mr. Morrison's submission here today is simply that this... Congress has never quite created an animal quite like this.</text>
            <text>The sentencing commission is not quite like the parole board... its guidelines are not quite like the rules of procedure, and therefore this is un-Constitutional.</text>
            <text>But there is no rule of Constitutional law that Congress may not do something that is new.</text>
            <text>In this courtroom, this Petitioner must really show that this act violated the separation of powers by really prejudicing one of the branches from doing their Constitutionally-appropriate law.</text>
            <text>We really must find actual prejudice under the standards of separation of powers that this Court has promulgated.</text>
            <text>Mere atmospherics is not enough, and our central submission, your Honors, is that there is no incursion here on any Constitutional role of the executive, and that this commission and this Act does not prejudice the independence and the impartiality and the performance by the courts of doing their Constitutionally-assigned functions.</text>
            <text>Now, this Act is an act that, creates an institutional design.</text>
            <text>What are the parts of the design?</text>
            <text>Congress says this ought to be an independent commission, and as far as I understand, there was no serious argument that that was un-Constitutional.</text>
            <text>Congress said this commission should not be controlled by the political branches or by the Congress or even controlled by the courts, because this agency is not under the comination of the courts.</text>
            <text>Second Congress said this agency is to be designated as being in the judicial branch... and there's been talk about what does that mean?</text>
            <text>Congress had, I think, very simple purposes in mind in making that designation.</text>
            <text>It had practical purposes.</text>
            <text>The commission in its daily work works intimately, all the time, with the judicial apparatus, and it just makes logistical and administrative and budgetary sense to put it in the Judicial branch.</text>
            <text>Congress had a symbolic functions here in this designation.</text>
            <text>As the Senate commission said, Congress wanted sentencing to continue to be primarily a judicial function.</text>
            <text>For 150 years, it was the judges' responsibility to sentence.</text>
            <text>And that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>As courts, it was the court's responsibility to sentence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text>--But the general, the symbolism of making the judicial branch responsible for bringing order and good repair into the judicial house of sentencing... Congress thought that it was important to make the Judicial branch responsible for that role.</text>
            <text>Congress also had in mind your Honor... it's a precautionary note, and that's the point of independence.</text>
            <text>Congress wanted to make sure that sentencing kept free from the domination of the executive branch, which initiates prosecutions.</text>
            <text>It wanted to make sure the commissions is independent.</text>
            <text>Now, Mr. Morrison's central submission... I think Justice Scalla's questions probe at this issue... is that the problem this statute creates is with respect to the judicial branch, because the judicial has never before been given the task of issuing legislative style rules that so directly affect the liberties of citizens.</text>
            <text>They have been given this task that looks like the making of law... and Mr. Morrison says that's incongruous, and therefore un-Constitutional.</text>
            <text>But it seems to me, your Honor, that there are clearly important factors which show that this is a separate situation, and a distinct situation, which makes this a congruous assignment by Congress.</text>
            <text>Congress had, really, four factors, I think, in mind.</text>
            <text>First of all, this job was not given, Justice Kennedy, to the courts or to the judges.</text>
            <text>It was given to an agency that functionally functions exactly like a hundred other independent agencies.</text>
            <text>It happens to have three Judges.</text>
            <text>But this is not the same case as if Congress had said,</text>
            <text>"This Court is to issue sentencing guidelines."</text>
            <text>The Court does not need to decide today whether that would be Constitutional, although in candor I should tell the Court that our position is that sentencing is so special that sentencing is so closely tied to the fair administration of justice in the courts, that if Congress finds that this Court should be made responsible for helping to bring some order into the task of sentencing, that would be valid.</text>
            <text>But that's not this Court's problem today.</text>
            <text>The second point about these rules is historical.</text>
            <text>This delegation is novel in form but not in substance.</text>
            <text>It is for 150 years the courts have already, in their sentencing decisions, exercised virtually unfettered lawmaking power.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, they may have decided they wanted to fetter it.</text>
            <text>Congress wanted to fetter the power that individual judges had been exercising, because they are the ones who created the problem.</text>
            <text>They are the ones who gave the disparate sentences all around the country.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text>I think I agree with that completely, your honor.</text>
            <text>In a sense, we had the worst of both worlds, because Congress had created no general standards, so the courts in their individual decisions were making general, implicit, general standards.</text>
            <text>The only difference is that they were doing it one by one.</text>
            <text>That is, there is a sense in which the courts, the individual judges, were making sentencing guidelines for 150 years, because Congress provided no standards.</text>
            <text>And the only difference is that they did it each one for himself, each one for herself.</text>

            <text>I don't call that making a law.</text>
            <text>I call making a law, all defendants that have this characteristic will get 15 years.</text>
            <text>That's a law.</text>
            <text>But saying that this defendant will get 15 years... that's not a law at all.</text>

            <text>Your Honor, I believe substantively they were making the law in deciding what ought to be the severity of punishment.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I think we're using law in two different senses.</text>
            <text>You're not using it in the relevant sense here, it seems to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text>They were doing it case by case... of course I acknowledge that.</text>
            <text>But the distinction between case by case adjudication and general rulemaking is at its weakest where the Congress provides no general standards, and the courts have to... even it implicitly... create the standards as well as to make the particular application point.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, suppose that Congress told the courts, that Congress created a commission with judges on it, judges only, to promulgate rules for damages in libel cases.</text>
            <text>Now, really, Professor, the whole justification for our making law at all... and we do all the time... is because we must do so in order to decide a case.</text>
            <text>And that's not what the sentencing guidelines are.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text>Your Honor, our position would be that if Congress created an independent agency and said judges ought to be participating in it, and the purpose of the agency is to rationalize and clean up a system of incredible discrepancies in, for instance, the allocation of punitive damages... we think that ought to be Constitutional.</text>
            <text>Now, sentencing seems to me an even easier case though, because of the very special role that judges nave historically played in the creation of law and policy with respect to sentences.</text>
            <text>But that is within the general ambit of our argument, your Honor, and would a distinguish both of those cases from what we were talking about... the anti-trust guidelines.</text>
            <text>There is a jurisprudential difference between sentencing guidelines and anti-trust guidelines.</text>
            <text>Sentencing guidelines do not tell the citizens, "This is now illegal".</text>
            <text>No sentencing guideline makes illegal or actionable anything that had been done before.</text>
            <text>Of course it has an impact on liberties, but it is not jurisprudentially a substantive rule, and that's an important distinction.</text>
            <text>I have one more point, your Honors, and that's a separation of powers point.</text>
            <text>And it's also a very important practical point.</text>
            <text>Overall, globally viewed, the Sentencing Reform Act significantly reduces, rather than expands, the overall power of the judicial branch to make law with respect to sentencing.</text>
            <text>Before the Act, the judicial branch exercised a plenary discretion to make sentencing law.</text>
            <text>This Act significantly narrows and makes accountable that power.</text>
            <text>The doctrine of separation of powers is supposed to have something to do with liberty, and it would be a huge irony if this Court invalidated a statute whose global effect is not to increase but sharply to curtail the prerogatives of one of the branches of Government.</text>
            <text>Your Honor, I have not had time to deal with a question of the specific service at judges, and I will leave that issue to the briefs, and also to the arguments made by the Solicitor-General.</text>
            <text>I want to add one footnote, if I have time.</text>
            <text>In his reply brief, Mr. Morrison makes, I think, an important concession.</text>
            <text>He says it would be Constitutional to have a commission in the judicial branch with judges dealing with issues of parole and reduction of good time.</text>
            <text>I think that's a fatal concession for him, both at a superficial and at a deep level; at a superficial level, because I don't understand the distinction, at a Constitutional level, between the commission that deals with parole and the commission that deals with the things this commission did.</text>
            <text>At a deeper level, I think, the concession shows that sentencing cannot be cabined into the tidy table of organization that Petitioner prefers.</text>
            <text>Sentencing has always been a special feature of our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text>It's always been a field in which responsibility has been shared among the branches.</text>

            <text>Exactly that same constraint operated on the commission.</text>
            <text>The maximums created by statute continue to bind the commission, and the commission and the judge then operating with the guidelines together are exercising not more authority but less authority than before the sentencing guidelines, because Congress added an awful lot of other, specific, narrowing to the situation.</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Alan B. Morrison</heading>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text>Thank you, your Honor.</text>
            <text>Let me turn first to the point that Mr. Bator made regarding the question of whether these kinds of Parole and probation functions could be taken care if in the judicial branch, although they're now in the executive branch.</text>
            <text>I thought that our reply brief was clear, but if it's not, I'll make it clear now.</text>
            <text>We weren't talking about what judges could do, but I don't think it would matter.</text>
            <text>I think the important points is that in those particular circumstances, they would be acting as individual adjudicators, much as the parole commission now adjudicates when a person, or determines when a person is entitled to parole.</text>
            <text>We said nothing about judges laying down rules to apply to probation any more than judges now do.</text>
            <text>Second, I want to be clear that although Bator says that you have to show actual prejudice to find a violation of separation of powers, last year in this Court's decision in Morrison v. Olson, when discussion the question of whether the independent counsel, the judges could close down the office of the independent counsel in the event the work of the independent counsel was done, the Court did not look to find actual prejudice.</text>
            <text>It said that</text>
            <text>"we will construe the statute narrowly, lest it be considered that the special court could engage in administrative-type activity."</text>
            <text>No showing of actual prejudice to any branch of the Government... a prophylactic rule of the kind that we're asking for here.</text>
            <text>It is, I suggest, the fact that if this Commission is allowed to do this that we will have commissions on punitive damages dealing with remedies, on pain and suffering dealing with remedies, on statues of limitations dealing with remedies, at least in Federal causes.</text>
            <text>Indeed, we could have the commission re-write the bankruptcy code, for what is the bankruptcy law after all but a series of remedies for pre-existing rights?</text>
            <text>And if you do not believe, as I do, that that's sufficiently incongruous for Article III judges to be performing on their own, it certainly seems to me that given our separation of powers to add four non-judges to a commission and to have them make the policy choices offends our basic notions of separation of powers, and for those reasons, the commission cannot stand.</text>
            <text>Let me say one final word about the Solicitor-General's notion of need for evolution.</text>
            <text>If the Congress had taken the advice of many and passed this statute, these guidelines into law, we would have a very different set of circumstances, for the basic policy choices would have been made, albeit with much advice, by the Congress when it enacted it into the law.</text>
            <text>We would then have intelligible principles against which we could determine whether, in the light of experience, the guidelines were working.</text>
            <text>We would have a very different situation, so it would be a one-shot act by Congress, followed by a commission which thereafter properly constituted could effectively carry out the law and not leave in place forever.</text>
            <text>Thank you very much.</text>
