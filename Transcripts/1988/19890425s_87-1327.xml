            <text syncTime="8.857" offset="121983">Seven years ago in Mary Anne against the Hickorel Apache Tribe, we held that the tribe has the power to impose a severance tax on the production of oil and gas by Non-Indian lessees of oils located on the tribe's reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.503" offset="184572">Today, in an appeal form the New Mexico Court of Appeals, we hold that the State of New Mexico may also impose a severance tax on the same production of oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.439" offset="224279">In an opinion filed with the clerk of the court, we conclude that the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, which grants the tribe authority to execute mineral leases does not include an express or implied prohibition on state taxation of the Non-Indian lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.073" offset="290839">Nor are we able to find such a prohibition in any other congressional enactment or in the now repudiated doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.004" offset="326574">We also reject Cotton's contention that the state severance tax is inconsistent with the commerce clause because the aggregation of state and Indian taxes imposes a higher burden of on-reservation production than on other production in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.102" offset="382894">Most significantly, there is simply no basis for concluding that Indian tribes which are separately mentioned in the commerce clause should be treated as states engaged in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.203" offset="423332">The judgment of the New Mexico Court of Appeals is therefore, affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.898" offset="438065">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall have joined.</text>
