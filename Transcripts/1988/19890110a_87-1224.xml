            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138555">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1224, Mark Oring versus The State Bar of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.342" offset="171887">Mr. Cohen, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="49.496" offset="336459">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.198" offset="347326">Mark Oring, a lawyer, was disciplined by the State Bar of California for presenting a testimonial radio communication which was never found to be false, misleading, or deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.412" offset="400197">In fact, the State Bar of California stipulated that the advertisement was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.301" offset="423708">The basis for the discipline was a presumption that testimonial advertisement is presumed to be false, misleading, or deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.531" offset="460593">Under this Court's prior decisions, such a presumption placing the burden on the speaker to prove the protected nature of the speech, thus effectively banning any testimonial advertisement, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.336" offset="527884">The constitutional ground rules governing this area we believe to be crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.537" offset="552648">Again last term in Shapero versus Kentucky Bar, this Court reiterated the well-established standard that state rules designed to prevent the potential for deception and confusion may be no broader than reasonably necessary to prevent the perceived evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.326" offset="619835">We feel that the State Bar itself has recognized that its legitimate goal of preventing deceptive advertising can in fact be met by a less stringent and restrictive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.181" offset="667273">To bring the case up to date, in November, or on November 28th of 1988, the California Supreme Court adopted the State Bar's proposed rule, which we have set forth in our briefs and in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.739" offset="725474">So the California Supreme Court has now formally adopted the State Bar's proposed rule which removes that presumption so long as the advertisement or testimonial advertisement contains a disclaimer which states that it is not a guarantee or prediction regarding the outcome of the potential client's case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="199.751" offset="937484">I don't say at this point that I think even requiring a disclaimer would be constitutional because I don't know that testimonial advertisements should be treated any differently than advertisements in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.527" offset="996625">Apparently the Federal Trade Commission doesn't feel that they have to be treated any differently, and they feel sufficiently secure that they can test each ad on its own merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.483" offset="1124416">I mean, it's surely true that if you had somebody saying, this was one pleased client, of course this doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be pleased or that all clients are always pleased, that ads to the truth of it, doesn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="257.964" offset="1170392">I should think your argument is that you have no right to require somebody to add to the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.680" offset="1185229">Isn't that your basic argument, that you can't require somebody to put in something he doesn't want to say?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.046" offset="1274673">I think very clearly... and we've set these forth in both our opening and reply briefs... the agreement initially made with the State Bar was for an admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.166" offset="1335172">That is what we stipulated to, an admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.243" offset="1347502">What the State Bar imposed upon Mr. Oring was a public reproval.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.502" offset="1396508">And I think that was really a word of art that we used during the State Bar hearings to indicate a lid on what should happen to Mr. Oring.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.420" offset="1432139">The intention of everyone... and I would like to quote if I may from the actual reporter's transcript here, where I think Mr. Markle, who represented the State Bar, himself clearly understood that, in the event that the entire stipulation were not accepted, that it would be of no force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.946" offset="1502251">But I think that we placed a cap on the discipline so that Mr. Oring's and Mr. Grey's case could be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.068" offset="1530777">And since they had been partners and since it was just a single advertisement that had been run by both of them, we didn't want one body or one group of referees to perhaps impose one form of discipline on Mr. Grey and then a different form of discipline on Mr. Oring.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.796" offset="1593680">So I think it was everyone's intent that both should receive the same discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.623" offset="1609040">However, the discipline that was stipulated to was an admonition, and our opening brief is wrong insofar as it sets forth that we stipulated to a public reproval, because we did not stipulate to a public reproval.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.220" offset="1735368">As a matter of fact, the State Bar in its letter of reprimand to Mr. Oring not only enclosed a copy of the rules governing appeals to the Supreme Court, but specifically stated that this may be appealed to the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.218" offset="6571365">And he later goes on to say that he understands there is a possibility that the discipline might be increased, because he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.951" offset="6602294">"For example, supposing, which this doesn't apply, but supposing there were a situation where it was a stipulated suspension of 30 days. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.014" offset="6738548">In other words, Mr. Grey was going to be the designated litigator, Mr. Oring would take a back seat, and when discipline was officially and finally imposed against Mr. Grey, if any, it would be imposed against Mr. Oring.</text>
