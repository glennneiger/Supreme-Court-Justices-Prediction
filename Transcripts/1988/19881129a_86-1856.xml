            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146261">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1856, Northwest Central Pipeline Corporation v. The State Corporation Commission of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.890" offset="197774">Now, Mr. Talisman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_l_talisman" startTime="15.901" stopTime="342.445">
            <label>Mr. Harold L. Talisman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.901" offset="209791">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.655" offset="240824">This is another case involving a regulation of the Kansas Corporation Commission which is designed to alter the purchasing practices of interstate natural gas pipelines that are regulated under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.238" offset="315117">I say it's another case because on two prior occasions, in 1958 in Cities Service Gas Company versus The Kansas Corporation Commission and in 1963 in Northern Natural Gas Company versus The Kansas Corporation Commission, this Court held invalid Kansas Corporation Commission regulations which intruded on federal regulation under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.075" offset="414486">There as here the Kansas Corporation Commission contended that those regulations were necessary for it to carry out its functions in the regulation of production from Kansas fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.445" offset="467985">In Northern Natural Gas Company, this Court squarely held that the Kansas Corporation Commission could not either directly or indirectly intrude on federal regulation of purchasing practices of interstate pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.823" offset="529530">And it therefore held that a Kansas regulation which had directed a pipeline company to take gas in a certain manner in that field to be invalid under the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.032" offset="574356">More recently, in 1986 in Transcontinental, this Court upheld and it reaffirmed the Northern Natural decision although the gas in that case was federally deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.250" offset="627228">Since the gas in this case is old gas, gas that remains subject to federal regulation, it's our view that this case falls squarely within the confines of the Northern Natural decision and a fortiori, Transcontinental.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.332" offset="691489">Now, the Kansas Commission contends they have... that they have circumvented this Court's prohibitions in Northern Natural and in the Transco case because the regulation in this case is nominally addressed to producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.501" offset="756168">But the record shows clearly that the purpose and effect of the regulation is to alter the purchasing practices of interstate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.367" offset="799636">Indeed, it was justified on the basis that it would cause interstate pipelines to buy more Kansas gas at the expense of gas from other sources outside of Kansas on pain of suffering an economic penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.598" offset="856583">It's for this reason that we contend that the regulation in this case is the same type of case that we had in Northern Natural, but it's in sheep's clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.275" offset="903290">With that brief introduction, let me outline the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.787" offset="913321">The regulation that we're talking about in this case applies to the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.353" offset="935577">It is one of the largest, if not the largest, gas field and one of the old gas fields in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.017" offset="958251">Northwest Central is one of several interstate pipeline companies that purchased gas from the Kansas Hugoton Field under long-term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.632" offset="992733">The natural gas pipeline companies that purchase gas in this field have invested hundreds of millions of collars in pipeline facilities to take gas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.467" offset="1028050">And those facilities were authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission upon a showing that there would be sufficient reserves to support the investments that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.244" offset="1071205">The gas which Northwest Central and other pipelines take in this field is commingled with gas which they take from other sources in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.749" offset="1101193">This gas is transported and sold in interstate commerce to retail... to distributors that resell the gas for ultimate consumption for residential, commercial and industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.129" offset="1158767">The rates that are charged by Northwest Central and other pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act on a cost-of-service basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.083" offset="1198578">And the cost to purchase gas is probably the... no doubt the largest item in the cost of service, and the mix of gas affects that cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.033" offset="1242359">And, therefore, the cost to purchase gas is subject to very, very close scrutiny by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission including prudency reviews as to the mix of gas being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.349" offset="1291574">Now, the Kansas Commission has authority to regulate production in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.994" offset="1318219">Under Kansas law, the objective is for the regulation to provide that each owner in a common pool will get its fair share of the gas in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.571" offset="1364508">So, the purpose of the law is not to promote Kansas gas, but rather to provide a basis upon... in which each producer will get his share of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.418" offset="1395854">In doing that, Kansas establishes allowables for each well on a monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.742" offset="1425216">The allowables are basically a limit on how much well... how much each well can produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.414" offset="1439845">And because wells in the Kansas Hugoton Field do not produce uniformly because the purchaser's requirements are for different or for other reasons, wells can either over-produce or under-produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.760" offset="1485298">And where there is an accumulated underage, the underage is cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.414" offset="1507868">But it is--</text>

            <text syncTime="368.234" offset="1619149">why can't Kansas say the fair rule is if you're all tapped into the same pool of gas, whoever takes it out gets it?</text>

            <text syncTime="402.156" offset="1754881">Well, they've changed their mind, and they're going closer back to a rule of capture.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.328" offset="1767525">Would the rule of capture violate in and of itself the Natural Gas Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="427.703" offset="1857072">There would be no limits on what they could produce in order to catch up.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.393" offset="1871805">But Kansas hasn't repealed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.027" offset="1882359">What Kansas is doing is continuing the process of having allowables, but what it's saying is that the reinstatement provision, the provision that has existed previously in the law, that permits a producer who was underproduced an opportunity to get the allowables that were cancelled reinstated so it could catch up and get Its fair share of the gas, that that no longer will exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.291" offset="1979325">And the purpose of that, the clear purpose as shown by the... by the record in this case... the clear purpose of their doing that was basically to confront the interstate pipeline companies with a Hobson's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.921" offset="2029899">Either they had to start taking more gas out of the Kansas Hugoton Field under the timetable that Kansas wanted us to take it out of the field, or else they would forego their contractual opportunities to take that gas at a... at a... at a later time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.020" offset="5222271">I don't say that it must take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.590" offset="5228540">I... I say that it cannot issue a regulation which is intended to change the mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.045" offset="5250379">Let me show you the conflict here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.666" offset="5256857">While this... after our notice of appeal was filed in this case, in fact, after our initial brief was filed, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a order concluding a long proceeding relating to the purchase mix of Northwest Central Pipeline Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.866" offset="5333657">The Kansas Corporation Commission was an intervenor in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.968" offset="5346091">And a number of parties presented their views as to what the purchase mix of the company should be, including some parties saying that they thought that we should be taking greater amounts of gas from the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.398" offset="5403770">And... and the Commission heard these various claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.422" offset="5419861">There was a pretty extensive hearing, administrative law judge's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.424" offset="5439923">And the Commission concluded that it rejected the proposals of parties that more gas should be taken from the Kansas Hugoton Field and it approved as prudent the purchasing mix being used by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.192" offset="5479002">And the... the mix being used by the company was to take a mix of low-priced and high-priced gas and to blend it together and to try to arrive at a target market price which would enable it to compete against alternative fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.590" offset="5536576">And by not taking all of the Kansas Hugoton gas, which was lower priced, and reserving that for mixing with some of the higher priced gas for future use, the company was-able to be able to reserve some to be competitive in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.943" offset="5601987">And it was able also to avoid incurring payments for gas not taken in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.145" offset="5622780">Now, the record in that case showed that had we taken the volumes of gas from the Kansas Hugoton Field that the parties wanted us to take, we would have incurred some $77 million of take-or-pay payments in just a period of eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.594" offset="5676592">And the Commission found this... found what we were doing to be prudent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.041" offset="6318369">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.919" offset="6357866">The purpose of my argument is to show that the Kansas Corporation Commission's order amending paragraph P of the basic proration order for the Kansas Hugoton Field was an exercise of the state's legitimate interest to conserve its natural resources by preventing waste from occurring in the field and in protecting correlative rights of adjoining leaseholders in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.844" offset="6453579">Second, the action of the Kansas Commission... the action the Kansas Commission took fits squarely within the production and gathering exemption of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.942" offset="6494016">And finally, the effect of the Kansas Commission's order does not interfere with the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme, nor does it unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.969" offset="6546052">The problem in the field, in the Kansas Hugoton Field, was that the field was out of balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.966" offset="6578026">Pressures in the Kansas Hugoton Field indicated that gas was draining from a non-producing well to the producing well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.550" offset="6616374">The reason for that is that when a well is not producing or is shut in, pressures accumulate in that well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.708" offset="6649079">Gas migrates in the field... in a common source of supply in this field, in the Kansas Hugoton Field, from a high pressure zone to a low pressure zone, the low pressure zone being the area in which the well is timely producing its allowables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.485" offset="6708116">That's what was happening here in the Kansas... in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.108" offset="6722640">The field was being used as a storage facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.821" offset="6737477">Some producers were not timely producing their production allowable, and by not timely producing that production allowable, it was causing the drainage of that gas from the high pressure area, from the shut-in well area, to the low pressure area which was violating correlative rights and causing waste to occur in the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.084" offset="9554522">That allowable takes into consideration the fact that they may not have been producing because of the allowable... because the allowable formula is made up of three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.182" offset="9594960">It's made up of acreage, which is the spacing unit, which in the Hugoton Field is 640 acres equals one unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.233" offset="9647100">And if you recall, well pressure is going to be higher if your well has not been producing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.240" offset="9679179">Therefore, you're going to get a higher allowable assignment in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.009" offset="9690254">And the third factor is market demand which is set by the Commission based on the nominations of the producers and purchasers of what they... what they anticipate to use in the... in the upcoming six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.608" offset="9736648">So, they're not being... they're not being they're not... they are... they do have a chance to produce that... that... those reserves in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.563" offset="9776459">what we're doing is... is merely asking them to... we're encouraging the producer to timely produce those reserves in the field to prevent the waste that the Commission found in its expertise was occurring in the field, to balance off the field, to balance off the pressures in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.276" offset="9843332">This case is distinguishable from Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.151" offset="9862767">The reason this case is distinguishable from Northern is because in Northern, the Northern decision or the action the Commission took or the orders taken in Northern were directed at purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.221" offset="9923058">It ordered the pipelines to take gas rateably in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.695" offset="9948971">In our decision the Commission is not ordering the pipelines to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.598" offset="9964645">The pipeline doesn't have to... doesn't have to buy more Kansas gas if the pipeline doesn't want to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.740" offset="10037161">And if it does, does it lose its rights to the reserves in the field?</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.184" offset="10054924">Clearly not because a new allowable, even if their... even if their underages are cancelled, a new allowable is assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.668" offset="10084912">The Commission's order is reasonable in light of Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.852" offset="10101631">The effect of the order is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.215" offset="10111035">It's not going... you know, the effect of this order is incidental on the pipeline's purchasing practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.589" offset="10140605">It becomes merely a consideration to have to take, merely a consideration that the pipeline has to make when it's purchasing gas, just like it makes a consideration on whether to buy gas from Wyoming, Oklahoma, Texas or any other state, just like it makes a decision to buy more take-or-pay gas or less take-or-pay gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.994" offset="10226183">It becomes merely a consideration and the effect is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.577" offset="10240498">The effect of this decision could impact... as the amicus brief filed by the Council on State and Local Government indicates, 17 states across the country have similar law, have laws similar to Kansas that regulate the proration in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.568" offset="10308521">Proration in the field means that gas... that each well is producing its fair share in proportion to other wells' production in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.075" offset="10346555">So, the impact of this decision means a lot to about 17 states that produce natural gas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.209" offset="10371005">Every state has some form of proration, some form of an assignment of an allowable to the field to assure that that state conserves its natural resources by the orderly production of natural gas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.861" offset="10433699">Therefore, I ask this Court to affirm the Kansas Supreme Court's decision upholding the Kansas Commission order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.402" offset="10687819">The preemption question calls for two separate inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.235" offset="10703179">First, is the state regulating in an area where federal law occupies the field and therefore leaves no room for state action?</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.692" offset="10732958">And the second preemption question is whether the state rule conflicts with federal law, in other words, whether it interferes with the federal regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.857" offset="10765663">The Natural Gas Act itself essentially answers the first preemption inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.516" offset="11116227">It's controlling production, and therefore that's why the first preemption question is relatively easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.482" offset="11144125">The second preemption question, whether the Kansas order conflicts with the federal regulatory scheme, is somewhat more difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.087" offset="11186548">First of all, the Kansas rule tells producers that in a certain situation you might not be able to bark your production credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.514" offset="11224269">It doesn't tell the pipeline that it has to buy anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.547" offset="11244436">If the pipeline is risk-averse and worried that this gas might not be there ten years down the road, it can choose to buy the gas now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.994" offset="11282157">But it's not forcing them to buy the gas, and that's a critical distinction between this case and the cases in Northern Natural and Transco and that is because the Kansas rule by itself isn't going to change anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.082" offset="11330535">The pipeline... first of all, the producer is going to have to decide whether to produce more gas and we recognize that the producer... that that decision whether to produce more gas is obviously tied to a pipeline's decision whether to purchase more gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.119" offset="11386646">But the pipeline's decision is going to be based on Kansas' rules, other states' rules, available sources of other natural gas, its take-or-pay liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.337" offset="13327544">Now, we submit that the modest kinds of criminal penalties that were involved in the Northern Natural case are far less significant than the sanctions of losing the supply.</text>
