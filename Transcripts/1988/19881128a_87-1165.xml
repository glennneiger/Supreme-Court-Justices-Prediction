            <text syncTime="15.310" offset="212091">This case is the latest chapter in the ten-year effort of the states of California and Arizona and several of their public agencies to obtain a judicial determination of the disputed boundaries of the Fort Mojave, Colorado River, and Fort Yuma Indian Reservations on the lower Colorado River in order to remove a cloud on the title to 104,000 acre-feet of water, which is presently being used by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, to serve the needs of over 500,000 citizens in its service area.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.261" offset="339882">The water rights of the three reservations were originally adjudicated by this Court in 1963 in Arizona against California I.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.548" offset="373005">The United States subsequently sought additional water for the three reservations, and in 1983 in this Court's decision in Arizona against California II the Court rejected the United States' claims for the additional 104,000 acre-feet of water because it was based on claims stemming from the Secretary of the Interior's subsequent ex parte reinterpretation and expansion of the boundaries of the three reservations without affording the state parties notice or an opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.068" offset="507066">And none of those decisions ever received any judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.932" offset="522530">The state parties had urged in 1983 that this Court decide the boundary disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.098" offset="551160">But the Court directed us to reinstitute, reactivate the then-pending suit in the Southern District of California, which the state parties had brought to determine the disputed boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.882" offset="822311">The United States and the tribes were granted interlocutory appeals by the Ninth Circuit on those two substantive issues, but when they reached the Ninth Circuit they resurrected their previously-abandoned sovereign immunity in standing defenses before the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.155" offset="891379">The Ninth Circuit held that the state party suit was essentially a suit to quiet title, to Indian trust lands, and therefore barred by the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.691" offset="941534">It also held that even if our suit were viewed as essentially a water rights suit, as we contend, that nevertheless the McCarran Amendment consent to suit provisions were inapplicable, because we were not seeking a complete adjudication of all the water rights in the lower Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.405" offset="1024395">And thirdly, it strongly indicated, but didn't decide, that Metropolitan lacked standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.312" offset="1048009">Let me emphasize what the state parties are seeking in their action.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.866" offset="1066295">As we indicated to this Court in 1983, and as it noted in its Arizona against California II opinion, we are not seeking to diminish or divest in any way the United States ownership interest of the disputed lands, nor are we seeking to disrupt the United States commitments to the tribes in setting aside those reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.610" offset="1157201">All we want is a fair judicial determination of what the appropriate boundaries of those reservations are so that we can delineate those federal public lands that don't have a water right from those Indian trust lands that may under this Court's decision, Arizona against California I, have an implied winner's reserve water right.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.507" offset="3784806">On the Administrative Procedure Act point, Section 702 provides for judicial review of federal agency action unless another statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids relief which is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.097" offset="3851157">Now, we think the Ninth Circuit's conclusion at the Quiet Title Act is such a suit is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.561" offset="3869025">The basic purpose of the Quiet Title Act, it's legislative history, it's language, all the decisions that have construed it over the last 16 years make it clear that it only applies to a suit by a party claiming a property interest in disputed lands in which the United States also claims a property interest, and secondly, that the plaintiff is seeking to diminish or divest the United States of that ownership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.088" offset="3979157">That's not the purpose of our suit, it can't be its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.731" offset="3993681">Since the Quiet Title Act is limited to such particular ownership disputes, it cannot impliedly forbid our action which does not seek such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.917" offset="4038507">Now, the genesis of the Quiet Title Act was a recommendation of the Public Land Law Review Commission in 1970 to the Congress that it waive sovereign immunity with respect to suits to quiet title in which there were claims by a private party against the United States for ownership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.409" offset="4108411">Now, the subsequent legislative development of the Quiet Title Act focused on ownership disputes, and there's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.436" offset="4148535">In all the cases since then, of the dozens of cases that have interpreted the Quiet Title Act none has ever applied the Quiet Title Act where the plaintiff was not seeking to diminish or divest the United States of its claimed ownership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.286" offset="4215931">Secondly, only one case has ever applied the Quiet Title Act where the plaintiff was not also claiming a property interest in its own right in those disputed lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.553" offset="4261071">Now, in contrast to the ownership focus of the Quiet Title Act, the Public Land Law Review Commission also recommended to Congress that it provide for judicial review of adjudications, public land adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.271" offset="4307882">And it noted at the same time that there was then pending before the Congress the recommendation of the administrative conference of the United States that Congress enact a broad waiver of sovereign immunity that was eventually enacted as Section 702 of the APA in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.184" offset="4375591">That makes it clear, if you carefully analyze these two statutes, that the Quiet Title Act applies only where a private party is asserting a property interest against the United States and seeking to divest the United States of its claimed ownership interest, but does not get involved with any other statutes, whereas the Administrative Procedure Act applies in situations where there is no challenge to underlying ownership of the United States but simply a challenge as to the way the United States has administered federal laws that apply to those public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.868" offset="4534311">Two distinct areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.500" offset="4540790">Careful analysis will show they deal with completely different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.091" offset="4555209">Now, the United States tries to blur the distinctions between the two acts in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.636" offset="4581332">But it's clear that they, government has recognized the distinction between the appropriate spheres of operation of the Quiet Title Act and the Administrative Procedure Act in three critical instances, as we point out in our briefs, during the legislative history of both the Quiet Title Act and Section 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.010" offset="4650818">And more recently in its briefs before this Court, in Block against North Dakota, on which they place such heavy reliance, we quote the portion of the brief which says, the APA doesn't relate to underlying boundary disputes, but of course it relates to review of agency action that violates statutory or Constitutional law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1589.459" offset="6508646">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.786" offset="6553995">I think it's important at the outset to make clear the nature and consequences of the lawsuit that petitioners, or that MWD in particular, has brought against the United States here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.902" offset="6598403">They seek an order to, a judicial order, setting aside the Secretary's determination of the proper boundary of the Indian reservation, and secondly request the Court to go ahead and decide de novo where the proper boundary of the reservation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.043" offset="6666948">The effect of determining where the boundary is is to determine whether the land within the boundary is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.501" offset="6708849">As a result, the consequence of this lawsuit with respect to the land at issue would be to affect both the United States' title and the tribe's title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.049" offset="6750958">The United States' title would be changed from fee simple... I mean, excuse me... from holding the land in trust for the tribe to fee simply absolute, and the tribes equitable interest in the land would be altogether extinguished, which would greatly disrupt the relationship between the United States and the tribe, which--</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.551" offset="6825041">Mr. Kneedler, do you think the position the government is taking now is consistent with the position that the government took in oral argument of the Arizona against California II in 1983?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1679.278" stopTime="1823.381">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1679.278" offset="6867882">--Yes I, yes I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.420" offset="6872480">Mr. Claiborne in the oral argument in that case, when questioned about the pending motion to dismiss in the District Court, noted that that had been, that there was a motion to dismiss that raised sovereign immunity defense, and he, there's some, I think, ambiguity in his response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.513" offset="6952832">Whether it's correctly transcribed or not is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.244" offset="6963804">But the page of the oral argument transcript that is reproduced in an appendix to the brief makes it pretty clear that Mr. Claiborne was contemplating that these issues, and particularly here sovereign immunity, would be litigated in the District Court, and would be subject to appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.844" offset="7030155">And that was apparently this Court's understanding because they did not, the Court's opinion in Arizona against California did not take the United States to have conceded the absence of, or the presence of jurisdiction in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.254" offset="7083862">And in fact the Court's opinion went on to acknowledge that the question of sovereign immunity among others would be litigated and subject to appellate review in the normal course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.080" offset="7119180">So our view is we think not inconsistent with what Mr. Claiborne said at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.423" offset="7148542">On the further question of the nature of this lawsuit, Petitioners concede that they have brought this lawsuit solely to determine water rights, not because of the nature of the land for its own sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.006" offset="7214788">And in fact they wouldn't have Article 3 standing to bring this suit for a determination of the status of the land because they claim no interest in the land itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.842" offset="7250210">As to the water rights, the effect would be rather dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.894" offset="7270377">What they seek is to divest the United States of its legal title, and the tribe of its equitable title, to the reserved water right that both claim was reserved by the United States when the land was set aside for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.395" offset="7332339">And finally it isn't true in this case that Petitioners seek nothing for themselves in the nature of a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.568" offset="7361074">They have brought this suit only because the effect of recognition of the reserved water right for the United States for these 3,500 acres on the Fort Mojave Reservation would be to subordinate their own, MWD's own water rights for the Indian... I mean for, under their contract with the Secretary of the Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.615" offset="7461280">And in fact the most important element of a water right, and their water right in particular, is its priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.549" offset="7484999">And so moving MWD's water right to a higher priority and moving the United States' water rights to the reservation to a lower priority very definitely transfers a property right from the United States to MWD in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.818" offset="7722086">But what led us to re-examine this were really three separate and we think important factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.674" offset="7749462">First of all, the United States holds this land in trust for the Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.556" offset="7769002">And in those circumstances it is important that the United States make sure that everything is done right, so that the question of title will be adjudicated properly in the proper forum, and in a way that no questions will be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.054" offset="7819053">Secondly, if the question of jurisdiction had not been litigated there would have been a real question as to whether any judgment in that case would be binding as a matter of res judicata, because a judgment entered by a court that does not have subject matter jurisdiction may be collaterally attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.784" offset="7877985">That wasn't speculative here, because the very purpose of MWD bringing this lawsuit was to take the judgment in this case and use it in finally resolving the water rights dispute in Arizona against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.133" offset="7927304">We wanted to make sure by actually litigating the question of jurisdiction that that question would be put to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.497" offset="7952800">Far from being dilatory on the question, we wanted to get that question resolved, so we would know where to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.780" offset="7973907">And in fact the purpose of taking an interlocutory appeal was to resolve it--</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.233" offset="8055722">And if the water rights are to be adjudicated in this Court in all other respects, we would submit that the element of the cause of action for a water right, whether the land is reserved, should also be adjudicated in Arizona against California in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.170" offset="8631461">I think it is, because the concluding portion of that first sentence in Subsection A says, other than an interest in water rights, which certainly contemplates that out for the water rights exception, water rights would be included within the general subject of interest in real property in which the United States claims an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.391" offset="8700424">And the reason for the exception for water rights in the Quiet Title Act, as we've explained in our briefs, is the Congress had already provided a special mechanism for the adjudication of water rights in which the United States claims an interest, and that's the so-called McCarran Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.451" offset="8768656">Yes, and Congress determined that it would only waive the immunity of the United States to suit involving water rights when there was a general stream adjudication, and for very good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.838" offset="8806168">Because if the United States were subject to piecemeal adjudication by every competing water user on the stream, it could be subject to a whole series of lawsuits, and the judgment in the first one wouldn't bind the parties to the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.238" offset="8863742">And Congress determined that the United States should be put to the task of defending its water rights only when all the users on the stream would be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.355" offset="8896238">In this case, this is in no sense a general stream adjudication, as the Court held in Dugan v. Rank, was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.106" offset="8923196">And the legislative history of both the Quiet Title Act and the Administrative Procedure Act that we set forth in pages 28 to 29 of our brief makes clear that Congress understood what it enacted both statutes that the McCarran Amendment was the existing procedure for the adjudication of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.498" offset="8992787">And because the McCarran Amendment does not permit an individual water user, such as MWD, to bring a suit to quiet title on water rights, it fails within the exception to the APA for another statute that grants consent to suit for McCarran Amendment but impliedly forbids the relief that is sought in this case, an adjudication of water rights as between the United States and only one claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.023" offset="9086932">So we think that as to the water rights aspect of it, that the McCarran Amendment itself bars it, and beyond that the Quiet Title Act creates an exception for water rights because of this pre-existing scheme for adjudication of water rights, and that the express exception in the Quiet Title Act for suits involving water rights leads to the conclusion that the waiver of sovereign immunity to APA simply doesn't permit a court to adjudicate this suit, because the relief that it sought, a determination of title to water rights, is expressly barred by the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.528" offset="9224963">So as to the water rights aspect of this case, which Petitioners concede is the central nature of this lawsuit, the water rights, adjudication of water rights is barred not once but twice by independent suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.873" offset="9274282">And precisely the sort of pre-existing self-contained statutory regimes that Congress had in mind when it enacted the APA amendments in 1976 and included this exception for other statutes that grant consent to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.835" offset="9338125">I would finally like to point out that although Petitioner asserts in its reply brief that we did not raise the water rights exception below, in pages 16 to 18 of our reply brief, in the Court of Appeals, we did in fact raise the water rights, address the water rights exception, precisely because, there as here, they argued that this is a suit about water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.648" offset="9413358">And in response to that we said, okay, if that's so then it's expressly barred by the water rights exception to the Quiet Title Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.693" offset="9505622">I think the Court of Appeals' problem was that to the extent that this, that Petitioners were characterizing their suit as a dispute about who owns the land, they had no interest in the land, and therefore were not, were not proper parties to such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.173" offset="9567480">And in fact this Court's decisions in Cragin v. Powell and Lane v.

            <text syncTime="2449.194" offset="9947614">And on that point the legislative history of the APA is also quite informative on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.778" offset="9973946">Because as we point out on page 28 of our brief, the administrative conference, which proposed the amendments that were eventually enacted in 1976 to Section 702 pointed out that special statutory schemes, such as the Tucker Act which permits certain remedies but not another, and another one in particular that was mentioned was special statutory regimes concerning water rights, will retain the same preclusive effect as they have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.530" offset="10104976">And this Court had already held, prior to that time, in Dugan v. Rank, that only a general stream adjudication is one within the United States waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.158" offset="10151474">Any other suit was already precluded by Dugan v. Rank and the McCarran Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.727" offset="10937760">And incidentally, there are four non-Indian inholdings within the disputed 3,500-acre tract in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.102" offset="10959180">And those landowners would have a right to bring an action under the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.805" offset="10977988">But Petitioner, Petitioner claims because does not, because they're not seeking title, this suit isn't addressed by the Quiet Title Act, and therefore they should be permitted to bring it under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.241" offset="11023755">Precisely the opposite conclusion should be drawn from the fact that they're not claiming title, because if Congress intended the Indian lands exception to prevent even a claimant to the land in question to bring a suit that would disrupt the United States relationship with the Indians, then a fortiori Congress must have intended to preclude a suit by a stranger to the land dispute from bringing an action that would affect, really being an inter-meddler, affect the interests of the United States and the Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.611" offset="11141201">And there's no reason to think that Congress expected that, and in fact Congress deliberately confined the Quiet Title Act to suits brought by people who are themselves claiming an interest in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.877" offset="11186341">And that is made clear by the provision of the Quiet Title Act that requires the plaintiff to set forth with particularity the nature of the interest he claims in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.244" offset="11219778">Because not just as Indian lands, but with respect to lands generally, Congress did not want the United States title to be adjudicated by people who weren't themselves claiming competing title in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.422" offset="11264499">Finally, with respect to the argument that the United States waived its immunity by intervening in Arizona against California, Petitioners concede there's no authority for that, and in fact the rationale of the Thekla rule upon which they rely suggests that there shouldn't be an extension of that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.430" offset="11320506">Thekla involved resolving all aspects of a single case in the same court to resolve the same controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.035" offset="11346942">They are in fact seeking to split off one element of the cause of action and bring it in another court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.069" offset="11371079">That's not only inconsistent with the rationale of Thekla, but it's also inconsistent with the policy of Congress in this Court to have comprehensive adjudication of water rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.589" offset="11733136">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.563" offset="11757064">The tribes urge dismissal of this action based upon the United States' sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.095" offset="11783187">It's important to understand the effect of this dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.199" offset="11799591">Dismissal will not affect or deprive the Petitioners of their right to judicial review with respect to their specific interest and concern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.299" offset="11852045">As the Petitioners have repeatedly asserted, their sole concern in this case is with their water allocation in Arizona v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.824" offset="11890080">Petitioners are protected in their right to review of that interest, because this Court in 1983 stated very clearly that before the water rights of the tribes are increased, based upon additional boundary acreage, that the Petitioners will have their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.237" offset="11971791">So the tribes' position is not that the Petitioners are being deprived of their, that dismissal will deprive the Petitioners of their judicial review of the boundary orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.055" offset="12015049">What we're saying is that this particular action cannot go forward, and this particular action cannot be the forum for that review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.753" offset="12129779">Well, there are a couple of responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.404" offset="12140437">The first is Mr. Kneedler has stated that we realized that there was an Indian lands exception Quiet Title Act sovereign immunity defense that might have prevented the Court from having jurisdiction, does prevent the Court from having jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.845" offset="12202191">And we did not want to have a judgment in the District Court that has no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.450" offset="12228627">And secondly, we realized that Petitioners' real interest in this case is their water rights, and that we're having scope of review and procedural problems in the District Court because of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.976" offset="12278677">They were litigating a water rights issue, their water rights claim in the District Court, but the lawsuit was challenging the tribes' title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.573" offset="12309084">Now, the proper forum for that is where the parties are claiming the water rights, and that's in Arizona v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.967" offset="12338654">The action is... the District Court is not the forum for resolution of the boundary issues because it's barred by the Indian lands exception to the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.265" offset="12387869">As this Court is aware from its previous decisions in Block v. North Dakota, and United States v. Mottaz, the Indian lands exception insulates trust or restricted Indian lands from challenges by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.533" offset="12444920">Congress, in the Quiet Title Act, lifted its sovereign immunity generally for claims against the United States for public Federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.152" offset="12487448">But Congress in the Indian lands exception made a conscious decision to retain its immunity for trust or restricted Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.627" offset="12521302">And it made that decision based upon the specific commitments and the solemn obligations of the United States to protect Indian lands from challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.835" offset="12566129">It was based upon the United States trust responsibility towards Indians to protect their lands, and it was based upon a recognition that over the course of history Indians had lost a great deal of their traditional historic lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.994" offset="12626733">And Congress included that provision because it did not want Indian lands to be subject to any further challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.930" offset="12654527">The Indian lands exception is invoked when the United States holds lands in trust and claims them on behalf of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.277" offset="12699876">There's no requirement, as the Petitioners have asserted in this case, that the United States must prove that its claim is substantial before the exception is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.144" offset="12747418">That requirement would be at odds with and undermine the Indian lands exception purpose, and the purpose behind sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.830" offset="12782109">The purpose behind the doctrine of immunity is to prevent examination of the merits of the government's claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.475" offset="13768702">Congress was not concerned with who the parties who were challenging the land were, it was concerned with preventing loss of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.872" offset="13802347">It doesn't make any sense to say that a party with a lesser interest, such as the Petitioners, are entitled to challenge Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.106" offset="13831187">And it also doesn't make any difference that the lands would still be held by the United States as BLM public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.542" offset="13860966">The fact is that the essential character of the lands would be completely altered if Petitioners succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.556" offset="13897015">The United States would be divested of its, of its legal interest in the property, the tribes would be stripped entirely of their equitable interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.283" offset="13935990">And finally, the Petitioners cannot utilize the waiver in Section 702 of the APA to avoid the Indian lands exception.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome C. Muys</label>
            <text syncTime="3510.266" offset="14191885">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.106" offset="14199200">Just dealing with the McCarran Act issue for a moment, the United States wants the Court to give the same effect to the McCarran Amendment that it gave to the Quiet Title Act as being the exclusive means of having any kind of adjudication on water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.206" offset="14263670">In other words, it wants the Court to say, the McCarran Amendment has preempted the field, there's no other way you can test a federal agency action that may just affect water rights short of a whole general stream adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.963" offset="14310690">We think that that argument has to overcome at least three decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.717" offset="14329707">In Dugan against Rank, where private water rights owners challenged the operation of the Central Valley project, the Court said the McCarran Amendment wasn't applicable, but they applied the officer suit test to see whether the suit against the officials was appropriate, unlike block against North Dakota where the Court said that there's no room for an officer suit in light of the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.330" offset="14412150">So at least in Dugan against Rank, the Court seemed to feel that the McCarran Amendment had not completely preempted the field.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3571.074" offset="14435138">But Dugan was before the enactment of Quiet Title Act, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_c_muys" startTime="3574.878" stopTime="3625.721">
            <label>Mr. Jerome C. Muys</label>
            <text syncTime="3574.878" offset="14450289">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.656" offset="14453423">And before the APA waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.319" offset="14460111">But at least they recognized that there was another means of getting at federal officials interfering with water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.073" offset="14483098">And then in the Colorado River Conservation District Number One against United States in 1976 and Arizona against San Carlos Apache tribes in 1983, the Court said that the McCarran Amendment was not the exclusive vehicle for testing water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.573" offset="14541090">Those cases turned on jurisdictional issues, whether the United States and Indian tribes could bring water right actions in the federal district court, even though there might be a general stream adjudication under the McCarran Act, either going on or threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.152" offset="14603366">And so it seemed to us that there's certainly an implication in those cases, again, that the McCarran Act had not preempted the field of all water rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.868" offset="14638266">It preempts the field on general stream adjudications, but there's still leeway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.721" offset="14653730">Well, maybe all we meant was that there are other ways to test water rights without suing the United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3633.526" offset="14684868">I mean, we're just talking here about a preclusion of suit against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome C. Muys</label>
            <text syncTime="3637.069" offset="14699079">--Well, the Indian claims, though, in Arizona against San Carlos Apache, were claims brought in the federal district court against the United States and all other water users, because many times the United States has water rights on behalf of other federal agencies that are inconsistent with Indian claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.528" offset="14764907">So I'm quite sure, in San Carlos Apache, the suit involved claims by the tribes against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.353" offset="14792179">No problems were suggested about a lack of waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.835" offset="14810151">So we think that the McCarran Act does not fit the mold of the Quiet Title Act, as interpreted in Block against North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.671" offset="14837528">We suggested the Ninth Circuit could squeeze our case under the McCarran Amendment because it was as comprehensive an action as is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.235" offset="14867725">This Court had already done a general stream adjudication on the lower Colorado River in Arizona against California I, was still retaining complete jurisdiction over all the water rights on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.122" offset="14907327">All that were left were the three unadjudicated boundary disputes on the three reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.306" offset="14931987">So, as this Court said in the Eagle County case, the McCarran Amendment should not be interpreted inflexibly and narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.650" offset="14957378">We sought as comprehensive adjudication as possible.</text>
