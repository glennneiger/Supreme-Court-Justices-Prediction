            <label>Mr. Joseph W. Womack</label>
            <text syncTime="43.577" offset="314339">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these petitions respectfully ask you to consider two of the Federal rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="390303">The first is 803, having to do with the use of Government reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.696" offset="430741">The second is a different rule, namely 106, concerning contemporaneous publication of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.206" offset="488837">This, as the Court will know, is essentially a codification of Dean Wigmore's completeness formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.597" offset="534394">Implicit in the second point, if the Court please, is also a different, a third rule, namely, 801, and I say implicit because it is triggered by a footnote in the panel opinion of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.045" offset="632197">With regard to 803, namely, the Government report rule, a moment or two, please, of background.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.670" offset="682666">In mid-July of 1982, a tragic accident involving the loss of a Navy trainer, sadly, we lost a pilot and a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.993" offset="731985">The following day, the squadron commander convened separate investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.416" offset="769706">The one in question here is the JAG investigation commenced pursuant to the Judge Advocate General's manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.122" offset="808471">Subsequently suits were filed, diversity suits were filed, in the Northern District of Florida, consolidated for handling discovery and trial of bifurcated proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.949" offset="859776">With trial in mid-July of 1984, it was during that trial that I offered, as an exhibit for the jury, certain portions of the JAG officer's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.076" offset="932292">Historically, I think I had brought that matter to the District Judge's notice several months before the trial, at least four months before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.503" offset="989970">The Court considered the matter, brief were filed, it was considered orally and in memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.740" offset="1018914">The Court ultimately concluded that of the 31 factual findings in the JAG report, that it would admit or allow me to use four.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.047" offset="1068233">Of the nine conclusions or opinions contained in the JAG report, the District Judge admitted one.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.205" offset="1112850">For convenience, I think the full text of the total report, that is, the factual findings and the conclusions, are set out in the Beech petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.251" offset="1180977">And I raise this purely as a matter of clarify, because the en banc opinion and the panel opinion below both say... and I think respectfully, erroneously, assume... that all of the report was admitted, and that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.766" offset="1275018">So if you take the joint appendix, you have what the Court assumed to have been admitted, and you take the petition and you have the exact document that was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.090" offset="1328308">Actually, after the Court's ruling, I simply had it retyped, so as not in the heat of trial to admit anything that the Court didn't want admitted and use it as a blow-up exploded exhibit for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.499" offset="1382016">The specific bone of contention, if I may put it that way, is a statement by the JAG officer in his conclusions that the probable cause of this tragedy was the pilot's failure to maintain proper interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.247" offset="1464981">And by that he means, of course, a violation of the distances required by pattern integrity and not touch and go pattern with training squadron.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.805" offset="1511270">At the time of the accident, parenthetically, there were six airplanes in the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.708" offset="1538855">Immediately before there had been five, and when the sixth airplane entered the pattern, this tragedy occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.647" offset="1570620">The Court of Appeals of my Circuit... the panel took it away from me, took the verdict away from me.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.157" offset="1632582">There was a special concurrence by second Judge Frank Johnson, suggesting that the Court take it en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.632" offset="1674483">We petitioned, the Court recalled the panel opinion, ordered new briefs filed, and ultimately considered the case further without argument, but on new briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.039" offset="1732161">The en banc Court split six-six on the issue of whether or not the conclusion of the JAG officer classified or called, denominated, if you will, an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.865" offset="1783466">Relying, if the Court please, on a borrowed case... and I say borrowed because it relied on a Fifth Circuit case which had been decided prior to the creation of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.911" offset="2163599">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, just before the recess, I had suggested that the Court of Appeals had made an erroneous assumption, and so that the Court will not think that I am making that assumption, that's what the Court says in the en banc opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.907" offset="2243639">In one of the footnotes, you'll notice that Judge Tjoflat says that they did not have the exhibits before them.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.982" offset="2299959">I simply say that that's what he says in the opinion, and that accounts for the discrepancy in what was admitted, what the jury saw, versus what the Court of Appeals thought had been put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.776" offset="2367146">Lastly, just before the recess, I suggested that the Court had borrowed a Fifth Circuit case.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.337" offset="3149356">And those things, rather than the agency or scope of employment of the Government investigator, would give a more trustworthy foundation for the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.244" offset="3197003">Moving quickly, if I may, to the generic issue, whether this Court will permit us to use probable cause conclusions, I ask your approval for that use.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.940" offset="3267743">And I ask you to consider several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.344" offset="3281327">First, they are certainly not binding on anybody in a judicial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.116" offset="3316435">The committee recommends their use, most of the circuits permit their use, and indeed in the Fifth and the Second Circuit, while there are cases going in both directions, they are permitted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.196" offset="3404834">Most of the evidence professors say that we should be able to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.850" offset="3423433">Gainsaid, that's not binding on this Court, obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.652" offset="3438584">But there are some very good policy reasons for doing so, quite aside from what the evidence professors might have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.991" offset="3471916">Some cases of necessity cost... the sheer volume of paperwork generated by business and Government today is just overpowering, and so I submit in the most respectful terms that we, who try cases, need to be able to use in some form some portions of Government documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.623" offset="3570450">However strict the Court might feel on trustworthiness before you allow us to use them, that's a matter for the Court, and not for us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.363" offset="9553431">The case of Zenith v. Matsushita, which was cited in all the briefs, makes that statement that factual findings is a term broad enough to encompass any statement of fact that represents a conclusion on the part of the investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.372" offset="9621454">Now, Lieutenant Commander Morgan after going beyond the findings of fact then lists his opinions, and makes it clear in his scenario of the opinions that it is impossible for him to know for a fact how the accident happened, why it happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.522" offset="9730123">"Because both pilots were killed in the crash, and because of the nearly total destruction of the aircraft by fire, it is impossible... almost impossible... to determine exactly what happened. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.461" offset="9765859">He goes on to engage in what he calls a possible scenario, which is what he later calls his probable cause opinion: he sets up the scenario that the pilot, surprised by the presence of another aircraft, race a hard right turn and put the aircraft in stall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.655" offset="9830643">He then goes on to say that the most probable cause was just that possible scenario that I've just cited, and states also,</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.730" offset="9882888">And to address the question that was raised during Beech's presentation, the judge initially ruled, and had ruled in his pre-trial order up until the day after jury selection and the day before the first witness, that only what Lieutenant Commander Morgan had called his factual findings would come into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.507" offset="9950074">He said that opinions would have no place in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.609" offset="9962404">Then he reversed that, and as Beech pointed out, we were given the opportunity for that short period of time to try to do what we could to attack trustworthiness, which we had made clear we thought was an issue with respect to opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.952" offset="10019769">He stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.487" offset="10025934">"I will not allow all opinions in, only to the extent they're couched in the terms of probability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.724" offset="10050907">because in Florida, and I think in other States, experts are not entitled to opine on what they think possibly could have happened, only what they think probably happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.388" offset="10437519">Points that the cases, and the commentators point to the fact that the investigator can interview witnesses before the parties have pulled them to one side or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.565" offset="10498228">That simply says that that's why this investigator's findings may be something that we should admit, and oftentimes the officer is trained in doing this kind of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.020" offset="10540128">But none of these purposes speak to and encourage that this factual findings language should be extended to include all opinion, and simply leave it up to the opponent to say, well, if the opinion's not trustworthy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.033" offset="12596174">First, under Smith v. Ithaca, which is a very strict construction approach which we urge on this Court, any opinion doesn't come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.806" offset="12623237">The second point which has become... I've allowed it to become kind of confused, and I apologize... is that even if you adopt the Senate view, the Advisory Committee view, that evaluative reports come in, that they even suggest there should be some limit on the kind of opinion, call it opinion, that should come in as a factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.386" offset="12709546">And that's why I pointed the Court to the kinds of things the Advisory Committee said should be a helpful guide, and they talk about some very easy-to-resolve questions of would this be the kind of thing that anyone would really disagree with, is what I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.412" offset="12773598">If they had intended for this rule to be a vehicle to place in this kind of opinion... pure opinion... then I think that they should have said that, and I think that this Court, as the Supreme Court of this land, ought to be cautious in, by implication of a rule or a statute, extending it to the point that very important rights of cross-examination are cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.450" offset="12893761">And that's what Beech is urging this Court to do, is to take this rule of factual finding--</text>
