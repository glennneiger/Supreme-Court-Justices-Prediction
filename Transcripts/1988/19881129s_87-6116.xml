            <text syncTime="9.374" offset="123946">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Ohio Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.887" offset="142023">It involves an application of our decision in Anders against California, a case we decided about 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.219" offset="171385">Petitioner is an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.986" offset="178386">After a jury convicted him of several serious crimes, counsel was appointed to represent him on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.057" offset="202732">The lawyer, however, did not file an appellate brief but instead filed a motion seeking leave to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.385" offset="231989">Although the motion simply asserted that in reviewing the record, counsel found no reversible errors and although the Court of Appeals did not itself examine the record to confirm counsel's conclusion, the court granted counsel leave to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.391" offset="288100">Subsequently, upon ultimately reviewing the record for error, the Court of Appeals found several arguable claims that it did not appoint a new lawyer to represent the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.773" offset="333553">As more fully explained in an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court, we conclude that under our decision in Anders, counsel should not have been permitted to withdraw and that in any event, after finding that the record presented several arguable claims, the Court of Appeals should certainly have appointed a new lawyer to represent the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.536" offset="408681">We further hold that under our relevant decisions, the error in this case was neither harmless nor non-prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.718" offset="433341">The judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming petitioner’s conviction is therefore reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.128" offset="463016">Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring statement, and the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
