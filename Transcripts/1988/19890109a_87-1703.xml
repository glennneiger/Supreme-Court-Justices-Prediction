            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141069">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1703, Dale Robertson v Methow Valley Citizens Council and a companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="200106">Mr. Fried, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="19.878" offset="220481">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.996" offset="233020">This Court, in a series of cases, has made quite clear what NEPA does and does not requires NEPA requires analysis and disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.369" offset="270532">It requires that the agency take a hard look at environmental effects of proposed action, and public participation and assurance that this hard look has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="306999">It does not require... and CEQ regulations make this clear... more and more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.481" offset="334898">More is not necessary more... more.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.766" offset="344093">Sometimes it is less.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.266" offset="350049">That is why this Court imposes page limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.235" offset="361960">The function of the environmental impact statement is to inform the decision maker, not to bullet-proof him against obstructionist litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="400831">Furthermore, the... the Court has made quite clear what NEPA does not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.810" offset="420266">It does not impose any substantive environmental requirements, nor does it dictate the relative weights to be given to environmental as opposed to other concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.332" offset="466346">In this respect, it's worth contrasting NEPA with the Endangered Species Act or Section 4(f) of the Transportation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.022" offset="501141">The court of appeals in these cases ignored these general precepts in overturning not only the agency's decisions, but those of reviewing district courts, and it made two specific legal errors common to both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.132" offset="561536">First, it demanded that the agency not just discuss and consider mitigation opportunities, but that it commit in the plan to complete and effective mitigation measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.759" offset="624021">The Respondents should not be allowed to hide behind the confusion that this substantive obligation is put forward as a requirement of what is supposed to be an analytic and descriptive document.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="133.217" offset="673862">Mr. Fried, may I inquire of you?</text>
            <text syncTime="136.503" offset="687028">The statutory language of NEPA says that the agency has to describe in detail the adverse environmental effects which can't be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.493" offset="734989">Now, in this case do you think that a mere listing of possible mitigating measures without any consideration or discussion of how they might be employed would suffice to meet that statutory language?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="165.938" stopTime="238.570">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="804788">Justice O'Connor, I think here as throughout what governs is the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.342" offset="830388">And the more significant the environmental impact and the more important the mitigation, of course, the greater the obligation to go into detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.400" offset="874587">This is very well illustrated by one of the things out of which the court of appeals made such heavy weather, which was the wildlife in the Marsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.189" offset="913771">That's the Elk Creek Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.724" offset="919936">In that case there were substantial environmental impacts in respect to the turbidity of the water, the muddying of the water, downstream from the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.615" offset="971449">But also, the dam was going to flood 1300 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.186" offset="989735">And we were faulted because we did not go into great detail about what we were going to do for... and here, it's worth listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.109" offset="1033412">We had 50 deer, a smaller number of elks, coyotes, otter skunks and 125 quail whose habitat was going to be flooded by that lake Now, we did not go into a great deal of detail about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="238.570" stopTime="240.586">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="238.570" offset="1095270">Well, in fact, no detail, wouldn't you agree--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="240.586" stopTime="268.505">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="240.586" offset="1103316">No, I don't think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.372" offset="1110525">What we said... we committed to spend $350,000 in cultivating what are called "edges" which is variations in foliage height because that is a more agreeable habitat for those animals which had been observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.234" offset="1185967">It's not clear that they were going to be somehow wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.138" offset="1201536">It's a little bit like Noah's ark, except that reminds me when--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="268.505" offset="1215015">--Well, the, the, the point I'm just trying to make is is it enough in your view to just list possible mitigating actions as a list without in any way attempting to say this one could be successful, we think it will be, it will do thus and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.401" offset="1286591">Do you have to go beyond just a mere sketchy little list?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="290.186" offset="1301742">--Oh, I think you do for anything of significance.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="296.257" offset="1326088">xxx point it's just this is so insignificant they didn't have to do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="299.875" stopTime="355.611">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="299.875" offset="1340507">--Well, they did do a little bit more than that, but you have to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.363" offset="1358480">How significant is the impact and, therefore, how much do you have to say about what you're going to do about the impact?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.968" offset="1388886">And when you see the mountain that was made out of this mole hill, you understand that this is just a charter for obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.455" offset="1422845">When we talk about serious impacts, such as air quality in the other case, the... the Forest Service case, then you've got to go into more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.198" offset="1473836">But when you're talking about a few animals that had been observed and the lake is rising, the waters will rise, and so you're going to do a little bit for them, but you're not making a big deal out of something that isn't a big deal, I think to say that you have to go into excessive detail there is exactly what CEQ was focusing on.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="355.611" offset="1563489">I take it that we're in... that the circuit court and the district court are in the same position?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.932" offset="1584700">The circuit court doesn't defer to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.151" offset="1597657">They each engage in the same kind of review?</text>

            <text syncTime="368.371" offset="1614480">Well, the circuit court should certainly defer to the district court insofar as the district court held a trial and established facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.592" offset="1751361">Well, I... I was concerned about that because in... in the Marsh case involving the Elk Creek Dam, the court made findings that the government was continuing to study wildlife mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.202" offset="1805800">And it seems to me that the record is either closed or it isn't closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.304" offset="1818235">--Well, in Marsh there were several things that happened that shouldn't have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.292" offset="1838192">In Marsh the Kramer memorandum and the things which are supposed to have set off some of these insufficiencies were raised at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.682" offset="1891796">They were not raised at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.915" offset="1900677">It reminds one very much of Vermont Yankee, where it's a little bit of an ambush.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.086" offset="1921366">Now, the standard of review quite clearly should be APA review.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.275" offset="1958147">Was the agency arbitrary and capricious, first of all, in its decision, of course, and second, in its approach to what it does and does not include in the environmental impact statement?</text>

            <text syncTime="522.086" offset="2229402">In Robertson you have... in respect to the on-site effects of building the ski slope, there is the question about whether the location of the roads and the slopes and the towers and the... and the ski trails will interfere with the mule deer.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.849" offset="2312367">And as to tiering, what the agency did is to say these are problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.153" offset="2337653">We understand they're problems, but we want to see the master plan first before we decide whether they are going to interfere with the mule deer.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.561" offset="2383211">And that's a rather small scale version of what we saw in the Kleppe case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.583" offset="4455348">There is another matter here, which it's important to get before the Court, which relates to the worst case analysis, because the Ninth Circuit in both cases clearly demanded that in respect to uncertainties and, indeed, matters which were simply matters in dispute where we took one view and the opponents took another, that there must be a worst case analysis, that we must assume the worst in analyzing the effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.620" offset="4583453">Now, we ask the Court to rule that that is incorrect as a matter of law because the court of appeals thought that that obligation derived from NEPA itself rather than from CEQ regulations which have now been superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.266" offset="4662133">And as applied, we believe, that these are not proper cases for uncertainty analysis at all even under the new CEQ regs because what we have is not uncertainty, what we have is a dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.285" offset="4774147">If the Ninth Circuit is to be believed, there is always an obligation to analyze the effects as if the opponents, the people who see this in the most dramatic and drastic lights, are correct and to analyze on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.562" offset="4843214">That can't be what CEQ meant in either the old or the new regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.076" offset="5553327">Twenty years ago Congress enacted the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and imposed new procedures on all federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.599" offset="5587391">The purpose was to ensure full consideration of environmental actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.401" offset="5606617">And the method was the preparation of an environmental impact statement, a statement which Congress said is to be "detailed".</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.907" offset="5640680">Compliance is to be "to the fullest extent possible".</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.644" offset="5659593">Congress' mandate to the agencies in the vernacular was look before you leap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.132" offset="5681536">And this Court has said that look must be a hard look.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.350" offset="5702434">The impact statements here do not meet the standards that Congress established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.987" offset="5720929">Unsupported conclusions and wish lists do not meet the detail requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.574" offset="5747365">And sweeping under the rug difficult issues that are indicated from significant new information and uncertainty does not meet Congress' requirement to study the environmental consequences to the fullest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.603" offset="5811417">That these impact statements do not meet Congress' standards was recognized not only by the courts below, but by state and federal agencies with special expertise in environmental issues and by 29 states that have joined in an amicus brief in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.362" offset="5878499">The essence of the Solicitor General's argument is that the standards established by Congress should be relaxed by this Court, that unsupported conclusions and incomplete analysis should suffice despite... despite Congress saying we want detail and compliance to fullest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.792" offset="5964181">Because Congress established these standards, it is only Congress that can relieve the agencies of their responsibility to comply with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.151" offset="8505582">Because NEPA provides a continuing responsibility for the agencies to take into account environmental factors, their responsibilities do not end with the filing of an impact statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.560" offset="13223296">--But only as to specific matters about the combined effects of all three dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.166" offset="13257673">We didn't think that was an issue which was worth bringing to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.868" offset="13272511">What we would a strongly urge is that there be no remand on any of the matters subject to the litigation here because we are concerned not only about the two specific legal issues, which I take the Respondents to have conceded, but we are concerned about the approach of the court of appeals here which is just unduly persnickety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.768" offset="13376060">We are told that there is a wish list, and that "wish list" phrase occurs in the Elk Creek Dam case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.474" offset="13414930">And I must say the only thing to which that nice phrase can apply is those skunks and coyotes and so on that have been flooded out, and it seems inappropriate to say this is an insufficiently detailed mitigation statement because it's just a wish list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.370" offset="13498522">So, we would require guidance not only on the legal issues which have been conceded, but also on the appropriate approach, and we think the approach of the Ninth Circuit here has not been appropriate because on mitigation... on mitigation you have three kinds of things bearing on reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.153" offset="13585667">First of all, just how significant is the impact and can't you tailor your discussion to how big a deal you've got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.841" offset="13624432">Second, there is the issue of tiering which is the question of is the issue ripe for detailed discussion or is general conceptual discussion sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.833" offset="13676364">And finally, the discussion should appropriately take into account who it is that is going to be doing the mitigation, and if it's state and local authorities that are going to be doing it, then the kind of discussion is appropriately more conceptual than it would be if the actual decision maker would be the one asked to do the mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.800" offset="13776256">And this is all just spinning out the rule of reason as to the detail of the mitigation statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.887" offset="13808543">In other words, it musn't be forced to be so detailed that it ceases to be useful to the decision maker and just becomes a kind of a mine field which the agency has to try somehow to negotiate lest it blow up on them at suit, at trial, perhaps indeed in a court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.169" offset="14093696">And we have thought that issue all by itself is not worth bothering the Court with because it may be rather verbal.</text>
