            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You may proceed, Mr. Graybill.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>Thank you, Justice Brennan, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case is here on appeal from a judgment of the Ninth Circuit after remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of its decision last term in Tashjian v. the Republican Party of Connecticut.</text>
            <text>The primary question presented is whether California can, consistent with the First Amendment, protect the right of members of a state political party to control their party through their votes in the primary election conducted and financed by the state.</text>
            <text>One of the challenged statutes enables party members to use the primary election to choose democratically the candidates who have the endorsement of the party in the general election for partisan office, and another set of challenged statutes enables the endorsed candidates as the chosen representatives of the party to be members of the party State Central Committee.</text>
            <text>And this afternoon I'd like to address two general points.</text>
            <text>The first is that the invalidated statutes promote strong and fundamental California interests in establishing a thoroughly open and democratic process for selecting its public officials; and the separate but related interest of establishing government which is stable and has the acceptance of its citizens.</text>
            <text>And the final interest is in the prevention of fraud.</text>
            <text>And the second general notion that we'd like to address is that on the record below, the invalidation of the statutes violates this Court's admonition, repeated most recently in Tashjian, that a court should not interfere with the First Amendment rights, the expression of First Amendment rights merely because it believes them to be unwise or irrational.</text>
            <text>Now, California's overriding and fundamental interest in these statutes is in an open and democratic system of selecting its government officials, and this interest reflects the evolution of values manifested by the amendments to the United States Constitution and decisions of this Court and of California's own constitution which expand the franchise and permit more direct participation by the citizens of this country in the selection of their officers and the determination of policy.</text>
            <text>Some of those constitutional amendments that reflect this value are the elimination of the disenfranchise of black persons in this country by the Fifteenth Amendment, the direct election of United States Senators and the extension of the vote to women.</text>
            <text>And court... decisions of this Court of a general nature which reflect this are the decisions affecting one person, on vote and the restrictions on gerrymandering.</text>
            <text>And the California constitution--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Excuse me.</text>
            <text>I don't understand what this has to do with preventing a party central committee from making a recommendation to the party membership.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>--The... Justice Scalia, it does not prevent the members of the committee from communicating with their party.</text>
            <text>What it does is protect to the members of the party the right to participate directly in the choice of candidates without having that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, couldn't they participate with the recommendation as well?</text>
            <text>I mean, they are just talking about the right to know what the recommendation of the committee as a committee is.</text>
            <text>Then they'll be able to accept it or reject it.</text>
            <text>Why is that undemocratic?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>--Well, Justice Scalia, the choice, the representation being made on behalf of the committee is typically that this is the party's candidate, and the effect that that can often have is that the choices available to the rest of the members of the party in the primary election are restricted.</text>
            <text>We have a phenomenon in California that's caused a great deal of irritation, the election returns on the national level are reported before our polls close, and it's been established by objective evidence that that affects the turnout in elections.</text>
            <text>And we don't get the participation of as many citizens in our election process when they think that their options have been foreclosed, that it's over.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that's another case.</text>
            <text>You don't want this case to hinge on whether it would be constitutional to prevent election returns from being announced in California, assuming that they are available?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>No, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text>What we are attempting to demonstrate by that analogy is that the tendency for an endorsement by what purports to be the party, and in California in fact is not the party, the party expresses itself in the primary election.</text>
            <text>That's what the primary election system is all about.</text>
            <text>The party leaders--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It's one thing to outlaw the smoke-filled room and it's another thing to prevent me from knowing what the people in the smoke-filled room would recommend.</text>
            <text>Isn't that something quite different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>--That doesn't prevent you, Justice Scalia, from knowing what the people in the smoke-filled room recommend.</text>
            <text>They have other means of access through, for example, membership in the California Democratic Council, our declarant, Senator Rodda, indicated any number of unofficial groups of party that get together and make their views known to the electorate.</text>
            <text>This restriction is so minuscule with regard to the First Amendment rights of the individual members of the executive committees or the county central committees or the State Central Committees, the means available to them other than creating the false impression that they speak for the party are readily available.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you're saying we should validate it because it isn't needed?</text>
            <text>I don't understand that.</text>
            <text>You say it's minuscule, you can find out other ways, so it's really not important.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>Well, it is important, Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And so you're here at the Supreme Court to defend it because it's not important?</text>
            <text>I don't understand that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>Well, that is definitely not the case, and the reason it is important is that in California, in the direct primary system, the party, per se, speaks by its vote in the primary election.</text>
            <text>When an official organ of the party, which under the charter of the party, which is reflected in these statutes, precludes them from making those endorsements, you have not only the mandate of the party that created these committees that these committees not try to speak for the party or to restrict the numbers of candidates and options available to the party in the primary election is a justifiable and overriding state interest, and it is narrowly construed to... it is narrowly fashioned not to infringe on the First Amendment rights of individual party leaders to express their views.</text>
            <text>They are just restricted from committing the fraud that exists by virtue of the existence of the California Democratic... the California primary election system.</text>
            <text>The parties speak at the primary with regard to who their endorsed candidates are to be for the general election and who the party leadership is to be.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Didn't the party, the Democratic Party, change its by-laws or requirements after the Ninth Circuit acted here to permit pre-primary endorsements by the committee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text>I think we should be more precise there.</text>
            <text>The executive board of the State Central Committee of the Democratic Party, by a vote which is not clear but could have been as few as 32 out of over 1000 members, decided that matter.</text>
            <text>They did not present it to a vote of the full committee as was the case in Tashjian, and we really don't know what the position of the party is on that.</text>
            <text>I don't think that would be a fair reflection--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Excuse me.</text>
            <text>Was it an effective vote?</text>
            <text>Are you denying that it was an effective vote, binding on the committee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_lloyd_graybill">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>--Under the by-laws, Justice Scalia, as we understand them of the State Central Committee, that would be permissible, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It was permissible.</text>
            <text>So once again you're, you're trying to impose upon the party some other rule about what, what the... how the party takes action.</text>
            <text>If the Democratic Party of California says 32 votes does it in those circumstances, 32 votes does it, and you're coming and tell us that it doesn't do it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>What we are explicating here is that does not reflect the will of the party necessarily.</text>
            <text>There is a process that has been gone through to establish these reforms through the political process.</text>
            <text>In other words, interest in the parties, one of their parties organized through the direct primary system, the progressives, the much maligned progressives, they established those things in statute.</text>
            <text>The members of the party here that disagree have been unsuccessful in persuading their parties in general, and I think we have to look here that the organization of a party is not the party, per se.</text>
            <text>There are other elements to it.</text>
            <text>There are the, the members of the party elected to the official positions in state government and in the national legislature--</text>

            <text>It appears... and we have to acknowledge that under the circumstances that this case has gotten here, the record isn't as complete as we would like, but we believe that the mechanism of a change in the by-laws and a submission to the legislature which determines... these are people that were nominated by members of the party in the primary election and elected... make a determination of whether this really is reflective of the will of the party.</text>

            <text>The State of California, as has been shown in the record before Your Honors, dictates what political parties can say, and Indeed, who it is, at least by office, that will say it.</text>
            <text>And in doing such, the state aggrieves the First Amendment in some very serious respects.</text>

            <text>Secondly, it goes to the subject matter.</text>
            <text>It is not content-neutral.</text>
            <text>It bans all political endorsements by all parties.</text>
            <text>Third, it applies not only to mature parties such as the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, but also one of my clients here, the State Libertarian Party, who is forbidden from endorsing candidates by one of the sections which is before Your Honors.</text>

            <text>There's tremendous confusion, tremendous animosity and difficulties, and as a matter of fact, not only is the party, say, the Republican Party, not free to endorse a candidate, but as happened to the Democratic Party, a member, a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan was nominated in San Diego to be the Democratic candidate for Congress, as the record shows, and the Democratic Party was not only forced by the law of California to be silent, it could say nothing, but he automatically qualified to become a member of the State Committee.</text>

            <text>The rest of the rights that were involved in that case... and this was the reason for its reversal... was that all of the other provisions came from the Democratic Party, I think it was the Democratic Party itself.</text>

            <text>But there's no other state, there is no other state that we can find that has any such limitation, and if... say the Libertarian Party, for example, comes up, as indeed they may, with a vigorous, vigorous, vibrant leader who is able to increase their votes from 2 percent to 4 percent to 6 percent.</text>
            <text>The State of California, the legislature dictates to them that that person must be removed, and the legislature has not a single member of the Libertarian Party there to even entertain a bill, much less to muster it.</text>

            <text>You see, that makes some difference to me.</text>

            <text>--not so much in Chaney, because at that level of detail in Chaney, I'm not sure that I would be accurate, but on the level of what is appropriate, the state does finance, in 49 states the state does finance.</text>
            <text>In South Carolina they do not.</text>
            <text>But they certainly have, and this Court has held, certain rights with regard to elections, particularly the general election in the fall.</text>
            <text>That has to do with external workings.</text>
            <text>They have a right, as has been said in this case, to orderly elections and to statutes reasonable on their face that require orderly elections.</text>
            <text>They do not have a right, and this is the profound essence of this case as far as at least my clients see it, they do not have a right to orderly parties.</text>
            <text>That is a completely different thing.</text>
            <text>And the spectrum along which we move with this case is far removed from the essence of a state saying, for example, well, you must be in a party a certain period of time before you run for election, as has been brought up several times in Anderson and other cases.</text>
            <text>This case is more like Wigoda v. Cousins and the cases where this Court held that the state may not say who will be a delegate.</text>
            <text>The state should not say who should lead parties, and I am prepared at least to suggest to the Court that this is a very dangerous idea.</text>
            <text>It is an extremely dangerous idea, and one that does not commend itself, no matter what one's party, to a comfortable feeling about how democracy would work where legislatures would dictate who would lead particular parties.</text>
            <text>Justice Harlan said in NAACP v. Alabama, he observed a nexus, a close nexus between the right of association and the right of speech, and we argue that today.</text>
            <text>We say that speech is affected by who is the speaker; who it is that will lead the party is affected.</text>
            <text>For example, the irony is, going back to the days of populism in California where the legislature, as has been historically written about, was in some ways corrupt, which party would attack that problem were they to be dictated to by the legislature itself?</text>
            <text>We are not confronted today as far as argument is concerned, and I don't think this Court is confronted with an abstract question about whether it would be all right to allow a legislature to decide something, and that is because each legislator would have interparty and intraparty conflicts, conflicts as to whether they will be running the party versus someone else, and conflicts as to whether the Libertarian Party, of which they will not be a member, by the majority in the California legislature at least, will be a strong, vibrant party.</text>
            <text>The Libertarian Party in this case was required to adopt the rules of the Peace and Freedom Party.</text>
            <text>They had to take those rules.</text>
            <text>That's all that, that's all that they could get up to this point.</text>

            <text>Mr. Brosnahan, haven't we crossed the bridge, though, when we've permitted the states to require parties to select their leaders by primary?</text>
            <text>I mean, suppose the Libertarian Party says we like the smoke-filled room.</text>
            <text>We really don't think the way... and they take a vote democratically, and 99 percent of all of their members would rather not have a primary; they would rather have the party leaders meet in a smoke-filled room; they know more about it, I don't trust my judgment as much as I do theirs.</text>
            <text>And yet, we've said, we've said the states can say to a party, you cannot pick your leaders that way; we'll tell you how to pick your leaders, your candidates.</text>
            <text>You pick them through a primary.</text>

            <label>Mr. James G. Brosnahan</label>
            <text>--I think the line is right around the poll which has to do with the state's right to see that in an earlier election party disputes are resolved.</text>
            <text>And this Court had spoken to that issue.</text>
            <text>There is, there is a right that the State has to see to it that in the general election, party disputes will have been resolved.</text>
            <text>We don't quarrel with that because it doesn't relate to the two major clusters of issues, endorsement and leadership in the party.</text>
            <text>It doesn't relate to that at all.</text>
            <text>And so we do not question the right of the state to say if you are a Republican, for example, and you have a party dispute, you should run in the primary election, and it will all be resolved, or some states have variations with conventions and alternatives and things like that.</text>

            <text>James Michael Curley, Mayor Haig, Boss Tweed, these people are gone.</text>
            <text>There are, there are powerful legislators, and that is, that is at least a footnote to this story in the sense that we believe this case presents this Court with an opportunity to write an opinion which will allow political parties in this country of whatever name, if they choose... and that's a major point that's been made... if they choose, to be open and to bring in in the neighborhoods of this country people to participate in parties.</text>
            <text>All of my clients, and there are many... I represent on the Democratic side the county committees... Justice White asked about this... the county committees that represent, in registered voters, over half of the registered Democrats in the State of California... to open up this process, as it is true in other states, so that citizens without a lot of power can be part of this process.</text>
            <text>The people in California, I think, fairly stated, would enjoy as any citizen would enjoy what is done in other states.</text>
            <text>I think of Minnesota, it's in the record, I think of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text>There are declarations by James McGregor Burns and by the mayor of Minneapolis, and they give figures to this Court as to what happens when parties are free to structure themselves the way they want.</text>
            <text>The State of Massachusetts, sometimes, there are over hundreds of thousands of citizens who participate in the party.</text>
            <text>It is not dictated from a capital.</text>
            <text>It is not, it is not the question of dominance.</text>
            <text>The standard is compelling interest.</text>
            <text>The state has great trouble in articulating that, that standard, or to give this Court a basis on which to treat, as you are required to do in many other cases, the serious concerns articulated, and there's been five years of litigation.</text>

            <text>Two years certainly is very short and cuts right into the accumulated experience and leadership qualities that one might possess.</text>
            <text>In fact, one of these parties changed its term, and I don't know about ten years.</text>
            <text>You could come to a point, I suppose, where the state would make a greater interest.</text>
            <text>But I have not, I have not heard, nor have I read a strong compelling interest based on general elections, based on that justification, for the limitation of the term.</text>
            <text>Why does the state need to tell the Libertarian Party you will have a leader for two years, and at the end of that two years, no matter what you have accomplished, no matter what you have done, you will be out.</text>
            <text>Surely I think I sense that we are at the very heart of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>One reads in the decisions of this Court the scholarly musings of Professor Emerson or Meiklejohn or any of these great scholars about what's involved.</text>

            <text>That is referred to in People v. Crutcher, and it is also reflected in Section 15 of the Elections Code which tracks the language in 29102.</text>

            <text>What is the sanction, then, against, against the county committees violating the prohibition of endorsement?</text>

            <text>This... these statutes are designed to protect the First Amendment rights of the members of the political parties.</text>

            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>The... another point that we'd like to make is that although the provision for the bar on endorsements did not show up in statute until 1963, it is well documented and undisputed that this has been the longstanding policy of the major parties in California all the way through to the present time, and there is really nothing substantial in the record to indicate that that is not the case to this day.</text>
            <text>The state does have an overriding compelling interest, I believe, if Justice White was referring to the Storer case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill</label>
            <text>It was a compelling interest standard, and California was found to have met that standard in Storer, to protect the integrity of the parties in the primary system and in the general election system.</text>
