            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="18.072" offset="213538">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.364" offset="226704">These appeals are about New Jersey's novel attempt to raise its own state tax revenues at the expense of only out-of-state economic interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.832" offset="268605">Most of the paths to that tempting goal have been shut off over the years by this Court's decisions which have made it crystal clear that while interstate business must bear its fair share of local tax burdens, it must be made to bear no more than its fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.282" offset="334433">But New Jersey seems to feel it has found a loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.445" offset="347076">Under the formula apportionment method of taxation, a state first determines the total income from the entire enterprise from sources both inside and outside the state and then takes a slice of that income for itself by using a fair apportionment formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.975" offset="409143">The Court's decisions have insisted that the formula be geographically neutral so that the state does not impute to itself a greater portion of total net income than can be reasonably attributed to the company's activities within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.943" offset="465045">What New Jersey has done is used a perfectly reasonable apportionment formula, but it has applied it to a geographically skewed base.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.470" offset="495138">It has not skewed the base by adding out-of-state revenues to it in an inappropriate way or overstating out-of-state revenues; what it has done is found a cost that is incurred only outside the state, only by crude oil producers, and has disallowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.900" offset="552921">The result of that has been to drastically raise the income that New Jersey taxes from the oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.122" offset="581760">And the question that is raised, in our view, by this is whether a state can sidestep the usual apportionment mechanisms on the theory that income tax deductions are purely a matter of legislative grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.940" offset="629094">I'd like, if I may, to start with describing a little bit of the context in which this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.635" offset="655844">The Appellants are all integrated interstate petroleum companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.449" offset="679040">They do business in New Jersey, but they produce crude oil only outside New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.083" offset="693565">There is no crude oil produced at all in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.413" offset="702969">During the years at issue each of the companies incurred very substantial windfall profit tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.847" offset="728673">That tax operates much as a severance tax does: it is imposed on the removal of each barrel of crude oil from the producing premises, and it is measured by a portion of the barrel's wellhead value.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.225" offset="774231">Under New Jersey's formula apportionment method, it requires the Appellants to include in their preapportionment base all of their income from all sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.892" offset="812892">That means that the base includes the income from, derived from the production activities outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.654" offset="839850">At the same time, New Jersey law, as construed by the state Supreme Court, disallows a deduction for these billions of dollars of windfall profit taxes that Appellants incurred solely in the course of those out-of-state production activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.110" offset="933682">No, we do not, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.632" offset="939847">The distinction, as I hope to develop a little bit further in a moment, is that the activities that give rise to the federal income tax liability are activities that take place everywhere, including New Jersey, and as a consequence, the cost of federal income taxes is not site-specific and geographically localized to any specific activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.312" offset="2894538">The Solicitor General's position... I'm going to be careful not to overstate it because the Solicitor General did not reach a bottom line conclusion with respect to the correctness or incorrectness of the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision, but the Solicitor General did set up a framework for analysis which we think is very much consistent with our own view of the case, and he had no trouble with what I think is the starting point for the analysis, which is whether this windfall profit tax is or isn't a site-specific cost of oil production.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.933" offset="3017000">He agreed that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.994" offset="3025254">He didn't think that was a hard question.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.874" offset="3032778">He thought that the real question in the case, the dispositive one, was whether the windfall profit tax was more like a severance tax or more like an income tax, on the theory that if it was more like an income tax, there were similar in-state outlays that were being disallowed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.867" offset="3100800">The state operates this disallowance under what it calls its... what the state Supreme Court referred to as an add-back provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.540" offset="3127445">Like most states, New Jersey starts with a federal taxable income as the starting point for computing local taxation, and then it makes adjustments up and down, and one of them is an add-back which provides that the taxpayers must add back taxes paid or accrued to the United States on or measured by profits or income.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.884" offset="3212814">The issue, statutory issue in the court below was is this that kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.026" offset="3233398">The court ultimately held it was, although it recognized, and recognized that the base on which the windfall profit tax is assessed is quite different from the base on which the federal income taxes is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.376" offset="3286792">In fact, it specifically said something that the state's brief on the merits at least quite clearly repudiates, that the tax, windfall profit tax is imposed on production at the wellhead and is based on values measured at the time of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.907" offset="3352934">So the states, the state court ultimately concluded that for statutory interpretation purposes this was a tax of the sort described in that add-back provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.666" offset="3395984">What is significant, though, is that this is the only tax affected by that add-back provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.668" offset="3423987">There's no reason, there's no necessity for adding back federal income taxes because they're not deducted in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.001" offset="3445303">So the adjustment, although the provision has been read for purposes of, I suppose, comfort by the tax administrator in New Jersey as being confirmation that the federal income tax is not in fact deductible by taxpayers in New Jersey, nothing has to be done mechanically the way the statute is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.494" offset="3519282">This is the only tax that is in fact covered by the add-back provision in a practical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.117" offset="3541747">It is also the only tax in the category of taxes on profits or income within the New Jersey designation that is in fact based on transaction oriented tax liability rather than tax liability incurred on account of transactions throughout the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.102" offset="5597689">So if you accept the premise; that the deduction of the windfall profit tax is a proper thing, what New Jersey has done is to tax Amerada Hess on twice of its total... twice its total income nationwide.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.145" offset="5805832">Let me answer that this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.825" offset="5812624">I think in a way that New York presents that issue because New York's level of production is really quite, quite small, and I'm not prepared to stand here and say that our principle will not reach New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.244" offset="5854211">I thin it probably does reach New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.274" offset="5862361">But I think one could draw the line at New Jersey if one chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.888" offset="5884827">I don't think it would really hold up to scrutiny but the difference is that in New Jersey, every single taxpayer who is affected by this disallowance has his base dramatically skewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.544" offset="5923488">There may be in a state like New York or Pennsylvania or Michigan, as the state suggests, there may be substantial enough production that some producers are entirely in-state producers, and as to them, maybe the skewing doesn't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.023" offset="5981375">Maybe they have more in-state costs that are disallowed than out-of-state costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.935" offset="5992974">Maybe that's a basis for drawing the line right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.489" offset="6003214">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.468" offset="6007184">I don't think it is, probably, and I've thought about that a great deal, and I'm not comfortable with a line that I can defend at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.293" offset="6034456">That's why I think a better approach is to assure oneself that the impact of a disallowance does have some significant effect on the in-state economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.309" offset="6078551">If it has that, then there's some protection, some reason to hope at least that the political forces will operate in a way to make sure these kinds of things don't happen the way they have here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary R. Hamill</label>
            <text syncTime="1567.220" offset="6410201">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.934" offset="6509049">I'd really like to make just two points on behalf of New Jersey today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.828" offset="6524618">The first is that New Jersey is not discriminating against interstate commerce nor skewing the income base of the corporation tax by denying a deduction for the windfall profit tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.146" offset="6565891">All New Jersey is doing is applying a longstanding statutory provision which denies a deduction for all federal income or profits-based taxes, regardless of where the taxed activity takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.915" offset="6624928">And I think the Chief Justice picked up on this point in his first question to Mr. Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.847" offset="6652722">We deny a deduction for all federal income-based taxes, and the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that this was an income-based tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.224" offset="6690129">The second point I'd like to make is that the company's proposed constitutional rule would be difficult to apply, as I think Justice Scalia pointed out, and would severely restrict the state's ability to define net income, and the Court has made clear that there is a very large leeway that the states have in defining net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.228" offset="6770169">The case where the Court indicated that was Atlantic Coastline Railway v. Daughton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.760" offset="6792320">To to back now to my point that all we're doing is applying a longstanding statutory provision, since 1958 New Jersey has had a corporate franchise tax measured by income that taxes unitary net income apportioned to New Jersey, and included in that unitary net income, as this Court has held is permissible, is income attributable to the production of crude oil in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.350" offset="6902662">Since 1958, more than 20 years before the enactment of the windfall profit tax, New Jersey has had a statutory provision that denies a deduction for taxes paid or accrued to the United States on or measured by profits or income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.510" offset="6971312">That provision applies to all federal income or profits-based taxes, including the federal income tax, the federal minimum tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.037" offset="7017392">It would apply to federal excess profits taxes, and we believe it applies to the windfall profit tax, and the New Jersey Supreme Court so held because it concluded that the windfall profit tax is an income-based tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.557" offset="7127524">Or perhaps I should ask the question, do you think New Jersey could constitutionally treat severance taxes imposed by states in the same way it has treated this tax?</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.318" offset="7250508">One, is there a constitutional objection to treating severance taxes the way New Jersey treats this tax, and if so, could you overcome the objection by just calling it an income tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.265" offset="7294394">Because arguably, what you have... what we have before us is something that at least the Solicitor General suggests could be treated as a site-specific tax and therefore comparable to a severance tax, even though in construing your statute your Court has called it an income tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.773" offset="7352386">--Well, I think New Jersey could deny a deduction for severance taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.478" offset="7379240">It in fact does not because it follows the federal income tax treatment of severance taxes, and they are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.763" offset="7412363">New Jersey has no severance tax, so that even if the windfall profit tax, under the Solicitor General's theory, is akin to a severance tax, I don't see the in-state favoritism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.934" offset="7473072">How can there be any favoritism if we don't have that tax?</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.356" offset="7546737">If you had a severance tax, it wouldn't be a problem because then you'd be affecting yourself, you'd be denying deductions to people in your state as well as deductions to people elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.353" offset="7590727">It precisely becomes a problem when you do not allow a deduction for severance tax which is cost free to you because you don't have any severance taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.115" offset="8989741">Well, I think in conceptually, theoretically, one could possibly do that, but in fact the problem is that the Court has held that gross receipts may be taxed by the state where the receipt is realized, so that if you had that taxing scheme that's fairly well accepted, and then some states started to apportion gross receipts, you might very well have double taxation of those receipts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.506" offset="10231289">The price may vary from the Gulf coast to the east coast to the west coast, and then they net back from that figure to reach the wellhead price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.884" offset="10272771">But since they start with a figure that's in the lower 48 states, and for Exxon that figure is the value of the oil for Exxon's oil sent to the east coast, it's the value of that oil at Exxon's refinery in Linden, New Jersey, I don't see how that can be called a site-specific cost when that's the basis for the computation of the windfall profit tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="2996.827" offset="12128614">Just a couple of things I'd like to, I'd like to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.930" offset="12157036">First of all, we agree that the Constitution does not prescribe any set of tax deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.685" offset="12183994">It does not say which particular ones must be granted or may be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.520" offset="12211370">It may even be that a state could disallow all deductions, tax gross receipts or gross income on some kind of apportionment mechanism, for purposes of our argument, although I should say that the Solicitor General has a footnote in his brief in which he expresses some reservation about whether the theory of apportionment really applies to gross rather than net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.562" offset="12291514">But in any event, the key there is that if that was what a state decided to do, it would burden everybody equally, out-of-staters and in-staters would suffer the same tax consequences and we would not have the kind of skewing problem that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.422" offset="12342923">I think one thing I did not mention earlier but I think is a counterpoint, Justice Scalia, to the concerns that we discussed earlier about where to draw the line, if you decide that no line is to be drawn, what it does is it opens up to the states an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.033" offset="12409378">There's just no way to stop a state once it's been told it can find and burden purely out-of-state costs from just spending a good deal of their tax energies looking for such things because they are just natural targets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.039" offset="12457444">Now, there aren't any that happen right now, but there are even in New Jersey some things that you can't find everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.743" offset="12480223">There are casinos in New Jersey, and in fact, there's a casino control tax imposed on casinos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.738" offset="12500285">There are ports in New Jersey, and there's a federal harbor use tax that's based on the value of the cargo loaded or unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.592" offset="12523690">Well, if New Jersey can do this to Louisiana or Texas producers, Louisiana or... Texas is not a good example, but Louisiana or Oklahoma legislatures can just start disallowing from any unitary business that is affected by ports or by casinos, the deduction for those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.833" offset="12592654">So it just opens up exactly the kind of succession of retaliatory measures that the commerce clause was designed to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.366" offset="12614701">Maybe if they had a general tax, a general disallowance of deduction that happened to embrace casino taxes it would be okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.726" offset="12672170">--Justice Scalia, the same thing could happen in Louisiana and Oklahoma that happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.109" offset="12693695">You could look at a general disallowance, call it an add-back or whatever, that deals with income taxes or something similar, or gift taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.376" offset="12730789">As one of our amici says, you could call it a gift tax for purposes of statutory interpretation; it makes no constitutional difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.008" offset="12753359">But the administrator could simply construe income taxes to embrace value-based excise taxes, which is essentially what New Jersey has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.354" offset="12786691">I'd like to just get back to one of the... what I think is ultimately one of the key questions here, which is whether this is or isn't like a severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.761" offset="12828278">Well, this Court has done some work on severance taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.923" offset="12841026">In Commonwealth Edison it discussed a coal severance tax in Montana, and the guidance from that decision is that there are two things to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.041" offset="12881463">You look at the operating incidence of the tax... in this case it's the removal of each barrel of crude oil... and you look at the measure... in this case it's wellhead values... identical in significant, in all significant respects to the kind of tax that was at issue in Commonwealth Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.041" offset="12941440">And what the Court found there was that only Montana could tax that event and that measure because it is purely site-specific to Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.835" offset="12976654">And I think the same principle applies here.</text>
