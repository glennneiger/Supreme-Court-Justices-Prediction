            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135853">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1956, Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General v. The Minnesota Newspaper Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="179216">Mr. Larkin?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="12.308" stopTime="140.491">
            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="185068">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.426" offset="201473">At issue in this case is the facial constitutionality under the First Amendment of a provision of the Anti-Lottery Act of 1890, an act of Congress that has been on the books for 99 years, and it has already been upheld by this Court over a First Amendment challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.186" offset="264584">The Anti-Lottery Act of 1890 contains two clauses that are relevant here: an advertisement clause and a prize list clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.041" offset="295931">The advertisement clause prohibits sending advertisements through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.577" offset="310142">The prize list clause prohibits sending through the mail lists of prizes drawn or awarded by the lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="336055">Now, this case, however, is now smaller in scope than it was when the Court noted probable jurisdiction in October and when we filed our brief in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.520" offset="369910">The district court upheld the constitutionality of the advertisement clause, but that ruling is no longer before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.674" offset="394465">What is before the Court is the district court's ruling on the constitutionality of the prize list clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.811" offset="415050">The district court held that clause unconstitutional on its face on the ground that it was designed to and would prevent a distribution through the mails of news stories that contained lists of prizes awarded by a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.154" offset="468444">What remains in this case in our view still presents a live controversy between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.356" offset="489237">That controversy can be decided on the record as it now stands, and that controversy can be resolved in our favor essentially by relying on this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.728" offset="526749">The judgment below should be reversed for two reasons which I will summarize.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.366" offset="541273">First, the district court misread the scope of the prize list clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.168" offset="560500">This Court in the Horner case held that a prize list used in the commercial promotion of a lottery fit within the term "prize list" in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="598638">In our view that is also as far as the statute reaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.910" offset="611491">In other words, the prize list clause does not apply to news stories, editorials or similar types of commentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.564" offset="638031">It applies only to what today would be called commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.199" offset="652555">Second, when the prize list clause is construed in that manner, it is facially constitutional under this Court's decisions in Ex parte Jackson, In re Rapler and Posadas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="140.491" stopTime="147.561">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="140.491" offset="697799">Well, if you exclude news stories and editorials, what kind of a... what have you got left?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="147.561" stopTime="212.170">
            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="147.561" offset="726011">What you have left, Your Honor, is the type of prize list that this Court addressed in the Horner case, and that shows up in some of the examples we've reprinted in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.154" offset="776375">In the appendix to our opening brief, we've reprinted several examples of what were prize lists that were distributed during the period before this Act became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.593" offset="822142">If you look to page 11a to 12a, you'll see an advertisement that was distributed in behalf of the Louisiana Lottery, which was the most famous or infamous lottery in the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.353" offset="881179">If you look to the top of page 12a, you will see a section entitled "List of Prizes".</text>
            <text syncTime="194.126" offset="912317">At page 14a in the appendix is another prize list, this one distributed on behalf of the Kentucky lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.064" offset="952023">Now, those examples we think are important because that is what this Court construed the Act to cover in the Horner case.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.757" offset="1010851">They could be put... put out by lotteries by purchasing advertising space or space for the promotion of a prize list in a newspaper.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.003" offset="1103846">But if you buy space in the newspaper to publish your prize list, isn't that an ad?</text>

            <text syncTime="245.205" offset="1116594">--Not necessarily, no, because Congress adopted two different clauses in the statute because I think it saw that there were two different types of promotional materials being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.013" offset="1159853">The types of promotional materials you see here that would constitute a prize list is the same type of promotional material the Court addressed in the Horner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.321" offset="1205097">We have reprinted in our brief at page 30, footnote 27, what this Court addressed in the Horner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.844" offset="1235190">The prize list that is reprinted at that part of our brief is the same as the ones here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.212" offset="1256611">What was happening in the 19th century was that you had two different types basically of promotional materials being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.567" offset="1286077">You had an advertisement that didn't include the lists of what could be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.555" offset="1306034">That, for example, is at page 13a of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.090" offset="1324111">And then you had other types of promotional materials that basically just consisted of a list of what the lottery would award.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.216" offset="1588679">And then you had other types of promotional materials that told them the prizes you could actually win if you entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.928" offset="1667464">For example, at the time some lotteries in the 19th century actually tried to take advantage of the loophole in the 1876 Act by publishing their own lottery newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.651" offset="1714380">For example, the postal... the Postmaster General pointed that out to Congress when they were considering this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.841" offset="1743115">So, in that case what you could have is the, say, Kentucky Lottery newspaper that was being printed, and you could have reprinted as the same way you have advertisements at grocery stores nowadays an advertisement about the lottery or list of the prizes that the lottery was going to award.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.367" offset="1805286">You also could have the situation in which even if it wasn't a newspaper that was sponsored by the lottery itself, the... the lottery could purchase space in the newspaper to reprint the advertisement or the prize list.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.991" offset="1859726">Let me explain some of the background to this, and it may help answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.978" offset="1875713">In the 19th century, gambling, particularly lotteries, were treated with the same contempt that narcotics trafficking is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.132" offset="1904343">That's clear not only from the materials that were before Congress, the statements by Presidents of the United States, but from the decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.859" offset="2183226">It engaged in business on a nationwide scale by putting advertisements and other types of promotional materials in newspapers, and the reason it put those materials in newspapers is that the existing 1876 law that this Court upheld in the Jackson case did not apply to newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.663" offset="2310495">It decided that the only way effectively to do so was to deny the Louisiana Lottery access to its primary source of income which was money from out-of-state bettors since the Louisiana Lottery received more than 90 percent of its income from out-of-state bettors.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.673" offset="2370472">The result of that was the Anti-Lottery Act of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.125" offset="2384264">Congress passed that law in order to deny the Louisiana Lottery the opportunity to use newspapers for... for promoting their own financial success.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.600" offset="2426165">It was that type of prize list or that type of advertisement that Congress was concerned about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.881" offset="8479363">And incidentally, on February 21, I contacted the Deputy Solicitor General, after we had gotten deeply into the briefing process, and suggested a joint motion to this Court based on what was then the agreed construction of this statute to ask the Court to dismiss this case, vacate the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.378" offset="8557313">So, we... we felt, at least a month ago, that... that this was the result that was certainly acceptable to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.090" offset="8624186">In that case, the Court will recall the National Labor Relations Board had applied the jurisdiction under the NLRA to some mixed religious and secular schools in the... in the Archdiocese of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.064" offset="8680088">That was appealed by the... by the Archbishop, and it went to the Seventh Circuit which held that application facially unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.705" offset="8718645">That was, in turn, appealed by the board to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.590" offset="8734109">And this Court determined that under the... going back to Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion in Murray v.

            <text syncTime="2171.071" offset="8820104">If that could be avoided by construction, the Court should do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.356" offset="8829195">In Catholic Bishop, the Court announced a version of that rule which I think is a little more precise and objective than earlier versions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.478" offset="8869737">What it said was that a two-step test should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.282" offset="8884888">Number one... this was a narrow question... if the application of the statute... too in this case it was the religious activity, another clause of the First Amendment... was such as to raise this kind of sensitive constitutional issue, then you went to the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.875" offset="8943298">You went to Congress and you went to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.275" offset="8952911">You went to the legislative history and you found out if, in fact, it was a clearly expressed intention of Congress to apply the broad language of the... in this case the jurisdiction clause of the act... to this kind of sensitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.254" offset="9012784">And if you didn't find that, absent that, then it was to be construed not to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.621" offset="9030233">Now, the same... the Court was divided in Catholic Bishop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.442" offset="9053535">The Court really joined last year in DeBartolo v. Florida Building Trades and applied what it called the traditional rule of Catholic Bishop in a similar situation dealing directly with speech in a peaceful hand-billing situation in a Florida shopping mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.119" offset="9108287">I think it's terribly important that what those cases hold applies here in that a careful reading, Justice Scalia, of the... not just the... the Anti-Lottery Act of 1890, but the many pages of text of the House report, and all of the reports in the history, you simply find no expression on the part of the sponsors of the bill to apply this to news and editorial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.441" offset="10521616">I think it was Justice O'Connor asked about the scope of the relief they asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.528" offset="10541887">The scope of the relief they asked for in district court was not limited to advertisements and news stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.599" offset="10562158">Page 8 of the joint appendix reprints their request, and they ask the statute to be held void to the extent they prohibit or interfere with the publication of information about lawful gaming activities regardless of the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.157" offset="10612418">So, they asked for the statute to be held invalid insofar as it prevented them from publishing any information about lawful gaming activities, not just advertisements and not just news stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.714" offset="10654632">Secondly, I don't think it is we that have changed our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.683" offset="10674485">After all, the Appellee filed a motion to affirm in which it asked this Court summarily to affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.670" offset="10698517">Appellee has now said that it doesn't mind if the case is affirmed, reversed, vacated or disposed of in some other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.507" offset="10725789">But our construction of the statute has been consistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.876" offset="10739269">We asked the district court not to read the statute to apply to news stories.</text>
