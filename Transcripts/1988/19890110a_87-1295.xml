            <text syncTime="13.921" offset="190811">This case stems from the detention of Respondent outside the Honolulu airport on the ground that he was suspected of narcotics trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.055" offset="223411">The question presented by this case involves the type of evidence on which a law enforcement officer may rely in making that type of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.739" offset="254131">It's our submission that the reasonable suspicion inquiry in this context should be answered in the same way that that question is answered in any other context, by looking to the totality of the circumstances, viewing the facts in a common sense manner, and giving weight to the reasonable inferences that a trained and experienced law enforcement officer can draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.642" offset="325707">Respondent was detained just as he was about to board a cab outside the Honolulu airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.316" offset="352456">At that time the agents knew the following: They knew that Respondent had purchased two round trip open return tickets from Honolulu to Miami for $2,100 by handing the airline ticket agent a $4,000 roll of $20 bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.758" offset="418180">The agents knew that Respondent had just spent 20 hours flying 12,000 miles to spend only two days at his destination, which happens to be the nation's principal source city for cocaine.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="166.463" offset="801031">At the time the Respondent was stopped, the agents also had reason to suspect that he was traveling under an alias because there was a discrepancy between the name that he gave to the airline and the name listed for the telephone number at which Respondent's voice was on an answering machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.851" offset="858605">The agents also knew the Respondent appeared nervous when he first purchased his tickets in Honolulu, and that he appeared nervous and was looking all around the waiting area in the L.A. airport awaiting a connecting flight back.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.588" offset="905521">The agents also knew the Respondent had purchased his tickets shortly before his departure from Honolulu and that he and his companion had checked none of their four bags for either leg of their journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.505" offset="949198">From all of those facts, a trained and experienced law enforcement officer could draw the following four inferences.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.490" offset="981171">Do you have to be a trained and experienced law enforcement officer to draw those inferences?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="215.554" offset="997367">I think it certainly helps because it cuts down on the time necessary for someone to go through the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.289" offset="1024326">We, for example, in our brief have explained in detail why each of these factors is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.660" offset="1041775">A law enforcement officer with the type of experience that these people had doesn't need to write that out or go through the detail that we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.946" offset="1070928">You can easily, if you have the experience that these people have, make that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.148" offset="1083780">Now, if you were a new law enforcement officer and had been trained by other people who are experienced to look for these certain factors, then a new law enforcement officer making a common sense judgment in a case like this where the evidence is this strong, I think, could easily reach the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.938" offset="1146892">So, the difference is really, I guess, just a matter of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.771" offset="1162252">It's intuitive for someone with the type of experience that these law enforcement officers had.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.833" offset="1182523">But for someone who may be new, I think he would certainly come to the same conclusion, but he may just have to think about it a little.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.500" offset="2609122">One is that it could have been wrong and another is that each of the facts on which the agents relied could have an innocent explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.166" offset="2635872">Both of those arguments, in our view, are foreclosed by well settled case law in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.309" offset="2656456">It's well settled in cases such as Cortez and Gates that all the facts must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.083" offset="2679549">And that is, in fact, what the DEA agent, Agent Kempshall, did in this case, as he testified at pages 59 to 61 of the suppression hearing transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.875" offset="2710686">He considered all of the facts because he said there may be an innocent explanation for each fact when each fact on a trip is considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.942" offset="2738899">It's also settled law that an agent need not conclusively prove that a person is in possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.275" offset="2768260">Terry only requires that a rational, objectively based inference be used to support an intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.980" offset="2795114">Now, the Court of Appeals disagreed with us both as to the bottom line and as to the reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.404" offset="2824789">According to the Court of Appeals, the central flaw in our position was that the government had, and I'm quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="678.719" offset="2850076">"unwittingly equated evidence of behavior that a criminal may engage in with behavior indicating an ongoing crime. "</text>
            <text syncTime="684.722" offset="2874109">To remedy that type of error the Court of Appeals created a new reasonable suspicion test.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.386" offset="2896678">It consists of two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.649" offset="2905769">The first category of evidence consists of evidence of what the Court of Appeals believes was an ongoing crime, such as the use of an alias.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.182" offset="2931891">The second category which the Court of Appeals termed probabilistic evidence consists of conduct that a drug courier may engage in, such as the cash purchase of airline tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.799" offset="2970344">The Court of Appeals then set up a mechanism for analyzing the evidence once it's fit into one of these two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.553" offset="2993331">To establish reasonable suspicion, the government must prove at least one factor from the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.677" offset="3017886">Factors from the second category only serve to confirm or refute the presence of reasonable suspicion based on evidence from the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.000" offset="3051219">But even to serve that limited confirmatory function, the government must first show that the factors on which it relies have statistical or empirical validity in that they describe only someone who is presently engaged in criminal activity and not someone who is merely a criminal or who is innocent of any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.424" offset="3124884">Otherwise, all the factors that fit into category two, such as the ones I mentioned before, are in the Court of Appeals' terms irrelevant to the suspicion analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.961" offset="3163023">The Ninth Circuit applied that test in this case in a very mechanical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.544" offset="3185384">It said that there was no evidence that Respondent was using an alias.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.028" offset="3203251">It then went on to say there was no evidence that Respondent's nervousness was due to fear of apprehension rather than fear of a mid-air collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.293" offset="3236375">At that point it stopped its analysis entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.535" offset="3249331">It didn't consider any of the remaining evidence even though in its first opinion it said the cash purchase alone was close to establishing reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.001" offset="3283186">Now, no decision by this Court remotely suggests that the facts should be pigeonholed into two categories in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.816" offset="3310458">The Cortez case and the Gates case to us seem to make clear that all of the facts must be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.705" offset="4713965">In fact, what's ironic about the Ninth Circuit's test is that if the Ninth Circuit was responding to what it believed was a drug courier profile, then the Ninth Circuit's opinion created its own drug courier profile in an attempt to respond.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.400" offset="5396806">My first address... the issue of the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.425" offset="5424913">The Solicitor General has suggested that Ninth Circuit did not use the Gates test or the totality of the circumstances in looking at the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.222" offset="5468068">In fact, in looking at the Ninth Circuit opinion, it did state specifically just as Officer Kempshall did at the Honolulu International Airport, he considered the total picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.949" offset="5514984">He considered the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.271" offset="5528254">In coming to that... in looking at the totality of the circumstances, he looked at each element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.005" offset="5551242">And in looking at each element, gave it whatever weight or value he thought was appropriate, just like what the Ninth Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.400" offset="5576737">The Ninth Circuit went one more step further in looking at these elements is that they looked at elements that were... that covered almost any innocent traveler and then they looked at those few elements that possibly showed criminal activity being afoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.953" offset="5642984">And they found that in the cases... in prior cases before this Court such criminal activity was use of an alias or possibly walking through an airport in such a manner as to try to hide their identity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.707" offset="5802017">I find... and let me go one step in, in just responding to the questions put to Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.794" offset="5834304">Not everyone in this country are lucky enough to be able to have a credit card, and other of us maybe are afraid to have a credit card because maybe we don't know how to control ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.752" offset="5890206">There's no gambling in Honolulu, in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.904" offset="5906820">My mother lives in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.356" offset="5920613">On the flight over I was with another attorney whose mother was in Florida and he was going to visit her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.490" offset="5937122">They have racetracks in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.222" offset="5948094">If you don't have a credit card, and if I was flying to... whenever I fly to Florida to visit my family, you know how... it would be difficult to cash a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.789" offset="5990308">I do take a lot of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.470" offset="5997100">And hundred dollar bills are often difficult to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.330" offset="6012460">Most places do not take them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.222" offset="6020087">You have to go into a bank and get change for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.754" offset="6030223">In the hindsight, which is exactly what the government used in looking at these factors, we can come up with numerous purposes and reasons why an individual may carry a relatively small amount of cash, $4,000, when you consider the tickets were $2,100, especially if they intend to gamble, and people in Hawaii do enjoy gambling.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.771" offset="11042285">When the agents talked about the West Coast, what he said was that narcotics are transported from Miami to the West Coast for transshipment then to Hawaii, for example, or for use on the West Coast itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.082" offset="11099545">For a long time narcotics in L.A. came from Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.085" offset="11119503">I'm told that recently and unfortunately there is now narcotics coming in from Mexico as well.</text>
