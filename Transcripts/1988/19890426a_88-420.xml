            <text syncTime="1246.952" offset="5116129">The, as the opinion below notes, that's due to just the whim of the 15 year term running first is because, is because it was the first count in the charging document.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.600" offset="5702735">I think one thing that has been completely overlooked in this case so far is the effect of a governor's commutation of a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.077" offset="5740664">When the Governor commuted the man's sentence, then the legal position in Missouri and in, I think, the universal law, accord..., at least according to American jurisprudence, is that the man's legal position is the same as if he had been originally sentenced to that length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.980" offset="5824256">Now this Court, in Whalen v. the United States, held that, uh, where there is a felony murder the underlying felony is a lesser-included defense, and unless the legislative body had decided there should be multiple punishment, there should not be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.043" offset="5904504">It was one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.713" offset="5911192">And this man committed one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.267" offset="5925402">They call it first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.469" offset="5938255">But it is the codification of the old felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.683" offset="5955077">He received the robbery sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.775" offset="5975453">He apparently was a very good boy in prison and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.850" offset="5995724">We are not informed as to why the Governor commuted his sentence, but I know from the motions I had to file to get that writ of habeas corpus that he had completed his high school equivalency, had completed, uh, two years of college with grades of A and B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.946" offset="6076181">Uh, and he is now living with his sister, the school teacher, and is now employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.759" offset="6103349">Uh, my opponent said there would be no problem if he had only been sentenced to life imprisonment first and not the 15 year sec... not the 15 years first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.210" offset="6169177">That, I submit, is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.263" offset="6181402">Because no matter which he had been sentenced to first, when the Governor commutes one of them, he has served one complete, legitimate sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.880" offset="8799917">If it is true, and I believe it is, that the founding fathers put the first ten amendments in the Constitution to restrain the power of courts and I respectfully submit you should be restrained and affirm the judgment of the 8th Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.760" offset="8919453">If the Governor of Missouri wanted to commute this man's sentence, he gave him a present, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.045" offset="8948501">He may not have realized he was giving him a present, but he gave him one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.617" offset="8966787">And now you are asked to reach back in time and make the position of the prisoner more onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.581" offset="8998656">Now my opponent says, I say that's a ex post facto type judgment, which is forbidden by the due process clause according to your case of Boule v. City of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.322" offset="9053618">My opponent says that point was not raised originally and cannot now be raised because it's a matter of procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.079" offset="9092697">I say that since the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was for the prisoner, that I can cite that as a reason to support that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.640" offset="9150898">I don't think you have to cross-appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.884" offset="9159884">I don't think you have to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.054" offset="9168557">Uh, I mean, just to be absurd, if, uh, it was proposed that you engage in 104 constitutional violations, uh, and I argued, uh, oh, that's all right because it wasn't raised in the court below, that's pretty silly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.776" offset="9239505">Uh, and here it is proposed that you enter an ex post facto judgment which you have said violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.975" offset="9284227">And, uh, I might point out, of course, that the various United States Courts of Appeals have followed these cases of Ex parte Lange, In re Bradley, United States versus Benz, and we have their cases that are right in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.868" offset="9371789">And you are just going to upset the whole thing if you reverse the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.263" offset="9397389">Uh, besides, you are going to really be holding the Missouri Governor's power to commute sentences for nought, because that's going to be taken away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.221" offset="9445246">He no longer has that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.864" offset="9451829">He no longer can say, I served that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.327" offset="9473667">No doubt taking that away from him makes his situation more onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.334" offset="9513686">Uh, you pointed out in Weaver versus Graham that when Florida enacted a statute that took away good time, it was an ex post fact statute as far as those prisoners who had earned good time under that, and made their condition more onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.027" offset="9600517">And you held it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.581" offset="9618699">You, uh, had somewhat the same, uh, situation, well, not really, but you had an ex post facto judgment in that Boule versus the City of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.481" offset="9694245">There two blacks went into a drugstore, sat at a counter where they, or sat in a booth, where they might be served food.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.592" offset="9754744">And they didn't actually refer, uh, refuse to serve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.177" offset="9781076">What they actually did was they asked them to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.561" offset="9790584">The statute said that, uh, if you enter upon a landowner's property without his consent where you have received notice that you shall not enter, then that's some kind of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.940" offset="9864145">And the South Carolina court interpreted this statute to add this additional business which wasn't in it, that if you are asked to leave, you violated that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.061" offset="9920570">And they, you're, this Court said that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.355" offset="9941781">That's an ex post facto judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.126" offset="9952857">And that's that you're doing when you take this commuted sentence away and say it's of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.901" offset="9979920">The simple thing is that once in a while, under the Constitution, things happen that courts don't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.966" offset="10012207">And I think that there is where you have to decide you'll be restrained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.424" offset="10126101">One of the last comments that were made by the respondent was, sometimes the federal Constitution requires courts to do things that the courts don't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.630" offset="10162882">If that's the situation, then perhaps there is a fundamental flaw in what the court is thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.233" offset="10185242">The example here is with multiple punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.547" offset="10202588">The multiple punishment concept of the double jeopardy clause only prohibits multiple punishment that it, or not, or only prohibits punishment that is not authorized by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.125" offset="10248877">The, the, the application of Bradley to this situation is what creates the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.271" offset="10285448">It's what created the result of the, of the five judges from the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.986" offset="10304256">When you look at Bradley, and when you look at it and, and think that the rule announced in Bradley, that completion of service of alternative sentences precludes the power of the court to punish further, that language, the holding in Bradley, which is dicta from Lange, had no support before Bradley, and has not been followed by this Court since Bradley.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.553" offset="10618562">That was his subjective expectation when the sentencing judge announced his intent in sentencing, or announced his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.665" offset="10643012">Do you want to look at some objective in expectation of the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.549" offset="10662552">The defendant's objective expectation at the time of sentencing was that he would either serve 15 years for the attempted robbery conviction or that he would serve a life term for the murder connected with the attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.990" offset="10724305">Now, if you look at that objective expectation that the defendant may have, that's what's been fulfilled here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.904" offset="10979992">Well, I think maybe you have to look at more than just his expectations plus the legislature's intent as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.778" offset="10999427">Suppose the sentencing judge says, i'm going to give you eight years right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.160" offset="11013011">I'm really not sure that's going to be enough for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.751" offset="11023355">I'll think some more about it, and I may impose, may impose a further sentence down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.096" offset="11044775">Do you think that would, uh, be sustainable under the double jeopardy clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.898" offset="11064002">Well, it tests whether his expectations are what govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.161" offset="11076958">I mean, when you're talking about the double jeopardy clause, you're talking about a very technical provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.025" offset="11092423">I mean the fact that it has some fluky consequences doesn't surprise me any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.895" offset="11107992">It, it is in its nature a technicality.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen D. Hawke</label>
            <text syncTime="2748.159" offset="11120949">And in response to that, I do not believe that the Court should, should examine the, uh, the case under the double jeopardy clause in a technical manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.675" offset="11167029">The Court should look at the purposes behind the double jeopardy clause, uh, in this case be it examining the, uh, making sure the punishment is not exceeding the, uh, the legislature's intent, and perhaps some expectancy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.845" offset="11219691">I don't think you have to get into any type of expectancy interest in this case, because other under either a subjective or objective, uh, interest in the defendant, would not, is not implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.165" offset="11265040">The process of sentencing is not a, is, it it is a serious subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.567" offset="11290640">It's a, it's an important subject, one of the more important things, perhaps most important thing, that a trial judge, be it at the state court level or at the federal court level, has to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.684" offset="11331077">And as this Court noted in Bozza, that sentencing should not be transferred into, into a game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.920" offset="11360021">It should not be a situation where, uh, where a technical rule violates the legislative intent or the senator's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.455" offset="11398160">The situation you have in this case, if you affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is that you have transformed the sentencing process into a game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.102" offset="11436821">In particular, a game where the judge didn't have the rules, the sentencing judge didn't have the rules of the game until eight years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.299" offset="11469526">It's like playing Monopoly without having the rules that Milton Bradley gives you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.251" offset="11489380">It's just not, it's just not the way that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.843" offset="11499724">For the reasons stated, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit be reversed.</text>
