            <text syncTime="128.695" offset="660881">The chilling effect regarding the Sappenfield statute which has been discussed and which we will discuss, involves the facial presence of the potential enormously high jail sentence in connection with engaging in conduct, a presumptively protected by the First Amendment--</text>

            <text syncTime="207.817" offset="977380">Although, quite frankly, under the Indiana RICO statute, particularly in light of the semantical complication of the traditional RICO language and some greater elastic language under the scope provisions of the statute, there is probably a broader reach and a greater vagueness problem that might attend the usual Miller standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.460" offset="1059927">But, to deal with the Court's question, Justice White, you're quite correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.699" offset="1156894">That is to say, that the Indiana Supreme Court considered and approved in a final judgment all of the pretrial sanctions which were utilized and available, all of the post-trial sanctions which were the basis anticipatorily for the pretrial sanctions, and also the principle that conduct at one bookstore in a chain may be visited in terms of effect on other bookstores in the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.492" offset="1252084">With respect to Sappenfield in the court of appeals, the challenges to the facial constitutionality of the criminal RICO statute had been made in the trial court and in the appellate courts and they were rejected by the court of appeals in a rather brief opinion based on the Fort Wayne decision in the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.435" offset="1327839">So, under this court's decisions, the matters were certainly rendered to the highest courts in the state to consider them, were decided by those courts, and in terms of the overriding federal interest at stake here, would not be aided by remanding the causes to trial where further proceedings might occur which would prevent those issues from--</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.708" offset="5256969">Certainly in Times versus Sullivan this Court considered a relatively similar potential application of the same doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.690" offset="5320917">The Court viewed the potential possibility and concluded clearly that in terms of the potential for chilling effect and the harm to publication and to First Amendment Interest, the unrestricted potential for imposing that kind of damage award required a higher scienter standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.840" offset="5397508">And such was imposed, and that was the way the chill was dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.042" offset="5410255">The circumstance that we face here, obviously with an equally low scienter standard, or perhaps even a lower one and a more difficult to apply definition for the alleged wrongdoing may also require a heightened standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.843" offset="5465531">My point being not that that necessarily answers the question of why a fine is okay and something else is not, but simply that the court will not cast a blind eye to what the realities are of the circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.939" offset="5513909">I would also point out with respect to what the social interests are involved that it is not only the interests of the book seller that is being protected, but what is protected in this circumstance is the reciprocal right of the public to be able to receive presumptively protected material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.622" offset="5588620">And the notion of simply forfeiting unlitigated material removes such material from the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.876" offset="6757651">But the issue was clearly before the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.409" offset="6771757">The court of appeals went through the potential parade or horrors and struck down the statute or its face, in its entirety, for just those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.124" offset="6806657">And the Indiana Supreme Court rejected it and in essence rejected your concurring opinion in Arcara saying that there was absolutely no necessity of applying any First Amendment analysis here and end of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.462" offset="6859947">And simply said that the full range of RICO penalties is perfectly appropriate here, no different whether these materials are books or groceries or widgets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.801" offset="6949286">I would suggest, in concluding, with respect to the parallel to the Near versus Minnesota situation and the inapplicability of RICO because it's very clear that this court has maintained that in prior restraint cases the operation and effect of the legislation and of the procedures would be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.915" offset="7033818">And the Indiana Supreme Court was very clear, as was Mr. Goldsmith in his brief, that the basic purpose of RICO was remedial in order to deal with a perceived evil, in order to stop a particular kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.485" offset="7092019">And the remedy sought under the RICO statute is clearly not simply punishment for subsequent activities, but, instead, broadly remedial to eliminate a particular kind of undefined conduct prospectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.712" offset="13536949">So, the conviction or judgment for those offenses would throw the case back into the RICO analysis if there was a common enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.840" offset="13589508">And what we really have here is not a draconian response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.612" offset="13600584">I prefer to use the Russello analysis that we have new weapons of unprecedented scope and we're dealing with an organization with lots of money and so they're financial remedies, instead of the traditional criminal remedies, which put the store clerk in jail for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.270" offset="13655232">And we believe that these remedies post-trial, at least, fall within traditional First Amendment and Eighth Amendment literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.886" offset="13685638">And if they have an incidental effect under O'Brien and Albertini, that that effect is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.179" offset="13706850">And deprive the right of the state to use its sanctions in a racketeering law essentially and when it involves bookstores, provides a safe haven behind which narcotics dealers can buy a few books and provide a facade of respectability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.810" offset="13761393">We believe the state's sanctions should not be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.241" offset="13771111">This is really what this is; it's an Arcara case and it's not a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.763" offset="13793158">That the sanctions which ultimately come before this Court, need to be judged in terms of Eighth Amendment, a proportionality law as applies to all the RICO laws.</text>
