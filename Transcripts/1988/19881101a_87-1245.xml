            <text syncTime="14.902" offset="194557">Texas Monthly is a general interest magazine published by a commercial corporation in Texas with circulation of roughly 280,000 copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.365" offset="240428">It covers various topics of interest to people in Texas ranging from politics to religion, to sports, to food, to social occasions, to all sorts of things, to humor.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.469" offset="300823">It is not published by a religious faith, and it is not a religious magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.216" offset="323811">It is simply a commercial magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.903" offset="334574">It brought this lawsuit in the Travis County District Court in Travis County, Texas, to recover $149,107 in sales tax that it had paid in protest under the applicable Texas procedure for subscription sales during a period in 1985 when the state legislature had imposed a tax on subscription sales of magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.532" offset="453065">Now, the Texas sales and use tax system is a system similar to sales and use tax systems throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.715" offset="489845">Generally, any tangible personal property that someone purchases or uses in Texas is subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.851" offset="534358">Thus, if I go across the street from my office and buy a pair of socks, I have to pay 6.125 percent of the purchase price to the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.942" offset="574691">If I buy a typewriter, I have to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.159" offset="591618">If my wife brings back a blouse from Washington after this argument, she's supposed to pay a use tax when she puts it on because she owes 6.125 percent of the purchase price for using it in the state of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.490" offset="716902">There are a plethora of exemptions from this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.940" offset="738740">Horses and mules, for example, that are used as draft animals are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.235" offset="759847">As one might expect in Texas, drill stem bits for drilling equipment, all drilling equipment is exempt from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.748" offset="789940">And various other items are exempt from the tax ranging from fertilizer to airplanes to certain shrimp boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.713" offset="821809">Now, two of the exemptions that exist in this tax are relevant to the case this court has before it today.</text>

Section 310 of the statute... which is a general exemption from tax for charitable, religious, civic organizations, volunteer fire departments, the Boy Scouts, and the Chamber of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.816" offset="1058165">If any of those institutions... Goodwill Industries, for example... buys something... the Methodist Church... when my church buys something and uses it, it does not have to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.747" offset="1109888">There is no exemption for the sale of goods that is generally applicable to those institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.760" offset="1137996">So that if the St. Vincent de Paul Store down on Third and Brazos Street in Austin or the Goodwill store sells my magazine or sells a used bicycle or sells a used book, they have to collect the tax and remit it to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.785" offset="1206123">And if the tax isn't collected, the state comes after them for the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.632" offset="1489499">Now, the exemption that we're here about today reads that exempt from these taxes are periodicals that are published or distributed by a religious faith and they consist wholly of writings promulgating the teachings of the faith and books that consist wholly of writings sacred to a religious faith are exempt from the taxes imposed by this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.214" offset="6091752">And I think I got there, however, because it seems to me that any equal protection analysis requires the achievement of a legitimate stadient and to achieve a legitimate stadient, it cannot be a law respecting the establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.489" offset="6152879">And I believe that in addition to being Arkansas Writers' Project versus Ragland all over again, this case is also a law respecting the establishment of religion as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.384" offset="10588471">But that would fall within the definition of a sale under the Texas Sales and Use Tax Act, which is a transfer of tangible personal property for a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.722" offset="10625878">And under that particular case, as I said, it was a general regulatory-type situation, but it also was a tax that was being imposed upon the sale of these magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.200" offset="10695782">They had to pay the tax in advance, and they also had to obtain a license, and this is pretty much the same structure under the Texas Sales and Use Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.649" offset="10741548">The state, therefore, feels that it has asserted either rational basis or compelling state interest to sustain the exemption in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.783" offset="10806123">Texas Monthly has also raised the fact that Section 151.312 does not or... they say it does constitute a law respecting establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.355" offset="10872369">The position of the state is that the lower court correctly determined that this exemption does not fall under that category; that it meets a three-part test in Lemon versus Kurtzman: Number one, that it has a secular legislative purpose in that it restricts the physical relationship between church and state, and this is what the Court of Appeals in Texas so determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.590" offset="11013326">It also held that its primary purpose was not to advance or inhibit religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.541" offset="11037150">To the contrary, the effect was to permit religious periodicals, religious organizations in effect to be free from state sponsorship or support.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.529" offset="11157104">I think it probably should not be so rigidly applied in this type of context, but I think it should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.151" offset="11183540">And I think the exemption meets all elements of the test because I feel that it doesn't constitute excessive entanglement with religion in the respect that it doesn't create the appearance of an ongoing partnership between church and state that, like, say, a direct aid or subsidy would, even though you might refer to an exemption as being a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.248" offset="11299942">Certainly it has been held in the past that determining in the Walz case that real property being exclusively used for religious purposes didn't constitute an excessive entanglement with religion and also determined whether secular books that were to be given to students of parochial schools, there had to be a determination made there as to whether it contained religious material or whether it was secular in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.782" offset="11434107">That was held not to constitute excessive entanglement with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.920" offset="11450616">What the state is doing here is being mutual towards religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.732" offset="11469842">It is trying to accommodate religion by allowing for the free distribution of religious teachings and materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.477" offset="11516862">It is not advancing or inhibiting religion, it is a secular, legislative purpose, and it does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.394" offset="11576526">In the past in that area on advancing religion, just going back to that for a minute, it has already been held that time-release programs where students that were released from public schools to go off school grounds to attend religious instruction, that this type of program did not create a symbolic union between church and state so as to constitute an advancement of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.633" offset="11677463">I think this same sort of approach can be applied to tax case in that the voluntary sale and purchase of these types of religious periodicals likewise does not constitute excessive entanglement, does not advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.378" offset="11736500">It has been pointed out that under the Texas tax structure that what we have here is an exemption exempting the sales of religious periodicals based on content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.496" offset="11800970">We previously said we don't feel that the whole exemption is really content-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.602" offset="11825316">It's more status-based and activity-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.710" offset="11837751">There are other exemptions, however, in the Texas Sales and Use Tax Act, one of which is an exemption that allows religious organizations and other organizations to make one-day sales in a calendar year of any items that they so desire to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.297" offset="11916118">And I realize that is broader based than just the religious aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.263" offset="11935971">But, there's another exemption that permits the sale of food, food products by church or the church function, and that can occur any time during the church year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.038" offset="11991142">So there are other exemptions that are basically religious-based in the Texas Sales Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.286" offset="12016115">The state perceives this, as I've said earlier and submits to the Court that what we have here is a nondiscriminatory tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.437" offset="12064702">If the Court, however, perceives this as a situation where there is content-based discrimination, a strict scrutiny test should be applied and the exemption should be upheld under this type of test because what we have here is two competing constitutional interests, the right to free speech by the press and the right to free speech by religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.206" offset="12195733">And to avoid any violation of the free exercise clause or the establishment clause in which we feel a compelling state interest, we submit that the exemption should be upheld.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger James George, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3038.508" offset="12288938">Two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.241" offset="12303880">First, the Arkansas Writers' Project case involved an Arkansas general sales tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.628" offset="12345467">It provided a taxation of all tangible property, according to the court's opinion, in the state of Arkansas, and there were a series of exemptions, like in Texas, for mules and various things, but there was only an exemption for religious, trade, sports, and professional journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.571" offset="12429267">So, there were a lot of... or media, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.413" offset="12452569">The agricultural magazines, magazines about the oil and gas industry or other things were subject to tax, along with general interest magazines.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3088.519" offset="12489036">Well, all newspapers were exempted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_james_george_jr" startTime="3090.550" stopTime="3142.763">
            <label>Mr. Roger James George, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3090.550" offset="12497186">In Arkansas they exempted newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.222" offset="12503873">That was a separate grounds for writ petition in that area, in the appeal in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.016" offset="12522995">Second... and thus, this case is similar in that only the restriction is... does not include sports, professional journals and trade journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.919" offset="12562596">It just includes religion, one of the five topics that were involved in the Arkansas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.931" offset="12582658">And there the evidence was, according to this court's opinion, one to three magazines paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.006" offset="12614946">In our evidence, the Comptroller's people testified that 20 to 30 paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.081" offset="12639292">Given the relative size of Arkansas and Texas, I think that's a distinction without a difference in that we, in fact, have as few as 20 of the hundreds and hundreds of magazines that are circulated in Texas are subject to tax... not because of the exemptions, because of the enforcement policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.373" offset="12700418">Finally--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3142.763" offset="12705956">Because of what?</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger James George, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3143.950" offset="12710763">--Our enforcement policy argument that was part of the trial court evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.652" offset="12725600">Finally, let me point to the question of does the taxpayer get his money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.977" offset="12746812">And, in fact, if you look at this court's opinions about taxpayers contending statutes or schemes were unconstitutional for interstate commerce reasons, a whole range of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.972" offset="12794877">This court's Armco versus Hardesty case and West Virginia statute taxing certain interstate sales--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3171.471" offset="12820791">That may be somewhat different if the holding rests on an equal protection basis than it does on a commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.796" offset="12846182">Because our case... some of our cases have said when it's an equal protection violation, the state can choose whether to eliminate the favored treatment or the disfavored treatment and just make sure they're all treated equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.714" offset="12893829">--Well, I suppose the state has to... if it has a statute, it can repeal it and then solve the problem, and you can't repeal... I suppose you could repeal the... there is no equal protection in commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.630" offset="12941476">Obviously you can't tax it because in commerce you can't solve it by corrective legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.488" offset="12956941">You can solve this by corrective legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.096" offset="12967285">But you can't solve... courts don't have powers to impose taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.406" offset="12984526">It can't go out and make those people who distributed the Watchtower and the Baptist Standard and the Methodist Layman pay the tax because the legislature has exempted them.</text>
