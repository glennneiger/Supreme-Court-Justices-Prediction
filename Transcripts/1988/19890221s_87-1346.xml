            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86572">The third opinion for announcement by me today is Bonito Boats, Inc. verus Thunder Craft Boats, Inc. number 87-1346 and this case comes to us on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.024" offset="150624">In 1976, petitioner Bonito Boats a Florida corporation developed and marketed a boat hull design which enjoyed great commercial success.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.105" offset="194928">The petitioner did not seek federal patent protection for the design or for the utilitarian aspects of the boat hull or for the process by which the boats were produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.381" offset="244038">In 1983, after the hull design had been on sale for some six years, the Florida legislator passed a statute making it unlawful to use the direct molding process to duplicate any manufactured boat hull or the component parts of it without permission of the original manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.706" offset="325331">Shortly after the enactment of the Florida law, the petitioner brought suit against the Thunder Craft Boats, a Tennessee corporation, for duplicating petitioner's boat hulls in violation of the Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.942" offset="378308">The petitioner sought damages, injunctive relief and attorney's fees for the illegal copying.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.639" offset="401086">The Florida trial court dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.727" offset="413416">The Florida Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the dismissal finding that the Florida statute impermissibly interfered with the public use of unpatented designs.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.960" offset="462317">We then granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the judgment of the Florida Courts and a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit holding that a similar California law did not conflict with the federal patent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.712" offset="521354">In a unanimous opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.856" offset="549984">The Florida statute creates patent like rights in design and utilitarian concepts which are left unprotected by the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.397" offset="588123">The statute thus, conflicts with the strong federal policy embodied in the patent laws that unpatented items, in general circulation are the tools of creation itself, free for all members of the public to exploit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.628" offset="645070">The substantial protection against duplication offered by the Florida law could divert inventive effort away from the requirements of patentability established by congress over the last 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.811" offset="697733">We hold then that the Florida law is pre-empted by the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
