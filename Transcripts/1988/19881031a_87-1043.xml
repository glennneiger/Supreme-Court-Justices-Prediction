            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="11.762" offset="186096">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.525" offset="205114">This case presents a narrow question of statutory construction dealing with the rights of secured creditors under the Bankruptcy Code in the collateral securing their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.721" offset="269897">The question is to be distinguished from any question of priorities under the Code because the Code treats secured claims separately, and to the extent the collateral is consumed meeting the rights of secured creditors, it does not pass into the general assets of the estate available for distribution to other creditors, priority or general creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.630" offset="389538">The particular question concerns post-petition interest allowed to holders of secured claims by Section 506(b) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.999" offset="459024">The general rule under the Code is that all claimants who would have a basis for it in the absence of bankruptcy are allowed pre-petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.260" offset="512105">This is memorialized by negative implication in Section 502(b)(2), and the general rule further is that the right to interest is then cut off upon the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, except as the Code otherwise provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.828" offset="606354">The right to interest, incidentally, resumes again after the confirmation of the plan of the debtor in possession or of the trustee by the Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.683" offset="657763">This is provided by Section 1129 of the Code, which created the possibility of stretching out payments under the plan, and in return for that, all creditors whose payments are stretched out are given a right to interest, and the right to interest for federal tax creditors under the tax liens is in 1129(a)(9)(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="774792">So what we are really talking about is whether there is a right to interest during this intervening period, the post-petition, pre-confirmation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.447" offset="824843">And that's what we mean by post-petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.101" offset="839471">Now, the provision at issue is set forth on page 2 of the government's brief, and Section 502(b) is one of the provisions, and indeed, the most important provision in the Code that allows post-petition interest, and the precise question here which... and the Code in this provision deals with this question by statute for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.541" offset="969143">It was previously just a matter of judge-made rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.103" offset="983458">The question is whether Section 506(b) applies to all secured claims with respect to the right to post-petition interest, or whether it carries forward a distinction that had been recognized by some courts of appeals prior to the Code between consensual and nonconsensual secured claims, with only the consensual ones being awarded post-petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.696" offset="1133819">The consensual ones are those created by contract, typically, secured claims of financial institutions or other business institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.740" offset="1173943">The nonconsensual claims, in addition to the tax lien claims such as are involved here, would include mechanics' liens or workmen's liens or liens arising from the execution of a judgment, in favor of a judgment creditor such as a tort victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.418" offset="1268715">And the question is whether this category of claimants, including the government tax liens, benefit from the same rule that some courts previously applied only to claims created by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.738" offset="1350008">In the particular case it is stipulated that the collateral securing the government's tax lien which has been perfected is amply sufficient to cover both the claim and any interest that would be accrued under Section 506(b).</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="322.603" offset="1429420">Mr. Wallace, to what kinds of property does the government's tax lien extend?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="325.853" stopTime="472.401">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="325.853" offset="1442482">Well, typically to real property and any other assets to which a security interest could attach, the same as is true of many commercial liens today that are created by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.954" offset="1522834">There was a time when it was typical for the commercial lien to attach to only one particular piece of property, but it is much more commonplace in commercial practice now for the lien to be as oversecured as the secured creditor can make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.694" offset="1621786">And this is what is known in the pariance as an oversecured claim as well because it is secured by more than the value of the claim plus any interest that would be accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.702" offset="1689809">The starting point for any question of statutory interpretation is, of course the statutory language, and if we look at Section 506(b), it seems apparent from the language that two categories of rights to payments are set up in the final several lines of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.284" offset="1804121">There shall be allowed to the holder of such claim interest on such claim, set off by commas then from</text>
            <text syncTime="426.188" offset="1843827">"and any reasonable fees, costs or charges. "</text>
            <text syncTime="429.576" offset="1857306">provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.027" offset="1879145">Facially, that seems to provide for two different categories, a more comprehensive right to interest on any oversecured claim, and a qualified right to fees, costs or charges provided under an agreement, if the claim arises from an agreement, if those fees, costs or charges are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.641" offset="1989590">That would be the ordinary way to read the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.952" offset="2006831">The Respondent, in order to adapt the language of--</text>

            <text syncTime="472.401" offset="2028669">Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt for just a second?</text>
            <text syncTime="473.448" offset="2032849">It is true that the words "such claim"... you are saying there are two kinds of such claims, and you use the same words, "such claim", to describe both of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="496.049" offset="2123233">The beginning part of subsection (b) explains that we're talking only about oversecured claims and only to the extent that the oversecured aspect would cover the interest payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.154" offset="2179657">So the "such" really has to refer back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.776" offset="2194077">Otherwise, that limitation on the right to post-petition interest would be lost in the subsequent clauses.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.111" offset="2283520">Isn't... is it a little odd that there is nothing in the legislative history and nothing more explicit than the placement of commas to change a rule like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="550.436" offset="2340780">I would not say that there's nothing more explicit than the changing of commas, which I will get to in a moment, but I do, I do agree that the case probably never would have reached this Court if the legislative history had addressed this precise question, which it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.272" offset="2412147">If anything in the legislative history had said we are now rejecting the rule that several courts of appeals had adopted, there would be no basis on which any court would have ruled against the holders of a claim like ours, a nonconsensual, oversecured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.295" offset="2496157">And I don't think the case would be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.339" offset="3168340">There are several difficulties with this contention, as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.633" offset="3185580">In the first place, we should not start off erasing either words or punctuation as the approach to interpreting what Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.378" offset="3232496">Punctuation marks are put into statutes to clarify their meaning, and they should not be lightly discarded or ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.873" offset="3278472">In the second place, and I think of very considerable importance, erasing the commas at issue here would create an ambiguity rather than resolve an ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.210" offset="3343883">It seems to us that while the statute is quite clear as written, there would be an ambiguity without the commas as to whether the doctrine of the last antecedent, a maxim of statutory construction that we discuss on pages 16 and 17 of our brief, would still require the same reading that we say is plain on the face with the commas.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.559" offset="3453283">We have cited several cases there in which courts have held that the modifying language under the doctrine of the last antecedent applies only to the words or phrases immediately preceding the modifying language.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.536" offset="3525172">The very first case that we cite there, Quindlen v. Prudential Insurance Company, is one in which there were no commas between the provisions of the statutory language at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.936" offset="3582746">It was a section of the Louisiana insurance Code that said this section shall not apply to temporary life insurance binders nor to contracts of live or health and accident insurance which do not contain a provision for cancellation prior to the date to which premiums have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.039" offset="3651187">And the question is whether that modifying language related back to the beginning language or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.488" offset="3689012">There was no comma there.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.004" offset="3695073">So the suggestion is one that would introduce an ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.737" offset="3717956">The third problem with their suggestion is that it would be an awkward way to draft this provision to accomplish the result for which they contend, not only because of the ambiguity that would then exist, but because the Code elsewhere, when it wants to refer only to consensual secured claims, uses a term of art, security interest, which is defined in the definitions section of the Code, in Section 101(45), as "a lien created by agreement".</text>
            <text syncTime="937.156" offset="3887647">So there would have been a way provided for in the definitions section of the Code itself to accomplish that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.340" offset="3920353">And the fourth and also quite important fault with the suggestion that we need only erase the commas, is that under their reading of the language, it would still constitute a departure from the prior cases, as we explain in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.909" offset="4006661">It just would be a departure from the prior court of appeals cases that they would favor to the one that the language appears to suggest because they would prevail in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.014" offset="4055040">But under the prior cases, the distinction was based entirely on the method under which the security was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.322" offset="4100284">It was a distinction simply between consensual and nonconsensual liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.116" offset="4127452">But those cases did not hold what the language of 506(b) obviously would require, that a court would have to look to the terms of the agreement in the consensual lien to see whether the agreement provides for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.422" offset="4196728">If the lien was consensual, it didn't matter whether the agreement specified interest under the old cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.029" offset="4223164">So they would still be contending for a departure from the law unless the words the Congress enacted are to be totally ignored, contrary to every principle of approaching statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.303" offset="4280216">Now, in addition to the language of the statute, the context rather strongly suggests that oversecured claims are referred to comprehensively in Section 506(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.392" offset="4340611">It is part of Section 506, which is the general provision that defines the determination of secured status for all categories of secured claims, and as we explain in our brief, each of the other subsections obviously refers comprehensively to all categories of secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.600" offset="4441443">So there is no reason suggested by the context for reading Section 506(b) more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.378" offset="4480523">Then if we look to the legislative history, it simply does not address this question, which seems on balance to be to our advantage to us because this could not qualify as one of the rare cases in which literal application of the statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.272" offset="4592118">There's nothing to show that the drafters did not intend this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.645" offset="4613643">And it seems to us that the Court of Appeals and Respondents are trying to give more weight that can be borne by the mere absence of an explicit indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to change the role that had been adopted by some courts of appeals but in which the Service, incidentally, had never acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.696" offset="4725760">And that's why the question had continued to be litigated up to the time of the enactment of the Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.528" offset="5325114">We have discussed the legislative history in some detail to show that Congress was well aware of reasons why the rationale that had been expressed in the prior cases had become largely outmoded by changes in commercial practice and by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 which adopted an approach to notification of other creditors of federal tax liens and clarification of filings that was quite comparable to the protection afforded by the Uniform Commercial Code for consensual liens, so that the two main rationales that had been expressed in the older cases, that it was harder for creditors to find out about tax liens, and that consensual liens typically applied only to one piece of property, had both become largely obsolete, and Congress was aware that they had become obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.796" offset="5606191">So there is considerable reason why Congress would not have wanted to preserve the old rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.981" offset="5642972">And then on the last two pages of our reply brief, pages 13 and 14, we explain an anomaly that would be introduced into five... Section 506 itself if the old rule were read into 506(b) because 506(d) gives a secured claimholder the right to skip the bankruptcy process altogether and preserve his claim, and that way he would have a right to interest, and he would have an incentive to skip the bankruptcy process if he had to sacrifice his right to post-petition interest in order to invoke his rights under 506(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.587" offset="5821336">So all of these reasons add up to us to the proposition that the proper course for the courts here in interpreting this provision is to take Congress at its word and give effect to the provision as Congress enacted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.206" offset="8667847">The case law developed exceptions to the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.564" offset="8681326">The general rule, as you have suggested, Chief Justice, is in Section 502.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.655" offset="8701597">That section says that interest does not accrue after the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.388" offset="8720614">The exceptions to that rule were discussed in the case law, and there were three exceptions that were developed as a result of the cases that discussed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.276" offset="8760111">The first exception said that interest was allowed in those estates where the debtor was solvent; where there was enough to pay all creditors both principal and interest, interest was allowed to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.035" offset="8811207">The second exception arose in the situation where the secured creditor was in possession of the collateral, and the collateral earned income after the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.579" offset="8853316">In that situation the secured creditor is entitled to interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.312" offset="8868258">The only exception that the government says applies today is the third exception, and that's the exception that evolved that allowed interest in situations where the collateral exceeded the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.664" offset="8917682">But all of the courts of appeal that decided the issue before the adoption of the Bankruptcy Code stated unequivocally that interest is not to be paid to an oversecured tax claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.910" offset="8970658">And those are the decisions that we've cited in our brief, and there are a number of reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.033" offset="8991138">First of all, as an aside, I think it's important to note that the Internal Revenue never asked at the time of the adoption of the Code and at the time of all of the revisions to the Code after that in 1978, never asked that interest be paid on the oversecured claims due Internal Revenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.468" offset="13712927">The very first of the pre-Code cases we cite on page 25, In re Kerber, is one in which the court of appeals said that the exception has been recognized by the courts to the extent of allowing post-bankruptcy interest to creditors who are deemed to have bargained for collateral to secure not only the principal obligation but the interest thereon as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.082" offset="13819403">As the questioning has suggested, the law ordinarily deems that when a payment is due on a certain date and it isn't made on that date, that interest is then implied to the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.812" offset="13874260">Now, this Court's decisions in Midlantic and Kelly quite properly were cautious about affecting areas other than bankruptcy, important areas such as abandonment of property to the detriment of health and safety or obligations to make restitution to victims of crime, which Congress could not have, may not have anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.801" offset="13978227">But here we are dealing with a core bankruptcy matter, and to refuse to give effect to what Congress enacted because of an absence of legislative history is not easy to reconcile with Article I of the Constitution which goes not require legislative history in order for Congress to make a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.669" offset="14049698">A majority vote in each House and the signature of the President is enough to supersede prior judge-made law.</text>
