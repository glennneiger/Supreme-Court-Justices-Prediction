            <text syncTime="1659.618" offset="6780089">I mean, we've shown that in our opening brief that there's a great waiver factor, not only in misdemeanor cases generally, but in DUI cases in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.356" offset="6814988">And it is also true in the Baldwin case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.013" offset="10157617">That's correct, and, and the Duncan ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.572" offset="10163886">The application of Duncan, that Duncan made of the Sixth Amendment to the states, is limited to the extent to which it is applied in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.298" offset="10206832">I submit that that... that would be the only alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.741" offset="10220520">You'd have to overrule... you'd have to extend it beyond that provided to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.524" offset="10235671">Now, I think Frank illustrates the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.284" offset="10242776">Frank was a federal criminal contempt matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.166" offset="10254270">And the court in sentencing... rather, suspended sentence on Ben Frank and instead imposed a three-year term of probation with, and I wish to note, the specific probationary conditions imposed on Mr. Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.909" offset="10321248">First, he was not allowed to travel outside the state without permission of the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.122" offset="10342041">He was required to work regularly, secondly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.523" offset="10355730">Thirdly, he has required to report any changes in his work schedule with his probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.897" offset="10385196">He was told he could only associate with law-abiding persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.081" offset="10401914">And he was to maintain reasonable work hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.555" offset="10431798">I submit that those conditions placed on the probationer in the Frank case are much more forceful restraint on liberty than are the collateral consequences to which the Petitioners rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.646" offset="10488223">I believe this puts Petitioners, in, in essence, in a checkmate position on their argument out of which they cannot come without overturning that... the basic ruling of Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.454" offset="10535452">Again, the critical distinction in the Sixth Amendment jury trial and Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel cases is the deprivation of liberty, the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.020" offset="10585712">Specifically, with regard to some of the collateral consequences to which the Petitioners allude, I think a short analysis is appropriate and especially in comparison with the probationary provisions in the Frank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.373" offset="10659063">The mandatory jail provision is ameliorated by the fact that the defendant could perform the 48 hours of community service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.527" offset="10691664">It's further ameliorated by the fact that characteristically courts credit the individual for the time he served in jail at his arrest and do not require an additional two days, if in fact he served two days before he came before the magistrate for his initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.868" offset="10753104">Secondly, Petitioners have referred to the enhancement aspect of the DUI statute; that is, that for second and third offenses, the penalty rises, and on the third offense it would become a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.616" offset="10800020">That is not an unusual statutory scheme, because of the habitual criminal act we have in Nevada and that many states provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.542" offset="10835756">For example, after the third petty larceny, it becomes a felony upon prosecution and conviction of the fourth petty larceny if the, the district attorney determines to file it as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.569" offset="10875880">And that calls for a mandatory minimum of ten years in prison with a maximum of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.333" offset="10898972">Moreover, in the petty larceny realm still, after the fifth petty larceny conviction... that is, upon the sixth petty larceny... the statute provides for life imprisonment in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.379" offset="10943067">Cannot the same argument be made, unlike what I think counsel for Petitioners has suggested, that someone may come before this Court, if they're able to reach this level, and argue in a petty larceny case that, well, I'm subject to enhanced penalties, and if I commit five more petty larcenies, I'll go to prison for life, therefore, it's serious in the constitutional context?</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.385" offset="11031152">I believe this is analogous to their argument regarding enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.338" offset="11042959">It also holds true for the domestic battery situation, with regard to enhancement and also with regard to the claim that the social program that accompanies the conviction for DUI is somehow significant enough to elevate what is otherwise a petty offense into the serious category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.900" offset="11117147">For example, in domestic battery in Nevada, the officer must make an arrest if there was a battery committed between persons who are related by blood or marriage and there is some other evidence, such as physical evidence, to indicate that that crime has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.281" offset="11186737">That person cannot make bail for 12 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.763" offset="11196663">It's a non-bailable offense, which at this point of, course, is merely an accusatory stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.875" offset="11221114">In addition, there are other collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.489" offset="11235534">Once a, a battery conviction results, the court has the ability to require the person to attend a counseling program, and if the victim is over... is 65 years of age or older, the Nevada statutes provide for, in effect, a doubling of the punishment, in which case it would arise into a serious offense and a jury trial right would have to be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.213" offset="11326440">But what these illustrate, these examples I've explained, is the fallacy in taking the Petitioners' approach of viewing the nature of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.309" offset="11366877">The clear-cut guideline established by the objective approach that Baldwin indicates by looking to the maximum authorized penalty is, to paraphrase the Frank decision, the only objective criterion by which a line could ever be drawn on the basis of the possible penalty alone is how we separate petty from serious offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.786" offset="11952752">Regarding the nature of the offense test and the... the reason I think why it's too subjective is best illustrated by language from Clawans which was reiterated in the Frank opinion, wherein it stated that doubts must be resolved not subjectively by recourse of the judge to his own sympathy and emotions, but by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.122" offset="12058077">One other point I wish to make with regard to the national standards test to which Petitioners refer, and that is what I call the head count of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.500" offset="12111576">I don't believe that has constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.084" offset="12121921">Although it appears as though 44 states provide jury trials for persons accused with a first-offense DUI, they do so for one of three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.940" offset="12157343">First off, their state constitution requires it; or secondly, their state statutory scheme requires it; and thirdly, the other reason why they provide jury trials is because the maximum authorized penalty exceeds six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.047" offset="12209796">It exceeds the Baldwin bright line anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.980" offset="12217529">So, I don't believe that that is... it's in essence a red herring to argue that 44 states provide it and therefore Nevada should in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.153" offset="12246159">Morever, in Martin v. Ohio, this Court held that there was no constitutional dimension to the fact that 48 states had a particular approach to a criminal procedure, in that case the self-defense argument, and which side has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.734" offset="12308539">In that instance, Ohio and South Carolina were recognized as the only two states that placed the burden of proving self-defense on the defendant.</text>
