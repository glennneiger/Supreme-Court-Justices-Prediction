            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134457">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1167, Price Waterhouse v. Ann B. Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.346" offset="163819">Ms. Oberly, you may begin whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="79.852" stopTime="185.413">
            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="79.852" offset="453778">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="83.345" offset="467779">This is a challenge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to Price Waterhouse's decision not to make Respondent a partner in the firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.570" offset="500694">The District Court in this case, after a five-day trial, found that Price Waterhouse had legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.868" offset="533921">The District Court also found that Respondent failed to prove that those reasons were a pretext for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="560462">Under this Court's Title VII decisions, including the ones that have been discussed in the last hour, those findings should have resulted in a judgment for Price Waterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.826" offset="597660">But then something inexplicable happened in the District Court's reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.869" offset="613856">After making the findings that should have ended the case in favor of Price Waterhouse, the District Court went on to hold that three factors, each of which was innocent by itself, somehow combined to produce a Title VII violation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.359" offset="671848">None of those factors was found to be evidence of intentional discrimination, or evidence that discrimination had in fact caused Respondent any injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.084" offset="706748">But the District Court nevertheless concluded that Price Waterhouse violated Title VII because the firm failed to take affirmative steps to purge or purify its decision-making process of an unquantifiable, unconscious, and unintentional element of sex stereotyping.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.567" offset="780622">This finding of a tainted process at Price Waterhouse led the District Court to characterize the case as one involving mixed motives for the employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.904" offset="818029">On that basis of the mixed motive characterization, the Court then held that it became Price Waterhouse's burden to prove, and to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that its decision would have been the same even if the process hadn't been tainted.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.413" offset="876021">As you put it, the District Court must have... if there was a mixed motive, didn't it necessarily find that one of the reasons for the refusal was, was gender based?</text>

            <text syncTime="203.395" offset="948015">Justice White, that's the part of the opinion that I frankly find inexplicable, and somewhat I like an O'Henry novel, because he first found all the factors that should have resulted in Price Waterhouse's winning this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.353" offset="995766">He then found that he was unable to conclude what role the supposedly illegitimate motive played in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.898" offset="1025964">He didn't say it played a significant role.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="260.661" offset="1177056">Well, you argue for some "but for" standard of causation?</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="268.097" offset="1206836">Choosing between those labels, we argue for a "but for" standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.800" offset="1229615">But I actually think that all of the labels of causation floating around in this case, including those supplied by the Solicitor General, just add an element of confusion to what to me is a relatively straightforward question.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="286.078" offset="1278725">Well, what, what is the liability situation in a case when there are two independently sufficient causes for a particular employer's action, either one of which would be sufficient in and of itself, and one of which is an illegitimate reason, such as racial or gender discrimination?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="310.793" stopTime="400.623">
            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="310.793" offset="1377572">Then the situation we have, Justice O'Connor, is basically who wins in the case of a tie?</text>
            <text syncTime="317.158" offset="1403068">Who wins if the District Court, as was the case here, is unable to decide which motive actually caused the decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.073" offset="1430653">And our position on that issue is that the answer has to be for the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.766" offset="1449461">The Plaintiff brought this case, and if the Plaintiff can't prove by a preponderance of the evidence, and we don't suggest that she be held to any higher standard than preponderance, even though she would hold us to a clear and convincing standard, if she can't show by a preponderance that the discriminatory motive actually caused the result she's complaining about, then there's no sound reason either in policy or in this Court's prior precedence for holding that the employer has violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.812" offset="1553637">Because you have on the other side of the ledger an overwhelming proof, accepted by the District Court here, that the employer acted for legitimate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.508" offset="1588433">And you have throughout both the language and the legislative history of Title VII, you have starting with the language, you have Congress saying, it is only unlawful for an employer to act because of a prohibited reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.688" offset="1641200">You have the legislative history which shows that the opponents of the bill were extremely concerned that the statute was going to cut much too deeply into employers' traditional freedom to make employment decisions for any reason they wanted to, as long as it wasn't a prohibited reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.447" offset="1700237">The effect of the Court of Appeals' mixed motive analysis, which basically awards the tie to the plaintiff in a case where you can't decide what the cause was.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="400.623" offset="1736913">Well, you tell us you don't like labels, but it seems to me we have to use labels at times in order to describe to District and trial courts what they should do, and that the answer you have just given to Justice O'Connor is that the Plaintiff must show "but for" causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.466" offset="1816220">If we need a label, that is the answer I would give.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.139" offset="1830953">But I submit that for district courts and litigants to actually trying this case, or this type of case, the much simpler formulation is to say to those parties and to the Court, the question you're looking at is did the prohibitive motive make a difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="438.768" offset="1889468">That's the same as "but for" causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.631" offset="1896886">Maybe the meaning, though, and maybe what lower courts have done in if there are two reasons established, one legitimate, one illegitimate, maybe the burden shifts to the employer at that stage to do something.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.399" offset="2019975">It's certainly what the Court of Appeals held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.441" offset="2032201">We find that there are numerous problems with that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.697" offset="2053203">The first one is before we even get to who has the burden, we have a substantive question of what is the standard of liability under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.673" offset="2089148">Is it "but for" causation?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.533" offset="2096566">It is causation that made a difference to the outcome?</text>
            <text syncTime="493.515" offset="2108478">If that's the case, then this Court's Title VII decisions hold, then it always remains the plaintiff's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.580" offset="2136690">It never shifts on the plaintiff's burden to show that she was the victim of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.204" offset="2159260">If she can't establish causation, in other words if she can't establish that the action she's challenging has caused by the prohibitive motive, then there's no sound reason compatible with Title VII's purposes to give the judgment to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.413" offset="2216103">So that what you're doing, one of the phrases, besides the many different causation labels floating around in this case, one of the phrases that also permeates the case is the notion that the employer in this situation is a "proven wrongdoer".</text>
            <text syncTime="536.705" offset="2281200">And I think that's in part the question you're asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.075" offset="2294679">But I would point out that the employer in this case is simultaneously a proven right doer, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.429" offset="2320070">In other words, the Court has found that the employer has acted at least as much for a legitimate motive, which Congress clearly didn't intend to punish, as it has for an illegitimate motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.507" offset="2360403">And again, I come back to it being the Plaintiff's burden to bring the ball over the 50-yard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.731" offset="2385376">If she can't, show by a preponderance of the evidence that the prohibitive motive caused the injury she's suing to redress, then it's quite unclear why you are awarding her a judgment--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="572.626" offset="2424873">Well, there's language in a number of cases out there that it's enough to show that the discriminatory reason was a substantial factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.171" offset="2459041">--There this, that language appears, and in this Court's cases I think it doesn't translate to the Title VII setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.429" offset="2500106">In this Court's cases it appears in two cases, the Transportation Management case and the Mt. Healthy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.362" offset="2519855">Neither of those cases dealt with either Title VII-specific language or with the legislative history of Title VII, which shows extensive Congressional debate about, on the one hand preserve, making sure that employers were not allowed to act for prohibited reasons but at the same time ensuring employers complete freedom to make employment decisions based on any other reason than a prohibited reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.399" offset="2612015">And what the Court of Appeals analysis does here by resorting to significant factor or motivating factor, as opposed to "but for" causation, is allow a plaintiff to establish liability even though the record also establishes that the employer acted for a perfectly legitimate reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.669" offset="2741059">The Court upheld the significant factor and then burden-shifting approach in that case, because the Board, the National Labor Relations Board, presented that to the Court as its interpretation of its own statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.496" offset="2792364">The Court simultaneously said that it would have been perfectly acceptable, and perfectly plausible and reasonable and something the Court would have upheld, had the Court, had the Board taken the position under the NLRA that we take here under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.877" offset="2853908">Essentially, the Court said it was a matter for the Board's discretion, and it was unwilling to overturn the policy judgment that the Board had made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.061" offset="2886614">But none of that bears on how Title VII should be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.374" offset="2895913">And then a final factor that makes this case quite different from Transportation Management and Mt. Healthy is that in those cases, as you've noted, at least the triggering predicate for shifting the burden was a finding that the prohibited motive was either a substantial or a significant or a motivating factor in the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.701" offset="3549184">And before the Court wrestles with the difficult burden-shifting issues, it's quite important that it understand the consequences as applied by the Court of Appeals of attaching the mixed motive label to any particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.146" offset="3646986">The evidence showed, the District Court found, and the Court of Appeals did not disagree, that from the very beginning of Respondent's tenure at Price Waterhouse there were significant problems in her ability to get along with staff and peers.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.919" offset="3726085">But at the time of the partnership decision in this case she had not in fact taken any action to correct them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.582" offset="3748759">So the issue in this case really wasn't, should Ann Hopkins be made a partner, but should Ann Hopkins either be rejected outright or placed on hold for future consideration?</text>
            <text syncTime="914.110" offset="3790868">We basically don't have in this case enough evidence of the type that the Court had in Transportation Management or in Mt. Healthy to characterize this as a mixed motive case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.427" offset="6732152">But the District Judge in this case did, I think, a remarkably careful job, and I think unfortunately Ms. Oberly has rather scanted what the findings say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.974" offset="6774261">He found in the final order, which is on page 62 of the appendix to the petition, the discrimination caused in part a denial of this partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.891" offset="6813967">It did so because Price Waterhouse did not protect the partnership evaluation process from stereotyped attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.026" offset="6846464">Before he got to that he built very carefully the reason why it took three elements to find that Price waterhouse had done this with what is the equivalent of a corporate or a firm intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.928" offset="6986166">Yes, we have thought all along that what, what we are perhaps being assailed for, or what Judge Gesell is being assailed for, is being careful in this case, not overstating what he found, that this is a classic mixed motives case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.459" offset="7040292">And unfortunately they don't subject themselves to the kind of analysis that the bean-counting approach of the government's brief seems to suggest, because there is no way that votes get counted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.254" offset="7083446">What happens is this is a process in which there is in effect a veto power in a relatively small group of objectors among the partners who comment on this, because that is what the policy committee takes note of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.454" offset="7136214">And we had that from the senior partner, Joseph Connor, when we took his deposition de bene esse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.988" offset="7158366">That is the decisive factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.698" offset="7169233">Using subjective standards, collegial decision-making, which is as hard to penetrate as the kind of legislative and administrative decision making that this Court talked about in the Arlington Heights case, Price Waterhouse relies very heavily and gives great weight and leverage to the comments of these partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.611" offset="7248854">Now, the evidence that was given about what those comments mean is quite full, and it's all in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.038" offset="7282604">Not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.937" offset="7286157">There are some obvious things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.510" offset="7292426">There is that comment about dressing more femininely, walking more femininely, talking more femininely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.923" offset="7314055">That's said by one of the two messengers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.926" offset="7330147">That is the messenger from the policy board in the partnership, and that's what Judge Gesell found, to Ms. Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.781" offset="7361494">There is also another messenger who comes from the local office where she's being nominated to the policy board, and that was Roger Marcellin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.339" offset="7395766">And he's the man who said, I have no doubt that Tom Beyer, the man who made those remarks, knew exactly what to tell her, where the problems lay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.434" offset="7432129">That was in response to a question by the Judge, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.657" offset="7444981">But the predicate for this, "caused in part", and do think that that is really stronger than played a role or a motivating factor or a substantial factor, and I see no reason why any of those tests wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.016" offset="7490434">One could even use the definition of material in the Kungys case as a natural tendency to influence the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.318" offset="7519691">But whatever, whatever formulation of that is used, here there was a finding that was caused in part and the predicate for that finding was a series of decisions, of statements in Judge Gesell's decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.340" offset="7583744">He said, although the stereotyping by individual partners may have been unconscious on their part, the maintenance of a system that gave weight to such biased criticisms was a conscious act of the partnership as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.328" offset="7635675">And he said then almost in the next sentence, and I'm reading at 56 and 57, the Plaintiff appears to have been a victim of emissive and subtle discrimination created by a system that made evaluations based on outmoded attitudes, that is stereotyping, determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.850" offset="7701817">Determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.549" offset="7708609">Hard to find a more decisive word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.891" offset="7718013">And then finally, before he went on to talk about mixed motives where he said again, discrimination played a role in the employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.569" offset="7752704">Before he went on to say that, he said, the court finds that the policy board's decision not to admit the Plaintiff to partnership was tainted by discriminatory evaluations that were the direct result of its failure, the policy board's, to address the evident problem of sexual stereotyping in partnership evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.960" offset="7834206">Now, this isn't a question of the 50-yard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.452" offset="7844237">This is a question of two motives possibly playing a part, and what must the Plaintiff show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.017" offset="7870464">That we thought was the first main issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.097" offset="7882793">What we believe the Plaintiff must show is clearly marked by this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.882" offset="7901915">A motivating factor, a substantial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.366" offset="7911841">And Transportation Management, I believe, characterized Mt. Healthy as saying, played a role.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.129" offset="9926927">So I don't think... and, but we just don't think Title VII gets boxed that way, so that 7(a)(2) is, 703(a)(2) is disparate impact and not disparate treatment as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.884" offset="10205915">But that, if one says that, I also think clear and convincing says something about the kind of proof that is wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.201" offset="10371218">That is the kind of impossible burden of proof that will simply extinguish Title VII suits and collegial decision making would likely, by subjective standards, would likely become a very common form of practice, because it would be impenetrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.332" offset="10427747">And that too, given the policy of the act, the history of the act, the defeat of the McClellan Amendment, with Senator Case, is a very clear statement about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.528" offset="10468498">The 1972 amendment, when this Court said that a new statute that said, any discrimination is, violates this act, and said that is assimilated to the standards under old Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.995" offset="10522415">All of that, we think, argues for saying, liability is not a demanding standard, or anywhere near the demanding standard that Price Waterhouse insists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.963" offset="10562225">Remedy is where they may be able to show that they did something that should not have a consequence of the sort that we ask for in the complaint in this case.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="2625.215" offset="10635264">There are just two points I'd like to address, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.327" offset="10647698">The first is Plaintiff's contention that our position puts an impossible burden of proof on the Plaintiff in a Title VII action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.861" offset="10677895">That's simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.484" offset="10684374">This Court in Burdine recognized that the Plaintiff has full access to the EEOC's investigatory files, as well as to discovery in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.741" offset="10721363">And this case well bears that out, because by the time this case went to trial, Plaintiff knew as much about Price Waterhouse's decision-making process as Price Waterhouse itself knobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.949" offset="10762219">She was not laboring under any handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.000" offset="10774444">And to make her prove her case is simply not unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.282" offset="10787505">The second point I'd like to address is Plaintiff's theory that the way to deal with this class of cases is to draw a distinction between liability and remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.098" offset="10826793">That distinction does not work and does not make sense in the type of case Plaintiff brought, of an individual disparate treatment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.235" offset="10859394">If she succeeds in proving causation in that type of claim, then she's entitled to full relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.221" offset="10887293">You may need to measure, you may need to have quantification on the amount of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.384" offset="10907982">You may need to work out the specifics of the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.555" offset="10920625">But there's no doubt that she gets full relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.036" offset="10930552">On the other hand, it she cant, establish causation, there is no justification, and in fact there are serious Article III problems with giving her partial relief, Article III problems giving her an injunction when she's no longer there to enforce it, when she hasn't brought a class action, and there are no other women who can show that they're affected by Price Waterhouse's future conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.098" offset="11006829">And you certainly would not give her attorneys' fees for establishing a process violation when she can't show that that process harmed her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.745" offset="11037340">So that the liability/remedy dichotomy that the Plaintiff is urging the Court to adopt makes sense in a different type of Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.510" offset="11080495">It makes sense in disparate impact cases, it makes sense in class action cases, it makes sense in pattern or practice cases, where the liability showing does not require the establishment of "but for" causation, and you leave to a separate remedy stage whether particular individuals have been harmed and should be the beneficiaries of specific relief, such as reinstatement or back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.596" offset="11168788">But in her type of case, those inquiries merge into the liability determination, And if she can't get over the liability hurdle, you simply don't reach the remedial phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.342" offset="11211734">Thank you.</text>
