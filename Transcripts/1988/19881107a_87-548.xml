            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="13.122" offset="191764">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.490" offset="205243">This case arises from an economic strike against TWA by the union representing its flight attendants, known as IFFA.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.864" offset="242755">When the strike was called off by the union in May of 1986, after more than two months, TWA was operating a full schedule with a workforce consisting of 2,800 new hires and some 1,200 incumbents, or crossovers... that is, pre-strike flight attendants who chose to remain at work or to resume working during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.134" offset="367829">At that time, there were only 200 vacancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.686" offset="382040">TWA filled them by re-hiring unreinstated strikers in seniority order.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.191" offset="412028">Since that time, more than 2,500 strikers have been rehired to fill additional vacancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.797" offset="442435">Upon rehire, they have been credited with their full pre-strike seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.201" offset="468035">The Eighth Circuit, however, held that TWA had violated the Railway Labor Act when the strike ended because it did not remove incumbents from their jobs and replace them with strikers who had more pre-strike seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="537625">Since the court below, however, affirmed the right of new hires under the Railway Labor Act to keep their jobs against the claims of unreinstated strikers, the question raised by its decision is why the Railway Labor Act, unlike the NLRA, requires a carrier at the end of a strike to treat some 1,200 incumbent employees less favorably than new hires.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="130.349" offset="660610">Maybe they were wrong about new hires.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="murray_gartner" startTime="132.967" stopTime="465.750">
            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="132.967" offset="671163">I don't think they were, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.419" offset="688926">There's 50 years of precedent which says they're right, and the Solicitor General has filed a brief on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board which says that they were right.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.178" offset="747963">The District Court thought they were right and I think... I think they're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.784" offset="774399">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="160.184" offset="780041">To the extent that that decision, however, was based on the Eighth Circuit's view of the NLRA decisions, I will leave the argument that the Court misapprehended long-established NLRA law to the Solicitor General, who is here on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.032" offset="859349">I will address the arguments about the RLA, which the Respondent now makes without any support from the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.720" offset="898115">Respondent says that the RLA section 2 Fourth... and this Court's decision in Florida East Coast Railway, require that the risk of job loss inherent in any strike much be shifted from those who choose to remain on strike to those employees who choose to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.086" offset="987558">Neither the statutory section, we believe, nor the Court's decision, separately or together, lead to that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.192" offset="1027996">Section 2 Fourth clearly is focused, as its first sentence reveals, on the employees'</text>
            <text syncTime="230.761" offset="1062268">"right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="236.849" offset="1086614">It does not mention strikes, strikers, or concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.938" offset="1110961">By contrast, the NLRA has Section 23, which defines strikers as employees until they secure substantially equivalent employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.596" offset="1165609">RLA section 1 Fifth, however, contains no such definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.150" offset="1187865">Section 7 and 8(a)(1) of the NLRA taken together like RLA section 2 Fourth prohibit interference or coercion in the employees' right to form or join unions or not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.063" offset="1267486">But in addition, those sections specifically and broadly protect concerted activities, and have no counterpart in the RLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.371" offset="1312730">NLRA Section 13 also without any counterpart in the RLA specifically protects the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.894" offset="1350869">RLA section 2 Fourth, therefore, cannot reasonably be thought to give more protection to strikes and strikers than the specific provisions of the NLRA dealing with those subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.253" offset="1416280">If anything, it must give less.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.538" offset="1425370">Most of the decisions of the lower courts construing it, in fact, as the amicus brief of the Air Conference shows, have confined that section to pre-certification interference with the organization of unions, or with an egregious threat to the representation function of a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.423" offset="1524949">Certainly Respondent cites no case in which Section 2 Fourth has been construed as broader in scope than the NLRA provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.794" offset="1570402">And this Court's decisions under the NLRA have made it very clear that even though the filling of places left vacant by strikers may have a coercive effect on the exercise of the right to strike, it is not prohibited coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.340" offset="1636649">Congress permitted that effect as part of the intended balance between the exercise of self-help by employer and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.679" offset="1673952">The remainder of Respondent's argument about the RLA is that this Court's decision in Florida East Coast Railway... of course the Court is familiar with that decision, and the discussion of it which we had in the case which we refer to as TWA 1, which is still pending, petition for rehearing in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.829" offset="1774575">The Respondent says that that decision requires the continuation of pre-strike working conditions into and beyond the self-help period.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.352" offset="1816685">Respondent argues that therefore the seniority system as it refers to it, in the 1981-84 contract between TWA and IFFA, which the District Court held did not include any right of unreinstated strikers to displace incumbents... that that seniority system somehow expands because of the statute to confer that right of displacement after the expiration date of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.740" offset="1946252">In other words, Respondent says that a right conferred neither by contract nor by statute somehow is born from the interplay of that contract and that statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="470.654" offset="2021903">But even if the... even if the contract does subsist, there is no right in that contract of the sort that was the basis for the decision here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="murray_gartner" startTime="478.991" stopTime="533.144">
            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="478.991" offset="2055235">Yes, Your Honor, yes, Justice Scalia, we would.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.676" offset="2065997">As a matter of fact, we argued in TWA 1, as Your Honor is aware, that FEC does not require the continuation of contracts which have expired by their terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.900" offset="2110823">But even if it did, it could not impose on the carrier the obligation to observe a seniority right not granted by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.006" offset="2143320">And clearly if this Court should hold that the contract including all of the seniority provisions which it did have has expired, there then cannot be any basis on which to say that because those particular and limited seniority provisions once existed, seniority principles in Respondents' words require the carrier in the self-help period to allow unreinstated strikers to displace incumbent employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.144" offset="2271842">Mr. Gartner, I got the impression that the Eighth Circuit decision in what you called TWA 1 depended more than its decision in this case did upon its construction of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.737" offset="2330252">Your Honor, we thought you were wrong, and we argued that at that time, that the Eighth Circuit clearly said in that decision that the construction of the contract was driven by its interpretation of the statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.632" offset="2405798">Yes, I remember that from TWA 1, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.151" offset="2415829">But I didn't read the Eighth Circuit's opinion in this case as putting that much emphasis on the contract.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="576.037" offset="2443414">I misunderstood the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.256" offset="2448326">I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.756" offset="2454281">The Eighth Circuit, however, relied upon the survival of the Union Security Clause, which was one result of its decision in TWA 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.599" offset="2509661">But the Respondent has now disavowed that ground for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.985" offset="2527215">Respondent says in his brief that that's irrelevant, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.305" offset="2544456">The... as things stand, it appears that Congress left the resolution of whatever disputes remain after the stage of economic warfare to agreement by the parties, and here there was no back-to-work agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.487" offset="2645184">As this Court said in Burlington Northern, if the statute does not deal with the subject, it is for Congress, not for this Court, to establish rules to govern the exercise of self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.914" offset="2694921">On the other hand, if the Court discerns in some language of the RLA some intent by Congress to confer rights on strikers, in the absence of expressed language, legislative history or other guidelines, and in view of the different provisions in the two statutes, Congress cannot have intended those rights to be greater than the rights which the Court has held exist under the NLRA.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="984.279" offset="4076381">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="995.068" offset="4119535">Justice Kennedy, I'd like to begin by addressing the question that you were asking at the outset to my co-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.956" offset="4143046">The fact is that although the statute does plainly create a right in the crossovers to return to their job, a right that we think is fairly entailed by this Court's decision in Fleetwood and in the Board's decision in Laidlaw, that right, like many other rights, are waivable, and it is waivable by virtue of the union's duty to represent all employees, crossovers, full time strikers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.206" offset="4244087">The collective bargaining agreement is the form in which the waiver takes place, and if the waiver is articulated in that collective bargaining agreement, the crossovers have no claim, unless it's a claim against their union for a breach of their duty to represent all employees fairly and equitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.686" offset="4322037">But the mere fact that an agreement, a collective bargaining agreement can waive that right does not mean that there's no underlying right to be waived, and it's our position that indeed there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.792" offset="4366445">There's no inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.594" offset="4373654">I think this point is fairly implicit in this Court's decision in Belknap, and in particular footnote 8 of Belknap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.933" offset="4406987">And the Board has recognized in some of its decisions that this is a right that's waivable, and yet the right exists.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="1073.837" offset="4434572">Is it waivable only by contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1075.872" stopTime="1447.445">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="1075.872" offset="4442722">I believe that the only circumstances that I know of, or that the employer may displace the crossovers if he agrees to do so by collective bargaining agreement, or alternatively... and this is of course not this case... if the strike was an unfair labor practice strike, in which case the unfair labor practice strikers have a right of reinstatement and a right to bump the crossovers or the new... and the new hires, notwithstanding the Mackay decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.558" offset="4561527">We are here today on behalf of the Labor Board because the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, although this case arises under the Railway Labor Act, decided it under principles established by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.966" offset="4619101">Now, Respondents may well be correct to disown that basis for the decision, but assuming that the NLRA principles do apply, it is the Labor Board's view that the Court of Appeals applied that statute in an odd and untenable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.041" offset="4675421">In this Court's Mackay decision, and for 50 years since, two propositions have been firmly settled under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.945" offset="4707081">First, an employer is entitled to hire replacements for economics strikers and to offer them permanent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.301" offset="4740414">Second, the employer is not obligated to dismiss those replacements at the end of the strike by bumping them, as it were, in favor of strikers who wish to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.524" offset="4785344">Rather, as the Mackay case makes clear, an employer need only reinstate... and I'm quoting...</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.595" offset="4809690">"so many of the strikers as there were vacant places to be filled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.297" offset="4828394">In our view, the Court of Appeals misunderstood those principles by drawing a distinction for purposes of the Mackay rule, between so-called crossover employees and new hires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.022" offset="4875310">The Court of Appeals held that TWA could indeed lawfully replace the strikers with new hires, but that it could not do so in the case of the crossover employees, who in the Court's view had to be discharged to make room for the returning full-time strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.483" offset="4941139">We believe that distinction cannot be squared with the Mackay decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.220" offset="4960156">Certainly it finds no basis in the facts of Mackay, because in Mackay, after all, the strikers in that case were replaced by other company employees who were based in other company offices, at a time when the entire workforce of the company was supposed to be on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.599" offset="5029641">And it's fair to say, therefore, that Mackay itself dealt with crossovers, yet there's no intimation in this Court's opinion in Mackay that that fact made any difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.121" offset="5071751">Nor, we think, does the Court of Appeals' distinction find any basis in the purpose of the Mackay ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.541" offset="5097455">The Mackay rule, as the Court said in the decision, is based on the employer's</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.428" offset="5116995">"right to protect and continue his business by supplying places left vacant by strikers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.266" offset="5144371">That purpose, we suggest, does not justify drawing the distinction that the Court of Appeals drew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.820" offset="5170494">An employer may well need to draw on both sources of employees to run his business during an economic strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.192" offset="5204035">Indeed, in an industry like the airline industry, which is of course safety sensitive and effected with an important public purpose, it's rather odd to suppose that the employer is relegated only to replace the strikers with new hires... people who've never worked in the industry before, perhaps, instead of making use of the experienced pre-strike workers who either stayed on the job or returned early.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.093" offset="5303614">Now, the Court of Appeals based its decision not on these principles, but on a notion of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.063" offset="5331512">It viewed the decision of TWA as in effect a discrimination on the basis of union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.384" offset="5356799">That thesis, we believe, makes no sense once you recognize that Mackay itself involved the same kind of discrimination... a discrimination in favor of new hires who were replacing the full-term strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.893" offset="5410820">And it's impossible to see how the Court of Appeals decision would not equally apply to the decision to replace the full-term strikers with new hires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.916" offset="5446974">So, too, in that case, could it be said that that is a discrimination on the basis of union activity, but no one, not the Respondents nor the Court of Appeals is pressing that proposition on this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.057" offset="5491486">The Court of Appeals anchored its decision in Erie Resistor, but we believe the analogy cannot hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.426" offset="5513011">There, unlike here, the employer chose a novel and rather extreme form of, in a sense a punishment, by awarding 20 years' of super-seniority, which worked against all strikers, not just those who were replaced and had a long term effect on the workforce, both before and after the strike was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.291" offset="5600469">What's more, the Court of Appeals' decision has the anomalous consequence, we believe, of treating crossover employees who may have many years on the job, more unfavorably than new hires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.515" offset="5645295">The new hires, the Court of Appeals concluded, were entitled to permanent status... the crossovers were not, despite the many years they may have had on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.288" offset="5680404">We can find no basis in the Mackay decision for that kind of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.323" offset="5700570">Indeed, the crossovers have a claim that the new hires do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.227" offset="5716139">They have a claim of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.977" offset="5723140">They were permanent employees before the strike, they are permanent employees after the strike, and as we read the Fleetwood decision and the Laidlaw decision of the Board which followed on this Court's Fleetwood decision, it would have in fact been an unfair labor practice for the employer to have denied the crossover employees their jobs back, to have deprived them of full-term status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.426" offset="5808926">And the Court of Appeals' construction of the NLRA, assuming it is indeed applicable here, has the curious feature of requiring the employer to violate the law in order to avoid this discrimination that is alleged to persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.984" offset="5867232">We think it makes no sense to turn the statute so inside-out as to reach a result of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.340" offset="5892623">In short, we believe, there is simply no warrant under the NLRA for ousting the crossovers from the permanent positions that they had always enjoyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.195" offset="6548087">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.384" offset="6580792">I'd first like to try to set a couple of things straight, based on what I heard on the other side here this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.073" offset="6619558">First of all, we are not attempting to claim that under the RLA, the right to strike should have a greater protection than it does under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.349" offset="6680685">We are... neither are we necessarily disowning, as the Solicitor General put it, NLRA precedent that the Eighth Circuit utilized in its decision in finding that TWA violated the RLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.080" offset="6755604">For, as this Court knows, NLRA precedent, especially in an area where under the RLA case authority has not sufficiently developed, can be quite useful, can be conceptually useful as long as careful analogies are drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.291" offset="6836374">And I think it bears repeating that the NLRA precedent utilized by the lower court, in our opinion, was right on point, especially the case of Erie Resistor and the parallels that the lower court drew from this Court's decision in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.407" offset="6928848">Now, having said that, we readily acknowledge that the RLA does not contain express limitations in the Act concerning the parties' use of self-help measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.701" offset="6998020">But this Court has held that the parties' use of self-help is not totally unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.855" offset="7026650">As a matter of fact, in the Jacksonville Terminal decision, this Court held that while the parties may utilize the full measure of peaceful economic action as self-help, it cannot do os if that self-help conflicts with any other statutory obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.910" offset="7150889">I was talking about Jacksonville Terminal, as far as the Court's holding that as long as the self-help measures do not conflict with any other statutory obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.817" offset="7202507">Florida East Coast I will later visit, but I misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.621" offset="7221733">Now, one of these statutory obligations, we maintain, and apparently we have a very fundamental disagreement with counsel for TWA... one of these statutory obligations, we maintain, is the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.398" offset="7284845">It is protected under the RLA, and under section 2 Fourth this Court again, in Jacksonville Terminal, made it quite clear that the employees' right to strike is a core RLA right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.474" offset="7345135">It is integral to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.009" offset="7355271">In fact, other courts have described the right to strike in an RLA context as it has in the NLRA... one of the union's more cherished weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.817" offset="7398530">So, we maintain that there can be no question of the obligation under section 2 Fourth on the part of a carrier to avoid influencing or coercing the employees' right to strike through the use of self-help measures.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="2239.556" offset="9097534">Well, because, to put the shoe on the other foot, if the employer is also telling those who want to exercise fully their right to strike that they will most likely not only be replaced by permanent, new hire replacements, but also by early returning strikers because they chose to show fealty to the company at an earlier point, that they will not be allowed to keep their jobs, is blatant discrimination for engaging in union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.873" offset="9206726">And so this balancing has to occur, and we argue in this case that the violation is because TWA did not use a neutral basis in determining, in distributing the post-strike active workforce jobs, beyond those in which permanent new hire replacements were in, and could not be displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.822" offset="9302543">And we argue that seniority as the lower court used, was the most appropriate neutral basis that they could have utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.796" offset="9342458">TWA did not do so, and indeed trumpeted the fact even before the strike began that they were not going to use any neutral basis, or continue to use the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.687" offset="9390001">They announced early that they were going to use a system that would favor the early abandonment of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.674" offset="9418004">If you did not go in and get your job early, you might risk the chance of losing it for engaging in the strike full-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.447" offset="9453008">So, we really feel that the real question here is not whether this activity, this conduct on the part of TWA is coercive, as we clearly think it is, but whether there is any reason that this type of coercion should be somehow privileged under the RLA as the hiring of new hire replacements under the Mackay rule would appear to be under the RLA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.844" offset="13278588">"I'm sorry, there are no vacancies, and we can't reinstate you until there are some? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.046" offset="13295411">To the union, that is a circular argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.600" offset="13313697">It is begging the essential question, namely, whether or not the employer can make the initial promise that he seeks to keep at the end of the strike, the initial promise that these crossovers can remain in the post-strike workforce no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.145" offset="13391855">No matter seniority or any other neutral basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.716" offset="13410141">We feel that this is a result-oriented argument and should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.036" offset="13431352">Even if an employer does not, in fact, make promise of permanency to either new hires or crossovers, especially with respect to crossovers, then the law is clear that he cannot refuse to reinstate full-term strikers at that point, at the end of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.330" offset="13504600">He has to make the promise of permanency to the new hires to create the legitimate substantial business purpose that Fleetwood recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.480" offset="13617135">The question is not a question of promise of permanent employment, it was a promise that the company would not enter into an agreement waiving the rights which these people had with the union.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="3397.914" offset="13730925">--is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.666" offset="13737926">As Mr. Hurley said, seniority is a creature of collective bargaining agreement, and normally what happens after a strike is that you have a collective bargaining agreement known as a back-to-work agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.474" offset="13789126">There was no such back-to-work agreement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.759" offset="13798321">The District Court found that the original contract, whether it expired or not doesn't matter, did not contain this seniority right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.662" offset="13829877">Seniority is not something which is a neutral principle, as Mr. Hurley says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.650" offset="13849834">Seniority is something that unions fight for, and if they get it in a contract, the contract specifies what it can be used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.022" offset="13883375">There's nothing in the contract that says that you can use seniority to come back from a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.458" offset="13901139">The seniority analysis is completely false in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.612" offset="13921723">What these people did, the crossovers did, was to take the vacancies that existed during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.234" offset="13952234">They took the jobs, and there was no question of a reassignment or realignment of jobs after the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.621" offset="13981700">There was no need to assess a pool of applicants, and determine on what basis to give them or not give them jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.797" offset="14038438">The strikers who remained out by their own choice for the full term of the strike had lost their jobs because their jobs were filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.570" offset="14077517">If... there is no question, for example, that if the Court should announce such a rule as the union is arguing for, then perhaps in the next strike the crossover, the man who wants to exercise... or woman... who wants to exercise his right not to strike will simply resign his job and come back to work as a new hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.102" offset="14167692">Now, that is something that Laidlaw says is an unfair labor practice, to force a crossover to come back as a temporary employee or to give up his seniority rights when he comes back, and yet that's what the union says has to happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.647" offset="14237805">Anybody who wants not to strike must give up his seniority rights and all that he's earned during the time that he's been employed, and come back as a new employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.372" offset="14280750">Then he's unassailable... then the union can't use their so-called seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.525" offset="14305410">They can't use it anyhow, because it doesn't apply in this situation, and there is no discrimination analysis applicable either, because as this Court has said, in Mackay, with respect to new hires, discrimination does not apply.</text>
