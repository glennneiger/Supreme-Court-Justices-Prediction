            <text syncTime="739.315" offset="3101226">In the hearings held with respect to these regulations, or what culminated in these regulations, the FRA found that alcohol and drug impairment had contributed to a number of accidents and fatalities.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.167" offset="3220658">They further noted that these figures were likely to be understated due to what they identified as a conspiracy of silence resulting from the fear of employees to come forward on account of their concern about tort liability or the loss of the job if accurate reporting was forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.181" offset="3304772">All of this existed... these conditions and these difficulties... despite the existence for decades of operating Rule G referred to before which literally prohibits employees from using, possessing or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty and subjecting them to dismissal for violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.699" offset="5162809">In the normal criminal investigation case, both probable cause and a warrant are generally necessary to render a search reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.889" offset="5199590">In certain criminal and most non-criminal cases, neither is required or has been required by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.697" offset="5238773">And we would urge the same finding on this Court; that is, this is not a case where probable cause or a warrant are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.434" offset="5269702">This Court in determining the reasonableness of searches and seizures has adopted a balancing test which requires balancing the intrusion of the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.610" offset="5330411">The court of appeals did not apply such a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.530" offset="5350160">It found instead that the procedures set forth in the regulations were deficient because they failed to require a particularized suspicion as a trigger for the testing procedures offering the observation... and I quote... that</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.603" offset="5494460">The circuit court reached this conclusion because of its mistaken premise that finding a search justified at its inception requires a determination that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up the evidence sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.797" offset="5551198">The court, in short, failed to undertake the balancing test because it presumed the need for a particularized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.553" offset="5590173">This Court has stated that the Fourth Amendment protects only an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to considerable reasonable and that what is reasonable depends upon the context within which such a search takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.395" offset="5645552">I would like to move to that resolution of those balancing questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.066" offset="5668227">New Jersey v. T.L.O. emphasizes that exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion relied upon by the Ninth Circuit may be made... and I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.033" offset="5776164">In applying this test here, first, it's readily apparent that the search authorized by the regulations at issue manifestly takes place in an atmosphere of diminished expectations of the privacy of the employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.187" offset="6100710">And in so doing, in looking at the expectation of privacy that is forthcoming on the part of the individual employee, must look at the characteristics of the employment relationship and of the history of the regulation of that relationship, not just the industry, but of that relationship, for whose ever benefit that may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.201" offset="6188795">The other safeguards in the test from T.L.O. that are available is that the testing is not of a random kind or is it subject to the discretion of supervisors who might target or harass particular employees, but is triggered by objective events and, in the case of Subpart C, is required of all covered employees involved in the incident in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.549" offset="6282209">The testing must take place as soon as possible at an independent medical facility by qualified medical personnel.</text>
