            <text syncTime="71.348" offset="428744">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.629" offset="445880">This case poses a question of whether a tax assessor in Webster County, West Virginia can adopt and apply the so-called welcome stranger doctrine to Petitioner taxpayers in a way that results in discriminatory taxes on their properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.760" offset="530412">The welcome stranger doctrine favors long term residents of the county by leaving the valuations on their properties essentially as they have traditionally been, as they have been on the rolls, with only sporadic and de minimis increases, while valuing the properties of new purchasers at the prices they pay for similar properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.328" offset="632603">As shown in this case, the result is very dramatic disparities between the taxes paid on comparable pieces of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.401" offset="664891">Now, I don't think I need to review in any detail here with you the facts relating to the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.383" offset="688819">Let me just say in a paragraph that in 1974 Allegheny Pittsburgh bought 7306 acres of land in Webster County which it sold to East Kentucky Energy in 1982, and in 1977, the Shamrock/Oneida property in Webster County was purchased, consisting of 7783 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.466" offset="789233">Applying the welcome stranger doctrine to these sales, the assessor revised the appraisals on each of the two sets of properties to conform to the statement of declaration in each deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.570" offset="853599">In each deed you must state what the price is, and their, their assessments were conformed accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.896" offset="886931">The assessor, however, did not revalue or reappraise any adjoining or comparable properties either then or at any--</text>

            <text syncTime="194.846" offset="922667">Well, Mr. Prettyman, are you suggesting that if there's a sale of a piece of property, the assessor has to go in and revalue all the adjoining property right then?</text>

            <text syncTime="261.179" offset="1188071">What we say is that on any kind of a regular basis we would... whatever the circumstances are in the state... in some states it's every year, in some states it's every other year, and in some states it's every third or fourth year, but at least if there is a good faith attempt by the assessor to keep up with current market value, if that's the standard that they're going to use, then there cannot be the disparities that show up in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.058" offset="1307607">But you've got to remember now that she didn't even attempt this.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.291" offset="1320460">This is not a case where she was lagging behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.040" offset="1331535">She didn't attempt in any way to revalue the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.655" offset="1449922">Well, Your Honor, it doesn't make any difference whether that's true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.904" offset="1462984">I take issue with it simply because the circuit court found that that in fact did not happen, and the circuit court was looking at the actual records of how properties were treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.464" offset="1501227">He found, for example, that some properties were raised $10 and not 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.744" offset="1522334">He found that 35 percent of the properties weren't raised at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.445" offset="1537067">But even if you take 10 percent, even if you say that in the three years that she purported to do this, which was in '76, '81 and '83, even if she did that, you get nowhere near the evaluations that you're talking about for our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.297" offset="1612509">Moreover, that's not a re-evaluation of the property on the basis of current market value, which is what she did to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.981" offset="1643229">Rather, that's just simply an arbitrary 10 percent raise every few years, and the disparity remains; the disparity remains, because we're talking about disparities in our case are from 32 to 35 times, not percent, in regard to East Kentucky and Allegheny Pittsburgh, and 8 to 20 times the value in regard to Shamrock and Oneida.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.182" offset="11004051">But it's important to know, Your Honor, that even if this land was grossly misvalued the actions that are being challenged here are the failure of the assessor and the Board of Equalization and Review to raise their, their valuations from the presumed accurate ones that they had initially made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.216" offset="11112198">The West Virginia Supreme Court pointed out that that's actually what's being challenged here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.209" offset="11196208">The circuit court simply said that having done that, the circuit court found it was a violation of equal protection not to raise the rest, or not to explain why the failure to do so would have been... was not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.861" offset="11250752">So what we're really testing here is an actions of an assessor and the actions of a Board of Review in failing to believe the evidence that convinced the circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.042" offset="11311460">The assessor and the Board of Review heard the allegations, the complaints of the Petitioners, but knowing the nature of the region, knowing the nature of coal properties, knowing their duties under statute, did not think that they were on sufficient notice that they were deprived of a reasonable conclusion that the properties... that they should stick with the presumptions, and unless they have sufficient evidence to convince themselves in an honest way that the other people's properties have increased in value then, according to West Virginia law, they won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.309" offset="11448551">And if their actions were neither an intentional, deliberate discrimination against particular groups, if there was a reasonable, nonarbitrary decision by the assessors and the Board of Equalization Review to use certain policies as indicated by the government, and if these behaviors are part and parcel of a statutory scheme that results in unequal valuations, that's not a violation of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.060" offset="11595568">That would be, in fact, a state discrimination, a state classification of techniques that in some circumstances, or even predictably, would lead to differences in valuation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.589" offset="13381717">It's... the court said the only issue left for us to decide is whether there was an intentional and systematic undervaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.539" offset="13409511">Those were the words of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.258" offset="13416407">Intentional and systematic undervaluation, if proven, is not necessarily a violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.974" offset="13443261">The constitutional standard really is intentional and arbitrary discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.861" offset="13466771">So the court made a finding that the allegations below were not there, systematic and intentional undervaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.295" offset="13508463">All three are definable and provable without reference to any legal standard, and the intentional and systematic discrimination, therefore, is a conclusion that must logically follow from that decision, and from that, of course, no violation of equal protection or a violation of the Constitution of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.939" offset="13623088">Your Honor, I would like to point out in closing that this Court should think, but what would happen if in fact Petitioners prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.232" offset="13664257">What it would be in danger of doing is creating a kind of an exclusionary rule that would benefit large investors, large mineral property owners that could buy properties and after making expensive explorations which are a prerequisite to their knowing it's worth it, and rest assured that because others won't be able to make that determination, they are not going to have to carry their fair tax burden unless the county goes out and does some exotic, complicated, expensive exploration and survive this exclusionary rule because the evidence won't have to come in against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.151" offset="13835934">I think that the Court should be aware of the fact that not merely Webster County will be subjected to tremendous, had its primary source of revenue--</text>

            <text syncTime="3649.493" offset="14741338">Back at the time when they had sort of a moving evaluation, in Killen, which is in the briefs, the West Virginia Supreme Court said equal and uniform taxation cannot result when each county assessor can vary assessments up to 50 percent of the appraised value both within and among classes of property, declared it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.359" offset="14832766">In regard to the intimation here that no comparability findings were made, the circuit court made ten comparability findings, and I will cite you specifically to six, just to 16a, 24a, 72a and 74a out of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.586" offset="14905700">A point was made about the stipulation being, referring only to geologically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.865" offset="14926807">It also said, Exhibit B, the comparables, accurately reflects the increase to neighboring comparable properties both as to assessment per acre and percentage increase for the period '75 through '74.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.515" offset="14989397">And also, the circuit court not only was banking on geological, which was the whole point... after all, we're talking about coal... but also had maps and, huge maps here showing where these properties were and so forth, they were adjoining, they were contiguous, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.258" offset="15060345">And finally, let me just say that please remand this case in a way where we get something out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.475" offset="15089184">You've been confronted with several cases recently where the Petitioners went back and thought they'd won, and they got nothing.</text>
