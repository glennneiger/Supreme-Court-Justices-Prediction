            <text syncTime="23.645" offset="223086">The Blanchard police brutality case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.141" offset="245029">The first is whether a contingent fee contract forms a cap on section 1988 reasonable fees, and the second is whether paraprofessional time should be included within the auspices of section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.282" offset="321620">I came to this case after it had already been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.396" offset="342100">A fellow attorney became ill and asked me to take it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.829" offset="359759">I reviewed it, decided that it had merit, and after that asked him what sort of fee arrangement he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.174" offset="393196">He told me he had a 40 percent contingent fee contract with Mr. Blanchard, but that if I won, or the case was won, there would be fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.133" offset="501029">For example, I would say 99 percent of all negligence cases that are taken in the United States are taken when the client comes in, a contingent fee contract is accepted on that sort of basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.592" offset="566858">But section 1988 applies to the end of the case, and is not a relationship with the client, it is the implementation of fees against a losing party who has violated a civil rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.803" offset="943648">I do not think that it is, it is a relevant factor, because it is the private agreement between a client and an attorney, whereas the implementation of 1988 comes at the end after all of the work has been done and Congress, the Intent of Congress, as I understand it from the cases, are that this is part of the vindication of the civil right.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.233" offset="1117414">I think then you may get into the possibility of consideration of windfall, but I don't think that's... I think it's a consideration but I think the reasonable fee as instituted, as required by 1988, is the primary consideration, and that primary consideration is Loadstar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.370" offset="10193921">I think that the court can award paralegal time in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.064" offset="10216699">The case presented before this Court is that the... rather the decision of the Fifth Circuit is that the paralegal award is included within the contingency fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.424" offset="10270198">The District Court in this very case found that paralegal and law clerk time was not necessary, that the simplicity of this case prevented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.557" offset="10306665">So whether or not paralegal time, it may be recoverable under different circumstances is something that is not before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.286" offset="10349610">Certainly if there was evidence presented at the trial that the cost of paralegals and law clerks is paid or billed to clients in that particular marketplace as an addition to the fee charged by the attorney, then I would say yes, it would be recoverable under 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.899" offset="10436023">Any recovery of fees in excess of the amount contracted, including paralegal and law clerk time, would provide a windfall to the Plaintiff's attorney, in derogation of Congress' purpose in passing the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.093" offset="10512823">The Fifth Circuit decision should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.784" offset="10523586">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="2603.706" offset="10543334">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.089" offset="10552843">Let me try to put to rest the windfall argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.352" offset="10565904">If 1988 is correctly applied it cannot be a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.046" offset="10588683">They are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.327" offset="10597774">You can't have a reasonable fee which is a windfall, at least as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.109" offset="10620866">On the issue of what effect does the contingent fee contract have, the contingent fee amount in a contract may in fact be a reasonable fee, so that a court must look, may want to look at the contract, and the amount recovered, and may say that this is reasonable, and therefore one becomes the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.036" offset="10720654">But I suggest to the Court that it may not be reasonable, and it may be too, it may be too little or it may be too less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.863" offset="10759942">And that is where 1988 comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.385" offset="10774048">The fee itself belongs to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.067" offset="10788781">There's a 1934 Louisiana Supreme Court case on it, it was used in a 1982 Louisiana appellate case, in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.375" offset="10833921">As to the allegations that this, we all knew that an on-duty police officer broke my client's jaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.852" offset="10875925">The fact of the matter is that that wasn't known for some... the allegations were in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.885" offset="10900063">The question was, at the very beginning, whether this happened in a... he was in a bar room, he was not in a condition to know exactly who it was who hit him, as I understand it, at the very beginning, and therefore without some investigation that then led to the allegations that it did turn out in fact to be the on-duty, police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.804" offset="11011658">As to the simplicity of the case, this is a case against basically the only law officer in this part of a rural Louisiana parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.765" offset="11071530">There was substantial fear that I found in contacting potential witnesses against testifying against this police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.061" offset="11116670">I was faced by two very competent counsel, one for the bar and Mr. Guidry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.285" offset="11145614">And this is not, I don't believe there's any civil rights case which are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.169" offset="11173199">I use for the benefit of myself and my client, and in the long run for the benefit, as it turned out, for the Defendant the use of paralegals and law clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.299" offset="11229623">Their time is compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.582" offset="11238819">That is the system of keeping legal costs to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.544" offset="11266613">They were very important in this case, and their time and their services should be compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.300" offset="11293676">And they should be compensated, I suggest--</text>
