            <text syncTime="6.820" offset="162230">Mr. Fairey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Gaston Fairey</label>
            <text syncTime="49.414" offset="332548">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="341012">The issue before this Court today deals with a Geders type deprivation of counsel during an afternoon, 15 minute recess in the middle of a defendant's... at the end of his direct examination, prior to his cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.775" offset="402034">The Petitioner's position is that this should be subjected to a per se prejudice test in circumstances where five basic criteria are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.100" offset="447278">This Court has traditionally recognized that denial of counsel during the course of a trial is an error that, because of its nature, deals with fundamental fairness in the criminal process of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="500986">We think we have identified basically five criteria that should be used to determine whether or not basically the defendant has been prejudiced by an order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.132" offset="543409">Those criteria are basically, first, that a trial judge issue an order depriving access of a criminal defendant and his attorney; second, that this happened during a critical stage of the criminal process; third, that it happened at a time when the defendant and his lawyer would normally consult, and that there is a need for the consultation; fourth, that but for the order of the court, the consultation would have taken place; and fifth, that the consultation does not interfere with the orderly process of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="689903">Now, this Court in Geders, some time ago, found that it is a violation of the Sixth Amendment to deprive access to a criminal defendant his counsel during a break.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.564" offset="741208">Admittedly, that break was an overnight recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.218" offset="763778">The break at issue here is not an overnight recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.634" offset="765449">It is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="157.717" stopTime="173.910">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="157.717" offset="765763">Mr. Fairey, you wouldn't go so far as to give the, give them a right to interrupt the testimony to say, by counsel, and say that I want to speak to my client and advise him?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_gaston_fairey" startTime="173.910" stopTime="213.019">
            <label>Mr. W. Gaston Fairey</label>
            <text syncTime="173.910" offset="830547">--Not a per se right, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.012" offset="838906">I think that should be left to the discretion of the trial judge as to whether it interferes with the normal trial process, and also, depending upon the reason the interruption is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.367" offset="876418">Again, if... it goes back to these five factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.736" offset="889897">If there's something that has occurred during the course of the trial that a court would recognize as essential to the attorney-client relationship, let's say a witness, even a normal witness, not even a defendant, if they have a question as to whether or not an answer would incriminate them, would have the right to consult with an attorney before answering the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.281" offset="960009">If that situation came up with a criminal defendant, obviously they have no less of a Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.102" offset="979340">Again, it would be--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="213.019" offset="986968">What if a defendant at the close of cross examine... defendant takes the stand, cross examination by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.505" offset="1012881">At the close of that cross examination, before re-examination by the defense, the defense attorney says I want to consult with my client before I go into rebuttal?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.085" offset="1091249">Well, supposing the trial court says in effect just what the trial court here said, that you're not entitled to discuss with your client anytime you want to during court proceedings these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.727" offset="1133776">This is not a recess, and so you can't do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.342" offset="1232310">Well, the essential difference in a situation such as that and the case here is there is no denial of right to counsel where the counsel and the defendant are in the same courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.631" offset="1273479">They are available to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.900" offset="1278494">The court is there as an intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.102" offset="1287271">This Court has recognized that there are occasions when the Sixth Amendment right may be subjected to the court's right to conduct the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.838" offset="1318305">That's the basic test for any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.742" offset="1337845">And so the issue, I think that, Mr. Chief Justice, you're bringing up, that is where the balancing test comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.313" offset="1364176">Where the balancing test does not come--</text>

            <text syncTime="392.502" offset="1704917">My problem is I don't think that that is a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.637" offset="1721427">I think that is within the trial court's discretion, but that is an entirely different situation than what is present here.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Gaston Fairey</label>
            <text syncTime="416.384" offset="1800421">--But there's a difference because time doesn't stand still when the court takes a break.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.188" offset="1819647">We have a defendant, and I think maybe the facts of this case are particularly important here because we have a defendant that has been described by the state's doctors as childlike, who has low intelligence, who has been emotionally ill, who has been committed to a state hospital for a period of about two and a half months, who has suffered from amnesia and a hysterical reaction, who is being, after being treated and gotten to competency, taken to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.304" offset="1916091">His basic childlike nature has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.756" offset="1929884">He is still a man in child's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.958" offset="1942736">When he is faced with a situation of being taken out of the courtroom and placed in a very small room with no window and no other person, just one chair, enclosed in about a six by six room, with no one to talk to, it cannot help but affect his performance later on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.519" offset="2012953">Additionally, the other side is not placed in this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.037" offset="2027059">The other side is a trained advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.489" offset="2036881">They now have 15 minutes to prepare a cross examination based upon what they have just heard on a very lengthy direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.695" offset="2069691">It's not an even trade here.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.695" offset="2077737">In effect, this fortuity of this break aids the state and penalizes the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.951" offset="2102710">And for this reason, as a trial lawyer, if you give me the opportunity before any witness to take 15 minutes after they've been on direct, I'm in a much better position to conduct my cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.108" offset="2151298">The test I am suggesting for this Court avoids this problem because basically when this Court tells trial judges the Sixth Amendment right is absolute, if you do it under these circumstances you will have trouble.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.096" offset="2283268">The test that my client is advocating that should be applied as to whether or not per se analysis should apply to situations like this, primarily I think the fourth criteria is the one that should be determinative of whether the per se rule applies if the other four are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.310" offset="2364143">The other four are fairly easy to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.060" offset="2371144">If it's during a break, obviously it doesn't interfere with the trial day.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.428" offset="2384623">The trial judge obviously would have to make some type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.011" offset="2394968">Obviously the client and the attorney would have to at least attempt to confer or notify the court they wanted to confer, and obviously it would have to be during some critical stage of the trial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.694" offset="8145668">In this case there were, admittedly, numerous recesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.646" offset="8161446">There was a recess, in fact, during the direct examination of Mr. Perry when the access to his client was not restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.050" offset="8191121">There was also the luncheon recess that occurred just prior to Mr. Perry taking the witness stand, and at the conclusion of his testimony became the overnight recess, that he had the opportunity to consult, and he he did not chose to present Mr. Perry once again for examination before the court if he had an adequate showing or an adequate need to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.220" offset="8415774">At the conclusion of the trial, after the verdict was entered, a proffer was made through the court by Mr. Perry that the matters they wanted to discuss with him during that brief recess was his rights on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.646" offset="8473453">There was no contention, and there was no contention here that he had failed to previously explain those rights to cross examination to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.537" offset="8513054">It's clear from a review of this particular cross examination that Mr. Perry had took full advantage of that cross and had placed his story and his version of the events before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.095" offset="8563314">Unlike the childlike position that he is seeking to present before this Court, Mr. Perry certainly was not a passive witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.200" offset="8595706">He was able to resist efforts by the solicitor to color his story as it was presented about certain versions of where he was, and he was able to tell his own version of the particular events in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.608" offset="8645338">He denied going to the victim's apartment complex when that issue was raised about the location of the automobile and where her apartment complex was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.531" offset="8685045">He denied even knowing where that complex was, and essentially stated he had never been there in his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.535" offset="8705002">He corrected the prosecution about who had possession of the particular gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.172" offset="8727572">He was able to answer cogently and directly to those questions by the solicitor rather than a yes/no question to those very strong and serious questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.361" offset="8768323">And he was able, clearly, from a review of the record, to fully explain his answers on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.633" offset="8797476">The evidence of guilt in this case certainly was overwhelming if you look at the entire record.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Gaston Fairey</label>
            <text syncTime="2609.100" offset="10571294">Yes, sir, I believe it does because I think the right to counsel is much more than just a legal aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.671" offset="10589580">You are the advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.571" offset="10597208">That's why we call then counsellors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.806" offset="10602119">We don't call them necessarily just attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.823" offset="10610165">We aid the client much more than just Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.194" offset="10631689">We help them know how to try a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.896" offset="10642452">I teach trial lawyers how to try cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.348" offset="10652274">A big part of what we teach is, is humanizing that client and getting to know that client, and getting that client to trust you so that he will turn to you, seek your advice, and trust you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.953" offset="10690726">If we start depriving access of the criminal defendant to that one friend in the courtroom, we are destroying the concept of this attorney-client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.177" offset="10735657">I think it is much more important than just you are the mouthpiece in the courtroom, and there I think is where the extremity, the real prejudice in this situation comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.069" offset="10779229">But it is much more, it is prejudice to the concept that we have recognized that, since Hamilton, that you don't deny a criminal defendant access to his counsel without a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.959" offset="10826772">And we have found it is not a good reason that they may talk about upcoming cross examination, particularly when there's no fear that you're going to improperly talk about it, only that you're going to discuss the rules of cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.100" offset="10875255">There's no reason to deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.219" offset="10887794">There is every reason in the world to discourage this type of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.838" offset="10906289">I would point out to the Court that the dissent in the Fourth Circuit I think raised a good point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.908" offset="10922589">This was not a case of overwhelming evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.842" offset="10930321">The jury was out two full days and almost hung up on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.127" offset="10947458">There was a substantial duress defense presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.912" offset="10958534">There was forensic evidence introduced... and I'm sorry, I have finished my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.364" offset="10976401">Thank you.</text>
