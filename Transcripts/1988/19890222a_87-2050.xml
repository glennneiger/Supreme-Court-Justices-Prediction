            <text syncTime="14.424" offset="205398">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.857" offset="211145">Five years ago this Court decided a case called Lynch against Donnelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.411" offset="229327">In that case the Court upheld a Christmas display in Pawtucket, Rhode Island against a First Amendment challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.398" offset="257225">The display contained a rather large nativity scene with figures as big as five-feet tall.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.802" offset="286900">The City of Pawtucket owned the display, erected it, and maintained it each year as part of a display in the vicinity of the City Hall and a private park near the downtown shopping center.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="47.395" offset="337264">So, it was on private property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="49.678" stopTime="130.596">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="49.678" offset="346355">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.847" offset="351057">The mayor himself participated in the lighting of the display each year, and a ceremony to which people were invited... the public was invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.821" offset="402989">And the city's involvement in the display was never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.356" offset="417095">Indeed, that was the reason that the case came before this Court in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.475" offset="437575">Had there been no city involvement, of course, there would have been no constitutional issue presented in Lynch at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.629" offset="454189">The Court rejected the Establishment Clause challenge in Lynch and held that the display did not compel or seek to compel adherence to any religious belief and did not violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.138" offset="512180">The way in which the Court put the issue to be decided in Lynch is significant for today's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.744" offset="546662">The Court said that the issue for decision in Lynch was whether the Establishment Clause prohibits a municipality from including a creche or nativity scene in its annual Christmas display.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.052" offset="591906">That is how the Court began its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.170" offset="604340">In the five years since Lynch was decided, three federal courts of appeals have considered Establishment Clause challenges to Christmas displays in various cities around the country, including Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Birmingham, Michigan.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="130.596" offset="670064">And we had a Scarsdale, New York case.</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="133.881" stopTime="200.991">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>

            <text syncTime="135.083" offset="688037">That was affirmed by an equally divided court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.067" offset="695978">And, in any event, the Scarsdale case was slightly different, as you may remember, because it involved a request by a group to put a display in a park.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.391" offset="737251">It was not a city display that was challenged after it was erected, as was the case in the Chicago case, the Birmingham case, and the case that's here today, the Pittsburgh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.831" offset="778943">This case is here on certiorari to the Third Circuit and it involves displays in the Allegheny County Courthouse and in the City-County Building which is directly across the street from the Allegheny County Courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.043" offset="851877">The Allegheny County Courthouse display consists of a nativity scene which is surrounded by Christmas trees, poinsettia plants, wreaths on the windows behind the staircase, and is used as the site for a choral program that takes place throughout the Christmas season each year.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.908" offset="1055318">Well, that's a matter of dispute in the case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.260" offset="1072664">As I read the Court's opinion, the Court did not very heavily stress the additional items that were included in a display.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.022" offset="1143717">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.341" offset="1149046">The... the staircase on which the nativity scene was displayed in this case was decorated with Christmas trees, poinsettia plants and wreaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.380" offset="1189170">There were other decorations elsewhere in the building, not immediately on the staircase.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.850" offset="1207038">The staircase was also used as the site for the choir programs that took place every day during the Christmas season during the noon hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.456" offset="1241519">In addition, the bottom of the staircase, which is on the second floor of the county courthouse, opens into an area called the Gallery/Forum area which the Court can see in the pictures that are reproduced in the joint exhibit volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.514" offset="1297735">That Gallery/Forum area is an area that's used to display a variety of artwork throughout the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.370" offset="1325111">It's not any kind of an integral part of the Christmas display.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.905" offset="1343292">In any event, as far as we are concerned, the opinion in Lynch does not stress the additional secular elements in the Christmas display.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.831" offset="1395015">They are listed at the beginning of the Court's opinion, but very little, if any, of the Court's opinion puts any emphasis on them as a key factor in the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.937" offset="1439423">What is a key factor in the Court's decision and what applies equally here is the context of the holiday season.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.959" offset="1467531">The nativity scene here, just like the nativity scene in Lynch, was not erected in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.564" offset="1501908">It was erected as part of a holiday celebration that was sponsored by the County of Allegheny and then the separate display on the City-County Building--</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="362.778" offset="1598770">Well, Your Honor, that question was raised during the oral argument in Lynch, and I think I'll answer it the same way as the Solicitor General answered it on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.467" offset="1633565">I think that probably tests the limit of the Court's decision in Lynch, but I would say that would be appropriate as long as it were a noncoercive ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.073" offset="1675988">That is, it did not involve any compulsion and it did not involve anything more than a de minimus expenditure of public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.977" offset="1703573">We think... our first submission to the Court about the legality of both the nativity scene and the other display is that they are passive displays.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.534" offset="1745787">The Court mentioned in Lynch twice that they were... that the display in that case was a passive symbol of the holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.973" offset="1775567">And we think that that in and of itself is ground for sustaining the displays in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.127" offset="1800226">I might add, just so that the facts are clear, the second display is in the front of the City-County Building.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.281" offset="1832827">It consists of a 45 foot Christmas tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.566" offset="1841918">There is an 18 foot menorah attached to the pillar next to the Christmas tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.887" offset="1863233">And there are... there is a sign from the mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, the text of which is reprinted in the briefs... talks about a salute to liberty and a reminder that the festive lights... that the festive lights remind us that we are the keepers of the flame of liberty and our legacy of freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.848" offset="1931047">Do you think the message conveyed by a display may be different when the symbol is located in a city hall or a courthouse instead of a park in a commercial district, a private park?</text>

            <text syncTime="460.608" offset="1990084">Your Honor, we don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.475" offset="1997607">At least, not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.977" offset="2003563">And the reason is that the city's involvement with the display in Lynch was absolutely clear as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.047" offset="2027805">That was how the case came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.916" offset="2035328">Moreover, at the very beginning of the Court's opinion in Lynch, the Court noted that the kind of display that the Court was addressing in Lynch was of the kind that was frequently displayed on public grounds throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.223" offset="2092589">And, in fact, I think there's a very strong argument that the display on the steps of the second floor of the county courthouse, a display which the record shows was not even seen by 90 to 95 percent of the people who enter the courthouse, is far less prominent and far less likely to convey any message of government approval than is the display in Pawtucket, which was erected and maintained by the city and which was illuminated by the city in a ceremony to which the public was invited.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.769" offset="2270744">I think the symbol itself is a passive device.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.204" offset="2280461">Now, there are cases that you may be aware of from the lower federal courts involving enormous crosses that were illuminated either on a hillside or the side of a very prominent building and that were found to be violations of the Establishment Clause because of the dominance of the symbol over the community and the inability to avoid the symbol and the fact that it looked as if the city were endorsing this as a symbol for the entire community.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.556" offset="2397908">That is far from the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.675" offset="2406371">As far as the passive-active dichotomy, I think my answer to your question is yes, they would be passive symbols.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.364" offset="2437091">We have outlined in our briefs that the evil that was addressed by the Establishment Clause initially was the evil of government coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.291" offset="2496860">Either government coercion of adherence to particular religious beliefs or government use of public funds to establish and support a church.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.112" offset="2520161">In the absence of those... of either of those things, we... I think we have to recognize that we're on the periphery of what the framers sought to address in the Establishment Clause in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.170" offset="2568331">Now, Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Lynch suggested a somewhat broader focus on the concept of endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.324" offset="2600931">And, of course, endorsement or the persuasive value of government action, doesn't necessarily involve coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.763" offset="2638757">If the mayor, for example, were to announce that he thought it would be a good idea if the city adopted Judaism as its official religion, that might not involve any coercion but it might nevertheless constitute the kind of endorsement that Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion suggested would be inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.130" offset="3884171">The irony of this case insofar as it applies to the menorah is that an apparently successful effort on the part of the City of Pittsburgh to demonstrate to its population neutrality with regard to all religions by displaying a symbol which is religious as well as nonreligious to the Jewish community is being attacked as violating the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.697" offset="3994407">The holiday season that is involved here is, of course, a season which is recognized throughout the United States, and throughout the world indeed, but principally because its focus is a day that has become a secular holiday but has very substantial religious overtones to the majority population in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.730" offset="4086567">It is not from the vantage point of the Jewish faith a time of a principal holiday that Jews celebrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.836" offset="4119064">It happens to be a time when there is also a minor Jewish festival, which is the Festival of Chanukah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.089" offset="4148007">And, therefore, to demonstrate to the citizens of Pittsburgh its respect for minority faiths, the city erected immediately adjacent to a very large Christmas tree... and we have a photograph at page 4 of our petition of the scene... a 45-foot high Christmas tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.819" offset="4234943">Immediately adjacent to that, an 18-foot high menorah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.938" offset="4247377">And we submit that, given the context, that is a perfectly appropriate and permissible educational effort on the part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.679" offset="4294398">This Court has said repeatedly ever since its opinion in Abington and Schempp that even actions, things that are not passive, but things such as bible readings, that are done for instructional purposes for religion generally are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.326" offset="4369003">And we submit that taken in proper context what this menorah does at... a time of a major Christian holiday is it advises the citizenry that there are other faiths that celebrate at that very same time--</text>
