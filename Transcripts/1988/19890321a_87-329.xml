            <text syncTime="8.866" offset="183210">Mr. Rahdert, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_k_rahdert" startTime="11.440" stopTime="191.537">
            <label>Mr. George K. Rahdert</label>
            <text syncTime="11.440" offset="193450">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.632" offset="206302">This case challenges the constitutionality of Florida statute 794.03, which imposes sanctions of a nature never sustained by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.466" offset="245590">794.03 is a content-based, categorical ban on the publication of the name of rape victims in the state of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.272" offset="280804">This statute imposes criminal and implied civil sanctions for the publication of true information as applied here for the publication of information obtained from the public domain, which was placed there by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.402" offset="341303">Several aspects of this statute bear particular mention at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.325" offset="361052">First, the statute applies solely to press publication and to the press's news sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.069" offset="384039">It does not reach gossip, or other non-media forms of communication of the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.694" offset="406505">Second, the statute imposes a blanket ban similar to the statutory approach, which this court, rejected in the Boston Globe v. Superior Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.500" offset="449764">The statute makes no exceptions for the circumstances of the crime, the investigation of the crime, the prosecution of the crime for the existence of prior publicity, for disclosures of the identity of victims in court, in open court, or for other information that is already in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.996" offset="535759">Significantly, the statute does not make exception for voluntary disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.868" offset="563239">By the strict terms of the statute, when Florida Senator Paula Hawkins spoke about personal experiences in this area, that was contrary to the statute, and the press reports were, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.187" offset="612454">It could even be applied to Harvard Law professor, Susan Estritch, writing for the Yale Law Journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.192" offset="640457">As written, the statute is a sanction on pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.787" offset="658848">An analysis applied to a very similar statute in Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.000" offset="679746">The sanction on pure speech is underscored by the determination of the Florida First District Court of Appeal, which ruled that the subject matter of my client's publication, newspaper publication, was not to be published as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.692" offset="754456">The statute as applied in this case imposes a civil cause of action, and imposes negligence, per se, for publishing, again, truthful information, obtained by routine news gathering processes, and obtained from the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.543" offset="829897">The implications arising from negligence, per se, are illustrated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.957" offset="847556">At trial, simply on the proof of publication, the trial judge directed a verdict on liability against the newspaper, and sent the case to the jury on damages, including punitive damages on an instruction of reckless indifference.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel D. Eaton</label>
            <text syncTime="1527.821" offset="6258978">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.705" offset="6282593">I want to divide my argument into, essentially, two parts, which you're free to interfere with, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.030" offset="6307879">But first, I think I need to distinguish Cox Broadcasting Corp v. Cohn, and after I have done that, I will turn to how the conflicting interest, privacy versus free press, ought to be balanced in our view, to resolve the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.830" offset="6367021">Before I reach either of those subject, however, I need to correct one thing that Mr. Rahdert said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.423" offset="6381440">He said that the evidence in this case does not reflect that the assailant had not been apprehended at the time of the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.037" offset="6407876">The article in question here contains as its last sentence, the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.851" offset="6431177">"Patrol efforts have been suspended concerning this incident, because of a lack of evidence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.205" offset="6448523">That article was in evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.187" offset="6460435">B.J.F. was asked at trial if that article was true, and she stated, "Unfortunately, it is true".</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.980" offset="6487706">So, the fact that the assailant was still at large at the time of the publication is proven on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.336" offset="6517068">When the gut issue here, privacy versus free press, came up to this court, it was presented in a somewhat attenuated form in the Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.843" offset="6571089">This court never reached the point where it had to balance those conflicting interests, however, because with the exception of the chief justice's dissent on the jurisdictional ground, the court unanimously concluded, that because the rape victim's name in the Cox Broadcasting case had already been placed freely into the public domain in connection with a judicial proceeding, and nobody had ever taken any steps to protect the confidentiality of that information, and, therefore, the victim had no reasonable expectation of privacy at that point, that the newspaper could not be punished criminally or civilly or simply repeating in public, what was already in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.360" offset="6737228">And because it reached that conclusion, it didn't have to go on to balance the respective interests involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.686" offset="6766485">To the extent that there's any balancing suggested by Cox Broadcasting, I need to remind the court, as well, that this is also a different factual case than Cox Broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.124" offset="6812252">In Cox Broadcasting, the victim was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.436" offset="6825522">Her mental and physical security did not need to be protected at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.969" offset="6843599">The plaintiff in Cox Broadcasting Corp., who was asserting a privacy right, was the victim's father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.532" offset="6865855">He was asserting his privacy right; not the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.575" offset="6882051">And the assailant had been apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.345" offset="6889156">And the matter had reached full-blown judicial trial of this assailant, at which point, a number of different considerations come into play that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.492" offset="6933669">Now, I argued below, and I have argued here, that the reason Cox Broadcasting does not control this case, is contrary to Mr. Rahdert's suggestion to the court, B.J.F.'s name was not in the "public domain" at the time the newspaper obtained the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.486" offset="7009633">Florida, perhaps in response to this court's decision in Cox Broadcasting Corp., enacted a statute called the Florida Public Records Act, which contains an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.403" offset="7049339">And it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.322" offset="7052996">"That the identity of a rape victim on any public record maintained by the state of Florida is exempt from public disclosure. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.518" offset="7085806">It is confidential.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.151" offset="7104301">I mean, something's in the public domain, if it's public knowledge as opposed to something classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.505" offset="7121750">That just means that the state won't release it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.785" offset="7134916">It doesn't take it out of the public domain, if the newspaper could go around and find out the name of that victim, independently, from a neighbor, or from somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.371" offset="7165218">I think you're confusing what's in the public domain, with what is in public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.476" offset="7189669">I think it's, it has to be conceded that this was not properly in public records, but that isn't synonymous with being in the public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.279" offset="7220807">Well, I'm not inclined to argue with you, Your Honor, except for the fact that the lower courts have declared as a matter of state law, that this exception from the Public Records Act, attach to the material, and not merely to the custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.379" offset="7277231">The argument below was that only the state has an obligation to follow this law, and the newspaper doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.464" offset="7305548">Now, the state courts rejected that, and in the short opinion which is before the court, it has characterized this police report, which was stumbled on by this reporter trainee as non-public information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.853" offset="7355181">And I think that conclusion is justifiable along the following line of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.136" offset="7384229">This report was not a press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.160" offset="7400425">Mr. Rahdert keeps calling it a press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.770" offset="7410769">It was a copy of a police report form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.572" offset="7422054">The very document protected by the confidentiality laws of the state of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.465" offset="7441594">One copy of that report was placed in a room labeled press room, by mistake, obviously, without redaction of B.J.F.'s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.292" offset="7480882">That report, so far as the record in this case reflects, was seen by no other person except the reporter trainee in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.628" offset="7510244">The reporter trainee testified at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.670" offset="7530410">"You understood you were not supposed to take down the information from the police department? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.754" offset="7546710">Answer, "Yes".</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.624" offset="7554234">If she had followed what she knew to be the law, and the policy of her own newspaper, it never would have gone any farther than a piece of paper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.313" offset="8104999">My argument is that the statute, which is a state law, which declares that piece of paper, and that name confidential, and not to be public disclosed, publicly disclosed, attaches to the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.292" offset="8152856">Which means that both the newspaper and the custodian of the document is bound to respect the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.257" offset="8180755">And the reason that that is important, and the reason why picking up this place of paper with knowledge, actual, or reputed, or otherwise, that this is a confidential document, which you have come into possession of accidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.025" offset="8235821">The reason that is important is because, when a rape victim, who is now recovering and analyzing whether she dare go down to the police station or not, to report this crime, and there is a serious problem of underreporting of rapes, wants to know whether she has any guarantee of anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.688" offset="8310531">Because if she knows if she reports this crimes the next day in the morning's newspapers her name is going to be spread all over the city, she's not apt to go.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.732" offset="11462675">Because I'm going to concede that as long as Cox Broadcasting Corp. is the law of the land, this 794.03, the one half of this statutory scheme that's an issue here, is overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.700" offset="11510531">But the Florida courts have construed it, to save it, and it ought to be saved in those cases where it can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.575" offset="11538012">Now, there may be circumstances where a rape victim has no reasonable expectation of privacy, that this statute could possibly implement, and that's clearly the case in his example with Senator Paula Hawkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.838" offset="11627037">It would be absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.080" offset="11632052">And no Florida court would ever apply this prohibition against printing on those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.314" offset="11648980">Now, the overbreadth challenge was raised, only briefly below, in a motion for directed verdict, which was abandoned when the post-judgment motions were abandoned by the filing of a notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.382" offset="11705300">The only thing I had to defend in the lower court was an "as applied" challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.313" offset="11720973">Overbreadth was mentioned in one paragraph in a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.407" offset="11737378">The Florida law is clear that court won't consider an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.741" offset="11754724">And, therefore, I think the issue before the court is whether this statutory scheme, applied in the context of a common law invasion of privacy action, is unconstitutional as applied, and not overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.178" offset="11800490">So I'm not prepared to concede to the court which cases fall in, and which cases fall out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.352" offset="11829120">I do insist, however, that this case clearly falls at the core of the right of privacy on the furthest fringes of the protections provided by the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.050" offset="11871961">And to apply that statute, 794.03, to the facts in this case, once those conflicting interests are balanced, does not result in an unconstitutional impairment of the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.605" offset="11914175">In my judgment, the first amendment interest in this case is absolutely trivial, or at least negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.550" offset="11945940">This court has written over and over, and over again, although it is not yet fully pinned down what the precise central meaning of the first amendment is, it seems at least to be qualified by some notion that the first amendment protects public discussion of public issues in matters of legitimate, public concern, and not matters about private people and their private concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.383" offset="12945280">And, the fact that her name is not on the face of this proceeding does not detract from the substance of this proceeding in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.898" offset="12971298">There can be no legitimate, public concerns sufficient to override the serious interests that are at issue in this case, and those interests are the plaintiff's constitutional right of privacy, both in the federal constitution, and the state constitution in the state of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.730" offset="13034619">Her statutory rights of privacy, granted by the two statutes in issue here, her common law right of privacy, the state's interest in what Justice O'Connor alluded to, when she talked about protecting the mental and physical security of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.187" offset="13088536">If you're the sole eyewitness to a rape, and your assailant didn't know you before the rape, the last thing in the world you want to do is walk down to the police station and have your name in the public, in the papers the next day, cause all that has to happen is the assailant looks you up in the phone book, finds out where you live, and eliminates you as the sole eye witness to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.881" offset="13163246">That is a very compelling Interest that, the state has to have In guaranteeing the anonymity of this victim, even at the expense of some negligible first amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.137" offset="13204310">And I have also alluded to the fact that the state has a compelling interest in encouraging people to report crimes of rape particularly rape crimes, because there is a serious underreporting of rape crises in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.325" offset="13257078">And on the compellingness of that interest, I would refer the court to the Canadian Supreme Court's recent decision in Her Majesty the Queen v. Canadian Newspapers, in which the Supreme Court of unanimous... excuse me, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously upheld against, a first amendment, or a freedom of the press challenge, a provision allowing a complainant, a rape victim, to get a court order from a judge prohibiting the publication of her name in instruments of mass communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.702" offset="13526557">I'd like to first address briefly the question of whether this case is a common law action, for invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.407" offset="13557381">And in answer to Justice Steven's question, Cape Publications v. Bridges, cited at page 40 of our brief, adopts essentially the restatement of torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.652" offset="13602312">Section 652(d) as to a common law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.686" offset="13626449">If you compare the restatement with the amended complaint, which is in the appendix to the Jurisdictional statement, starting at appendix page seven, you'll see that none of the elements of a common law cause of action for invasion of privacy are pleaded in this case, This is simply not a a common law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.260" offset="13708787">Finally, on that point, at the joint appendix on page 30, and a footnote in our brief on page six, the ruling of the Judge on the plaintiff's motion for directed verdict demonstrates that the ruling in this case was based on 794.03.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.233" offset="13784647">The mere act of publication created liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.906" offset="13799380">There is no, none of the protective measures developed in the law of libel involving fault, and the protection of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.321" offset="13836996">On the proposition that the statute protects victims by prohibiting publication, in the words of this court in Boston Globe, that proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.149" offset="13884330">There's nothing, there is no principal basis for limiting that type of analysis to rape victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.957" offset="13919543">That would be true of all victims of all crimes which are unsolved, and a ruling as that would severely Inhibit the ability to report on crime, which in Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn is a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.696" offset="13990492">Mr. Eaton talked about various distinctions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.380" offset="14009300">The victim being dead, the assailant being at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.903" offset="14023301">Those are not considerations under the statute, Those are not limiting factors under the statute, The statute is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.847" offset="14055171">It doesn't care whether the victim is dead or alive, whether the assailant is at large, whether the assailant has been convicted, or acquitted in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.357" offset="14121208">Your honor, we present the overbreadth challenge as a question under Cox Broadcasting, under Landmark of a first amendment question of whether there were less restrictive alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.376" offset="14169274">It was also raised as overbreadth at the trial courts and in the briefing in the First District Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.363" offset="14209189">But the question of whether less restrictive alternatives exist, which is to say whether the statute goes beyond the bounds necessary for protecting first amendment interest Is the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.282" offset="14260911">The first and fourteenth amendment question has been central throughout this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.817" offset="14347011">The first, the first amendment... excuse me, the first amendment analysis also questions whether first amendment restrictions are effective to achieve their purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.624" offset="14390270">And that, would be... an enlargement of the first amendment argument would be to the effect that this statute, because it doesn't restrict other publications, it is confined to press publications, is not effective in achieving the purpose, whatever that purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.065" offset="14452023">If we don't have a record of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.581" offset="14490057">We had a colloquy about truth as a defense, and I want to make it quite clear that that is an alternative basis for a ruling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.249" offset="14536764">I would suggest that this decision is due to be reversed on the most limited grounds set forth in Cox that the first and fourteenth amendments do not permit sanctions for a truthful publication of information, lawfully obtained from the public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.699" offset="14598518">I agree with Justice Scalia's analysis that, that the chapter 119 of the Florida statutes, creates a broad definition of public records.</text>
