            <text syncTime="19.795" offset="254918">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.966" offset="267666">Seventeen months ago the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad decided to go out of the railroad business.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.871" offset="291280">The simple undeniable fact in this case is that after years of losses and a fruitless search for a buyer, it finally found a buyer willing to buy its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.028" offset="335897">Deciding to exercise its fundamental right to go out of business, it entered into an agreement to sell certain of its assets to Railco.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.363" offset="369230">Now, 17 months later, much against its will, the railroad is still in business and it's still losing enormous amounts of money, Over one--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="58.871" offset="411235">How fundamental is that right not to go out of business?</text>
            <text syncTime="62.695" offset="426595">Can the Interstate Commerce Commission prevent a railroad from going... it can certainly prevent a railroad that stays in business from abandoning certain parts of its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.599" offset="466196">Can the Interstate Commerce Commission compel a railroad to continue to serve if it really wants to go entirely out of business?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_wyatt_jr" startTime="81.815" stopTime="112.727">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Wyatt, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="81.815" offset="502977">Your Honor, they cannot require them to serve indefinitely, as we indicate in the Fifth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.980" offset="527636">I believe the Brooks-Scanlon case was a railroad case where the Interstate Commerce Commission tried to prolong the railroad from going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.824" offset="555012">There is a point at which a losing railroad has a right, even as against the ICC, to go completely out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.079" offset="580090">But Mr. Justice Scalia is correct, the ICC does have the authority to require that railroad to delay its exit from the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.045" offset="615930">And that is exclusively the ICC's authority.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="112.727" offset="626692">And that's theoretically all we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.657" offset="634425">A delay of exit, I suppose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_wyatt_jr" startTime="117.099" stopTime="523.058">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Wyatt, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="117.099" offset="644142">Well, at this point we are now talking about a 17-month delay in exit, which appears to stretch on endlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.144" offset="664309">We are now talking about an interminable delay and we're talking about a specific ICC order in this case, Mr. Justice Scalia, which said the immediate consummation of that transaction to Railco was in the public interest and it should have been done immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.152" offset="712374">Instead, what we have in this case now are two companion rulings from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that hold that the company, while it was free to decide to go out of business, it could not do so until it completed the bargaining processes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.480" offset="777680">And it also held that RLEA's strike, launched, as the district court said, to deliberately frustrate the terms of the ICC-approved sale, and for that purpose alone, that that strike could not be enjoined as a violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.712" offset="842568">But, really, we believe three issues critical to the resolution of the issues this Court granted certiorari on.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.197" offset="872557">Those three issues are, first, the Interstate Commerce Act, the nature and scope of the Interstate Commerce Commission's exclusive and plenary jurisdiction in these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.364" offset="913203">The second is the nature and scope of the Railway Labor Act's bargaining command, and it's command... and its prohibition on unilateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.870" offset="955208">Do those bargaining commands and do those prohibitions apply to ICC-regulated transactions?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.923" offset="975479">We think there's a third critical issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.146" offset="984361">Depending on the resolution of the Interstate Commerce Act issue and the Railway Labor Act issue, it may not be necessary to reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.421" offset="1009439">But the third issue would be the accommodation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.081" offset="1020097">And that is if these two conflicting laws do... if these two laws do apply in a way where there is a conflict, what is the appropriate accommodation of the two laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.106" offset="1052175">Turning first to the Interstate Commerce Commission issue, we think it's clear, and it's always been clear, that in the case of fundamental corporate transactions involving rail carriers the Interstate Commerce Commission has exclusive and plenary jurisdiction to approve or disapprove those transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.169" offset="1128452">For instance, the exit of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad from the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.032" offset="1147888">That was governed under Section 10901 or 10903 of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.966" offset="1171607">The purchase of assets by Railco, or the potential purchase of assets, that was governed under Section 10901 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.561" offset="1205984">Exit, entrance, sale of assets, in most cases are subject to the extensive regulatory framework of the ICC, and that's because Congress has repeatedly recognized that railroads are infused with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.638" offset="1258333">And it's given the ICC a broad mandate to regulate railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.452" offset="1273589">It regulates the railroad system of this country in the public interest and under a standard of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.195" offset="1296577">This transaction was regulated, as I've indicated, under Section 10901 in the ICC's order in Ex Parte 392.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.290" offset="1328968">But more than just regulating corporate transactions or the sale of assets, entrance and exit of new companies, the ICC has very large discretionary jurisdiction over labor interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.211" offset="1384661">The interests of the Railway Labor Executives' Association in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.363" offset="1397200">Their interest comes from Section 10101(a), subsection 12, where they're charged by Congress with providing fair wages and suitable working conditions for the employees in the nation's rail industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.753" offset="1450803">And their interests and their discretion comes from further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.937" offset="1467522">Their discretion also goes back as far as the case of United States v. Lowden, this Court's decision in a discretionary transaction, this Court holding that the ICC had the discretionary authority to protect the interests of labor in the transaction to further labor peace and to improve the morale of the employees of the nation's railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.269" offset="1552890">For 50 years beginning before the Lowden case and continuing after the Lowden case, rail labor has regularly gone to the ICC and they've regularly gone to Congress and they've implored both, and usually been successful, to impose labor protective conditions in ICC-regulated transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.253" offset="1636795">In this particular case, this transaction was governed under the ICC's order In Ex Parte 392.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.907" offset="1663440">Rail labor participated fully and completely in the formulation of the policy of Ex Parte 392.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.492" offset="1689772">They participated actively.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.014" offset="1699803">They opposed what the ICC did in Ex Parte 392, but they were participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.317" offset="1721014">What they received from Ex Parte 392 was the right to petition the ICC in exceptional cases where they could demonstrate extraordinary circumstances in under 10901 and could show that their interests were truly being harmed by the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.067" offset="1780051">In this particular case, the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie transaction, rail labor never went to the ICC under Ex Parte 392 and tried to invoke its discretionary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.953" offset="1823623">Instead, rail labor went to the ICC and they went and said to the ICC, you should stay this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.790" offset="1854970">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="421.001" offset="1859777">Not stay it to look at the impact on labor, but stay it to give us, the employees, an opportunity to make a competing offer for this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.836" offset="1891123">We don't like the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.147" offset="1900319">We don't like Railco.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.328" offset="1909096">We want to make our own offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.491" offset="1917768">And we have an investment advisor, in fact, and he's going to offer an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.172" offset="1928426">And the affidavit of the investment advisor is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.474" offset="1937621">But from the very outset of this proceeding rail labor was insistent that they had a right, through the ICC process originally, to make an offer themselves to purchase the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.530" offset="1977850">So, they invoked all sorts of ICC jurisdiction under Ex Parte 392.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.342" offset="1997181">But the primary reason for the invocation, as the filings indicate, was not labor protections, to protect these employees from the effects of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.048" offset="2031976">But, instead, was to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="465.729" offset="2038663">"Give us an opportunity to buy the railroad. "</text>
            <text syncTime="467.491" offset="2045768">The ICC in an order in this particular case denied rail labor's motion for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.245" offset="2076697">They looked at the situation with the P&amp;LE, understanding the economic realities of a sale transaction, the fact that the financing wouldn't last forever for the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.324" offset="2125076">They looked at the entire situation and said the P&amp;LE is very weak, the P&amp;LE is very sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.795" offset="2142944">They are also essential to the national transportation interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.798" offset="2158931">This transaction needs to be consummated immediately, and we will not stay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.093" offset="2184113">They did suggest to the RLEA that RLEA could come before them after the fact... which is exactly what the 10505 exemption procedure requires... and orally they could come before them and raise all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.341" offset="2237089">They could even raise their claim to have the transaction reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.053" offset="2247956">And they ordered P&amp;LE to maintain its corporate existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.058" offset="2268018">Well, Mr. Wyatt, the Solicitor General, of course, takes a view somewhat different from yours and says it's true that we should not interpret the Acts here to preclude the railroad from going out of business but that the RLA can be reconciled with the statues governing the ICC by requiring some limited effects bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.739" offset="2406676">I do think, though, that the statutory scheme of the Interstate Commerce Commission comes into play in evaluating any duty to bargain over effects that might arise in a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.418" offset="2449412">And I think it's important for the Court to realize and focus on, contrary to the Solicitor's approach, how extensive those protections are and how powerful the ICC is and how vigilant it has been to protect the interests of rail labor employees from just the effects of these corporate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.687" offset="2514510">That has been their primary role with respect to rail labor for 50 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.764" offset="6982807">Your Honor, I think there's a couple of points I'd like to say in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.606" offset="6994196">First, we're talking about a particular type of transaction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.798" offset="7010915">A Section 10901 transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.581" offset="7022095">Now, there are other types of transactions covered by the ICA where the result could conceivably be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.793" offset="7042888">But in this we're only looking at a 10901 transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.004" offset="7051770">Secondly, this is a case where the transaction itself has been exempted from ICA regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.639" offset="7078310">What Section 10505 of the ICA gives the ICC is the power to exempt a transaction from its scrutiny on the basis that there is no need for the application of a particular provision of the ICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.548" offset="7134003">Now, if they've made that determination, then it seems somewhat difficult for us to argue that the ICA would in fact supersede another statute on the books.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.151" offset="7336400">--Your Honor, I think certainly there's a strong basis for that inference, based primarily on the fact that Section 10901 doesn't have any express preemptive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.179" offset="7384466">You can compare that to Section 11341 which does have an express preemptive provision in the case of mergers and consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.855" offset="7419156">In those cases, given the difference between those two statutes, that might well reflect a Congressional intent to treat these two types of transactions differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.291" offset="7448936">Again, since this is an accepted... exempted transaction, we think that the case is somewhat easier here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.836" offset="7475163">In this case, the railroad announced its decision to go out of business and its unions sought to modify their labor contracts to soften the blow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.060" offset="7512048">They invoked the RLA's collective bargaining mechanism for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.723" offset="7526676">We believe that the unions could properly invoke the RLA bargaining rights in these circumstances and that the railroad could not enjoin them from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.888" offset="7555306">But that does not mean that RLA had a duty to bargain about any and all aspects of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.171" offset="7576413">As the court of appeals correctly recognized and the unions apparently conceded below, the unions have no right to bargain about the actual decision to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.387" offset="7609328">The RLA, which specifies and specifically identifies the subjects of bargaining, does not require the railroad to bargain about business decisions which have always been treated as matters of managerial prerogative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.574" offset="7658020">But bargaining about the effects of the business decision is a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.937" offset="7671499">The RLA, by its terms, requires the railroad to bargain about rates of pay, rules and working conditions, and nothing in the RLA prohibits the union from proposing changes with respect to those matters in response to a railroad's business decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.206" offset="7724580">Two points, however, deserve special emphasis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.496" offset="7737746">And I think I've touched on them both already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.198" offset="7748508">First, the RLA's limitation on subjects of bargaining reflects Congress' judgment that management must be free from the constraints of the bargaining process to the extent necessary to exercise business judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.677" offset="7798454">But it follows that a union is not entitled to engage in effects of bargaining for the improper purpose of thwarting an employer's exercise of that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.322" offset="8193008">Well, it's a question of whether or not this is a mandatory subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.995" offset="8207741">And if it's not a mandatory subject of bargaining, then, of course, the railroad can go forward and take the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.198" offset="8228534">I admit that that is a closer question, but the government would believe that that would not be a mandatory subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.612" offset="8258209">This brings us to the most important issue in this case, and that is P&amp;LE's status quo obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.818" offset="8287048">The court of appeals broadly held that if a union serves a Section 6 notice that proposes changes in the collective bargaining agreement, Section 6 prohibits the railroad from taking actions adverse to labor even though such actions would be permissible or authorized under the existing employer/employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.177" offset="8352459">We believe that that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.189" offset="8360505">The RLA is concerned, as I said before, with the formation and maintenance of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.455" offset="8393628">And Section 6, which sets forth the process for the change in such agreements, provides the railroad must continue to honor its existing obligations with respect to those subjects during the bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.281" offset="8436887">But it does not prevent the railroad from taking actions that are authorized under existing collective agreements or through the understanding of the parties, as reflected in established work practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.678" offset="8474503">Indeed, if a railroad were precluded from taking such actions, then many existing agreements and implicit understandings would be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.475" offset="8505641">For example, a union could always thwart a railroad's exercise of a contractual right to take future action by simply filing a Section 6 notice before the action is taking and invoking Section 6 status quo requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.871" offset="8555274">Plainly, the RLA was not intended to produce that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.452" offset="8565618">Instead, existing terms and conditions of employment are part of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.427" offset="8585471">We believe that this is the only position that is consistent with Section 6's language and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.191" offset="8608563">We believe that this position is also consistent with this Court's decision in Shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.743" offset="8626745">The question there was whether the collective bargaining agreements were the sole source for determining working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.228" offset="8652658">The Court held that one must look as well to implicit understandings, as expressed in the actual on-the-job practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.390" offset="8681288">The Court did not hold that the railroad must preserve jobs apart from the express or implicit understandings that define and condition the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.337" offset="8721099">It viewed those as a part of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.508" offset="8729772">Our interpretation, in addition to being consistent with the RLA's language and legislative history and this Court's precedence, also furthers the RLA's fundamental policy of encouraging the formation of agreements that specify in advance the rights of management and labor in the face of future contingencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.331" offset="8801138">Furthermore, it avoids the possibility of an erosive taking of an insolvent railroad who would be forced to continue its operations against its will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.867" offset="8831231">In this case, as P&amp;LE indicated, the collective bargaining agreements are not before the court, and the parties have not established the past practices with respect to reductions in work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.002" offset="8871773">If P&amp;LE's unions have already negotiated applicable job security arrangements or certain severance benefits are an established work practice in these circumstances, then the unions are permitted the continuation of those arrangements or benefits during the bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.373" offset="8933213">But if, on the other hand, the agreements and practices authorize work force reductions without such protections, then that is the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.589" offset="8962157">And if the parties have differing interpretations of the agreements and past practices, then their disagreement is subject to resolution under the RLA's so-called minor dispute provisions which call for binding arbitration of such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.345" offset="9013148">I think it's important to note that binding arbitration can even go to the question of whether there is or is not a major or minor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.572" offset="9046062">This is something that is indicated in Section 3 Second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.254" offset="9064766">So, in fact, the adjustment board can provide complete relief in these circumstances and also can make some of these determinations that advance to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.350" offset="9101128">At this point the... our brief, of course, was filed before the unions filed theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.874" offset="9123280">And we, of course, left open the question that there was a dispute over the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.177" offset="9144492">P&amp;LE now suggests that perhaps they agree on what the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.092" offset="11552146">And the reason for that is that corporate decisions of a carrier that do not affect rates of pay, rules or working conditions, do not change rates of pay, rules or working conditions do not require notice and were not... there is no status quo that prohibits the implementation of such a corporate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.145" offset="11640335">The only time that you have a conflict between the two statutes is where the parties, the carriers, tend to use the Interstate Commerce Act to justify changes in existing collectively-established rates of pay, rules or working conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.155" offset="12704355">And this is where we get back to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.667" offset="12714386">At the time the Railway Labor Act was enacted, it was enacted for an industry that was heavily regulated, an industry where it was a startling innovation to believe that a railroad could go out of business any time it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.954" offset="12767571">Railroads couldn't even become debtors under the Bankruptcy Act as it existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.038" offset="12791917">And it wasn't until 1933 that they were allowed to even become... in the reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.204" offset="12820547">The only way they could restructure financially was through the equity receiverships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.796" offset="12838937">This was the understanding that Congress had and that the parties had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.439" offset="12853566">And what the labor representatives who drafted the bill that was modified in some forms but not in Section 2 First or Section 6 that are applicable here, indicated to Congress the intent of that statute was to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.839" offset="12915110">It was to implement the bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.831" offset="12927127">It was to implement the requirement that the Railroad Labor Board in 1920... 1921... had promulgated, that any time management makes a decision that would affect rates of pay, rules or working conditions, it must give notice and it must bargain with the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.044" offset="12999956">So, what the drafters of that legislation did... and they specifically sighted Wilson v. Nu, which this Court had decided in 1917, which dealt with Congress' power to regulate railroads and to impose obligations on railroads... and they said we're relying upon that power to impose an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.536" offset="13077906">The obligation that was imposed, because of the great transportation needs of railroads at that time, which we submit still exist to a degree today was that Congress was not going to allow the rail industry to become disrupted by labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.836" offset="13147078">But, rather, would adopt the solution that management and labor had devised, which provided that any time there is to be a change in working conditions... not a violation of the agreement, but a change... and the expiration of a contract is a change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.550" offset="13334010">But if the way in which they will go out of business will affect rates of pay, rules and working conditions, that management prerogative is limited by the statute which says there has to be bargaining about it first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.055" offset="13376015">The example that your Honor raised in an earlier case, the Conrall case, is a perfect example of what I'm talking about here where there is a reporting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.470" offset="13409661">Assume employees had to report to work at 7:45 in the morning and the railroad wanted to change it to 8:00 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.474" offset="13441635">Would they have to give notice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.207" offset="13448635">Would that be a change in working conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.728" offset="13458666">It's obviously a change in working conditions if you're moving your reporting requirement 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.071" offset="13480087">But the question as to whether or not notice was required was is it a working condition that is embodied in collectively established agreements, implied and explicit or written agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.770" offset="13530869">If it is, even though it might not be prohibited by the agreements, it is still the type of thing that requires advance notice before the carrier does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.086" offset="13568067">Now, on the other hand, if it's not, as would typically be the case, what then comes into play is the carrier could make that change unless the union believes that it is important to its people that that change not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.735" offset="13622715">In which case, it has the right under Section 6 to serve what's known as the Section 6 notice to request bargaining about that particular change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.050" offset="13655943">If it does, then an entirely different concept... and this is the concept that is really involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.715" offset="13674647">Not so much whether it is an obligation to bargain over the impact of this decision on employees, but what are the ramifications of the statute during that bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.921" offset="13719473">And that's the status quo obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.613" offset="13730235">And if you look at 5 First Section 6 of the Act, and Section 10 of the Act, as this Court did in Detroit Toledo, and as the language clearly shows, in 2 Seventh and 6... in the first part of Section 6 it talks about changes affecting agreements establishing rates of pay, rules or working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.188" offset="13824485">And then, in 5 First, it says that during that bargaining process no change shall be made in agreements affecting rates of pay, rules or working conditions or established practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.815" offset="13879029">And in Section 10 of the Act it says that during the dispute process no change shall be made in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.554" offset="13921974">And the legislative history, as this Court pointed out just 20 years ago in Detroit Toledo, was that the language was broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.890" offset="13955306">It was intended to be broad because the concept was that while bargaining was going on, whether it's mandatory bargaining in the sense that the carrier has to give the notice or bargaining because the union gave the notice, no change shall be made in the actual objective working conditions broadly conceived which are involved in or related to the dispute because--</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.211" offset="14504609">The two were different; economic regulations are different than labor relations regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.242" offset="14524776">There is an overlap in this one sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.756" offset="14534807">The Interstate Commerce Act is concerned with the underlying public interest in an efficient rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.520" offset="14565840">The Railway Labor Act is concerned with preventing disputes over labor matters from reaching the level of interruption to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.866" offset="14599277">The difference between the two Acts is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.607" offset="14610144">The Railway Labor Act, as this Court said in the Terminal Railroad case, is not concerned whatsoever with the fairness or the equities of whatever bargaining agreement might be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.275" offset="14656851">The Interstate Commerce Act, on the other hand, is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.778" offset="14670852">So what Congress has said... and this is right in the 1940 legislation where for the first time Congress required imposed protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.002" offset="14703767">The reason... prior to that, four years earlier, rail labor had gotten together with the railroads and had entered into the Washington Job Protection Agreement which formed a form of protection for railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.612" offset="14754235">When Congress was considering in 1940 what became the 1940 Transportation Act where employee protection was imposed as a mandatory requirement, the position that rail labor took was they were asking for the mandatory protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.433" offset="14817452">And it was asked, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.133" offset="14824348">If you already have it by this agreement, why do we have to make it mandatory?</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.896" offset="14843365">And the answer for that was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.919" offset="14851411">Only 85 percent of the mileage in the country was under the Washington Job Protection Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.890" offset="14871368">There were others who refused to come under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.521" offset="14881817">There were other employees who were not covered by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.954" offset="14895610">And that's what Congress is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.235" offset="14904701">The Interstate Commerce Act makes no differentiation at all between represented and non-represented employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.578" offset="14926121">It applies equally to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.801" offset="14935003">It applies equally to all regardless of what form of protection they might have gained by bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.234" offset="14960707">Now, what happened in the history of the Act and the relationship between the two is that from 1940 to... in the middle 40's the Interstate Commerce Act Commission was developing the formal protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.663" offset="15014415">Then when the Interstate Commerce Commission protections didn't keep up with the trend and the development of the Washington Job Protection in the industry, and, in fact, was actually below the Washington Job, the unions went to the collective bargaining table and negotiated collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.654" offset="15074392">We've cited in our brief several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.856" offset="15087140">And if you look at the major merger cases in the '50s and the '60s, they were all negotiated agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.090" offset="15116083">Now, the ICC and the P&amp;LE say well, they were all negotiated under the auspices of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.526" offset="15145863">Well, the Interstate Commerce Act doesn't give rail labor a right to negotiate anything on behalf of anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.311" offset="15180972">The negotiation that reached the agreement could only be binding on the employees because it was negotiation under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.265" offset="15208870">And when you look at the two Acts what you see... in a sense it's like history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3770.543" offset="15257981">And the reason there was no conflict was because the two Acts work hand in hand as part of a single form of regulation of the rail industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.381" offset="15301239">The Interstate Commerce Act with its mandatory minimums, the Railway Labor Act with an ability on rail labor's part to either accept, as they did in many cases, the mandatory minimums, or to negotiate what they believed was fair and equitable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3809.609" offset="15414193">It would be a combination, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.911" offset="15419417">Normally the agreements were reached beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.962" offset="15427568">But, for instance in the 70s, in the Northern Lines merger case, the ICC first turned it down when there was no agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.038" offset="15463930">And then an agreement was reached and the ICC approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.339" offset="15473125">In some of the other cases, the ICC cases which were cited in P&amp;LE's brief, the agreements were entered into after the merger actually took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.904" offset="15507398">The Milwaukee case is an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.386" offset="15513354">After the merger occurred, the ICC imposed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.047" offset="15527982">An agreement was then entered into which modified those conditions and that became the form of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.441" offset="15545537">Now, in 1971... 1972... this Court decided the Nemitz case, Norfolk and Western Railroad v. Nemitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.994" offset="15575734">And in that case it said that even though you have this negotiated form of protection and the ICC's role up to that point was that it's policy was you have a negotiated agreement, fine, we don't look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.503" offset="15625785">This Court said that that was wrong and that that was actually a part of the order of the commission and rail labor could not substantially abrogate whatever had in fact been negotiated or imposed by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.362" offset="15677194">So, there is a relationship in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.783" offset="15686911">The rail labor can negotiate an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.576" offset="15702062">But if that agreement doesn't meet the minimum standards, the floor that the statute imposes, then the ICC still has to impose that floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.611" offset="15734245">If the agreement exceeds the floor and it is adopted as the protection, then that becomes part of the ICC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.657" offset="15762353">But the parties cannot substantially abrogate below the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.807" offset="15774996">Now, when you look at the Acts in this light and you remember the fact that notice is only required where there is a change in working conditions caused by the agreement, there is no conflict between the Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.858" offset="15839153">The only time you get a conflict between the two Acts is what has occurred in this case where the carrier's relying upon the ICC's belief that it is this labor board now say, well, wait a minute, we can sell, we can abrogate your contracts and you can't bargain about it, and you can't insist that we bargain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.543" offset="15925984">And that is where the conflict occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.544" offset="15933925">Now, on this one point, I point out that the policy that we're talking about, the Ex Parte 392 policy, is a creation not of Congress but of the Interstate Commerce Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.562" offset="15981990">Where Congress has considered and developed programs such as the feeder line programs, it specifically provided various forms of protection that would apply and how employees would be treated as a minimum level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.249" offset="16028802">But this is one that the chairman of the ICC has stated was an unpleasant surprise, an unexpected gain out of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.547" offset="16081987">This encouragement of short-line programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.770" offset="16090869">And the only reason it has been so popular is because for the first time the railroads are using the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority as a means to abrogate existing agreements, to change the agreements and not bargain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.590" offset="16150115">And we submit that that's not in any way near the intent of the relationship between the two Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4758.771" offset="19210830">We believe, as I indicated to you in my earlier presentation about the Interstate Commerce Act, that the Interstate Commerce Commission does have very broad discretion to address the effects of these transactions and that once they enter that order, that order is properly reviewable in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.521" offset="19273837">But that a strike... and the district court expressly found here... that the strike was designed not to compel Railway Labor Act bargaining but to frustrate this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.788" offset="19310931">The strike should have been enjoined in that the Norris-LaGuardia Act can be and should be accommodated to the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.883" offset="19347293">And, moreover, we believe, as does the Solicitor... we believe there was absolutely no bargaining duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.558" offset="19378013">And where there is no duty to engage in collective bargaining, we believe that an injunction will rely under the Railway Labor Act, Section 2 First.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.404" offset="19409360">We think that where we have no duty to bargain and where we aren't violating the status quo, that a Railway Labor Act injunction will lie to prohibit a strike and 2 First would be the proper foundation for that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.680" offset="19458470">So, we believe that the injunction was properly entered, improperly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.465" offset="19477592">We think the Third Circuit was just wrong when it said Norris-LaGuardia shouldn't be accommodated with the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4852.453" offset="19585530">I think it provides an elaborate mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.714" offset="19594621">It gives the ICC tremendous discretion to impose labor protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.977" offset="19615623">It gives the union rights to review in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.689" offset="19626490">It gives... if labor protections are imposed... and these are, by the way, generally far more than contractual, mere preservation of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.125" offset="19656270">They are additional protections over and above.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.705" offset="19662539">But if they're imposed, the ICC can appoint ICC arbitrators to hear disputes about their... about the use.</text>

            <text syncTime="4944.882" offset="19955319">And those are all major assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.414" offset="19961380">Had P&amp;LE engaged in that bargaining but nonetheless completed the transactions, which is consistent with the government's theory, a Railway Labor Act injunction would lie to prohibit the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.401" offset="20005370">I did want to address my closing remarks to the status quo argument that's been made here today by RLEA and their reading of Detroit and Toledo Shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.698" offset="20054585">I think to understand Detroit and Toledo Shoreline one has to go back to what is the Railway Labor Act's prohibition on unilateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.254" offset="20096799">And the Railway Labor Act prohibits in Section 2 Seven unilateral action that would change rates of pay, rules, or working conditions as embodied in agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.372" offset="20137236">Now, RLEA is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.904" offset="20147372">There are other places where the "as embodied in the agreement's" language doesn't necessarily appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.308" offset="20165030">But I think Detroit and Toledo Shoreline properly read says that a working practice may become an implied agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.683" offset="20206513">In that case, there was a question about where people reported to work and there was a unilateral change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.816" offset="20226993">I don't think Detroit and Toledo Shoreline can be read any broader than to say the status quo is composed of explicit agreements and what can fairly be said to be an implicit agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.455" offset="20277566">And I think the notion that the status quo is composed of whatever existed on the property on the day the notice was served is ludicrous because what that does is simply take away from management whatever preexisting rights it had that day, rights that hadn't been exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.607" offset="20342245">It simply freezes them in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.337" offset="20349141">And that's clearly the Act and its bargaining obligations and it's status quo obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.620" offset="20370248">We're not intending to freeze people in time as they existed on day one or day two.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.974" offset="20387698">But all they're meant to do... I'm sorry, my time is up.</text>
