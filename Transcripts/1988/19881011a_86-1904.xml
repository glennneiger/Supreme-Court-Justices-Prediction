            <text syncTime="20.673" offset="225175">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.107" offset="242939">This case concerns whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires dismissal of a state criminal conviction for the alleged failure of police to properly preserve and to test certain materials obtained from a rape victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.545" offset="296646">The Respondent was convicted by a jury of crimes involving the rape of a boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.931" offset="318171">The Arizona Court of Appeals found that the Respondent was denied due process because of police inaction in two areas: first, that police did not perform certain tests on materials they had obtained from the rape victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.008" offset="370521">These materials were properly preserved as they were refrigerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.721" offset="385358">And secondly, the police did not refrigerate the victim's undergarments that they had obtained when the victim went to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.544" offset="416601">The lower court found that these inactions on the part of the police constituted a due process violation requiring reversal of the jury's verdicts and dismissal of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.964" offset="466338">It is the State's position that the lower court has substituted speculation about the evidentiary value of these materials for the constitutional standard of materiality and in doing so, has obviated the role of the jury as the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.296" offset="531644">The circumstances regarding the collection of the evidence in question are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.599" offset="552855">On October 29, the 10 year old boy was kidnapped and raped.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.241" offset="579396">Omitting the details of the crime, he was taken to the hospital shortly after the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.057" offset="602697">At the hospital the boy was treated for his injuries and, in addition, the treating physician used what is known as a sexual assault kit.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.923" offset="638119">It's a device.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.333" offset="643762">It's a device... it's a kit that collects evidence from different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.436" offset="656196">But in this particular instance, the physician used a swab, swabbed the boy's rectum, made a microscopic slide of the contents of the smear, gave it to police who refrigerated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.543" offset="712620">And that was the proper thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.025" offset="718576">At the time, the police also gathered the boy's undershirt and his underpants.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.852" offset="753894">Those were placed in a bag and placed in property, and they were not refrigerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.413" offset="772075">About nine days after the gathering of that evidence, the police criminologist examined the microscope slide obtained at the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.981" offset="814393">He found that there was spermatozoa present on the slide, but found only a small portion of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.273" offset="12391549">The Court of Appeals did not hold... and I do not advocate a position... that the loss of evidence automatically results in any particular sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.040" offset="12422583">If the evidence is lost through inadvertence, that in and of itself is some evidence that perhaps that bit of data was not material or significant in any particular way because the police didn't bother to gather it, the defense didn't draw the police attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.620" offset="12480993">And so, that would come into play there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.352" offset="12499905">But if the police are exercising reasonable care in following their procedures and the evidence is still lost, that is of small benefit to the accused who finds that he cannot put on his defense as a result of the loss of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.230" offset="12551419">And for those reasons, I would urge that good faith and bad faith not enter into the question at this stage, but that instead, unless... if the defense can prove bad faith, then I would say that that is a different case and it's not worthy of the same standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.203" offset="12623308">But when we have... when everybody intended to gather the evidence, intended to test the evidence and intended to preserve the evidence, and then simply failed to do so, we must look at the... our conviction in... regarding the fairness of the trial and our certainty that the outcome is a reliable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.685" offset="12701257">And because those should be the guiding principles as far as fashioning the remedy, the courts should be given broad latitude in providing remedies ranging from absolutely nothing at all to jury instructions to instructions that certain facts must be presumed to the contrary of the position taken by the spoliator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.539" offset="12792581">And finally, in some cases, in order to preserve the integrity of the judicial process, after the court, as the Arizona Court of Appeals did, considered all other sanctions, the court may find that fairness and due process require a dismissal of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.461" offset="12856320">That sanction should be available to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.532" offset="12868650">The Court of Appeals on the record before this Court reviewed those various options and made it very clear that they were aware of the range of potential sanctions and found that it is only because... that it is only a dismissal of the charges that can protect Mr. Youngblood's due process rights... did they order a dismissal of the charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.279" offset="13759634">That's how it comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.159" offset="13767157">The characterization as to the underwear as the better sample was really speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.382" offset="13787951">It's based only upon the expert who never saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.036" offset="13802580">And there was evidence in the record, which I need not go into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.239" offset="13819402">It was just basically that the victim washed up and that the victim then put his clothes back on shortly after the crime and was taken in a quick manner to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.335" offset="13867781">So, what was or was not on the underwear, without examining it, was pure speculation.</text>
