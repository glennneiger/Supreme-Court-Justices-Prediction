            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145175">We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1190, United States against Broce.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.842" offset="180493">Mr. Englert, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="roy_t_englert_jr" startTime="11.855" stopTime="244.402">
            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.855" offset="192509">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of whether defendants who plead guilty to two facially valid indictments have the right to claim later, for the first time on collateral attack, that they were guilty of only one crime, despite what the indictment said.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.880" offset="260636">The Tenth Circuit held that defendants do have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.722" offset="272026">We contend that they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.674" offset="279862">On November 17, 1981, a grand jury in the District of Kansas indicated Ray Broce, Broce Construction Company, and the General Manager of Broce Construction Company on a single charge of Sherman Act conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.903" offset="340780">The indictment specifically alleged that the conspiracy began in or about April, 1978, and had as its object the rigging of bids on a road construction project in Meade County, Kansas, let on April 25, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.303" offset="402324">On February 4, 1982, the grand jury returned its second indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.363" offset="422595">This indictment also alleged Sherman Act conspiracy, specifically alleged this conspiracy began in July of 1979 and had as its object the rigging of bids on a Barton County construction project that was let on July 17, 1979, also in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.387" offset="490723">In late January of 1982, the Government and the defendants were already engaged in plea negotiations, and by the time the second indictment was handed up, the defendants had agreed to plead guilty to the Meade County and Barton County charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.179" offset="553835">The Government, for its part, had agreed not to prosecute these defendants any further for bid rigging in either Kansas or Oklahoma, to dismiss one count of mail fraud against the corporation, and to make certain recommendations at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.655" offset="623738">The guilty pleas were duly taken on February 8, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.608" offset="639516">In a written statement of facts in support of the pleas, the Government described the two conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.354" offset="662504">The statement shows that each of the two projects involved in the indictments was the quid pro quo for concessions that Broce made to the co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.850" offset="708479">In the case of the April 25, 1978 bidletting, there was a trade-off of several projects that were let on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.643" offset="739722">In the case of the July, 1979 bidletting, Broce paid $75,000 to a co-conspirator who would otherwise have bid competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.124" offset="777652">Nothing in that written statement of facts suggests any relationship between the April, 1978 conspiracy and the July, 1979 conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.839" offset="812447">In fact, there was some colloquy at the plea-taking hearing in which Mr. Broce, under oath, mentioned that he would not trade off a Gray County project that was to be let at a subsequent bid letting for the Meade County project, because he intended each letting to stand on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.973" offset="880992">The facts of this case were visited one more time, on March 15, 1982, when the defendants were sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.907" offset="908786">The Government prepared an official version of the offense, which was included in the pre-sentence report of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.952" offset="932924">Like the statement of facts in support of the pleas, the official version of the offense described the two conspiracies in some detail, again saying what the quid pro quos were.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.744" offset="976078">Again, it showed no relationship between the April, 1978 and July, 1979 conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.148" offset="1001678">Furthermore, the official version of the offense made explicit what had been implicit all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.647" offset="1023725">It said in so many words that there were two separate conspiracies giving rise to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.160" offset="1045773">The defendants were given an opportunity at sentencing to contest anything contained in the official version of the offense, and they did have some quarrels with it, but no quarrel at all with the proposition there were two separate conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.061" offset="1089345">In early 1983, a decision was handed down in a separate but related Kansas bid rigging--</text>

            <text syncTime="273.171" offset="1237825">The decision In United States v. Beachner Construction Company came down in early 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.215" offset="1265933">The District Court held in that case that all the bid rigging on highway construction projects in Kansas, throughout the entire period of the 1960's and 1970's, was one massive, continuing, ongoing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.788" offset="1320267">The Broce defendants sought to take advantage of the Beachner ruling, even though they had already admitted participating in two conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.301" offset="1350360">In a Rule 35 motion, they asked the District Court to hold that because they had been guilty of only one conspiracy, even though they had pleaded to two, their sentences were illegal, and the corporation's $750,000... the corporation's fine had to be reduced by $750,000, the individual's fine by $50,000.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="331.850" offset="1472509">--Including these two, every highway construction project in Kansas throughout the 60's and 70's.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.271" offset="1490168">The Government strenuously contested the defendants' claim that they had the right to escape from their prior plea bargains on the basis of Beachner, although the Government stipulated that the Court could consider the Beachner record.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.421" offset="1554847">The District Court agreed with the Government that the defendants' guilty pleas foreclosed their belated attempt to contend that they had been guilty of only one conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.416" offset="1594762">In so ruling, the District Court relied upon the First Circuit's ruling in Kerrigan v. United States, which says that if the defendant once he pleads guilty to multiple conspiracies, cannot contest the theoretical and factual foundations of the indictment or indictments alleging those conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.707" offset="1655993">The Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.550" offset="1671353">In a ruling that it has since acknowledged was erroneous, the Tenth Circuit first held that the defendants' right not to be sentenced twice for the same offense, when they had only committed one offense, was "absolute" and not subject to forfeiture or waiver in any way, no matter how hard they tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.542" offset="1739271">The Court also held that the question of one conspiracy versus two required factual proceedings on remand, and the Court therefore sent the case back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.741" offset="1784097">On remand, the District Court simply followed Beachner and held that there was one massive conspiracy, and that therefore these two bid riggings were part of that massive conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.098" offset="1957551">But as I understand Rule 35, the purpose of Rule 35 is to correct sentences that the legislature did not intend for the crimes for which the defendants had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.798" offset="2000287">We don't think the procedural posture of this case makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.014" offset="2021185">The basis issue is the Constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.028" offset="2029231">We appealed the District Court's ruling vacating the defendants' conviction and sentences for the second conspiracy, but the Tenth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.087" offset="2069459">The Tenth Circuit now acknowledged its earlier error in saying that the double Jeopardy right was absolute, but it said the issue now was whether the guilty pleas themselves "waived the double Jeopardy protection" and it found no such waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.926" offset="2120868">We're here today arguing that the Tenth Circuit's decision should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.485" offset="2143020">We think there are two independently sufficient reasons why the results should not be as the Tenth Circuit saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.639" offset="2167679">First, the Tenth Circuit completely overlooked the fact that the way to raise and resolve factual disputes is not to plead guilty, but to litigate those disputes after a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.729" offset="2216058">The holding of the Tenth Circuit, that litigation of factual disputes can be postponed until after a guilty plea, is absolutely unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.802" offset="2256287">Second, the pleas in this case induced the Government to rely on those pleas in dismissing other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.656" offset="2307696">The Government's detrimental reliance, we think, is also a basis for holding the defendants to their pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.872" offset="2336639">We think both of these factors serve to distinguish Menna v. New York and Blackledge v. Perry, the only the cases in which this Court has ever held that a defendant can escape from a guilty plea entered knowingly and voluntarily on advice of competent counsel through proper procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.208" offset="2409991">I know you don't argue this, but is it not theoretically possible, at least, that the one ongoing, complete conspiracy that went on for many, many years was one cries, and that pursuant to that conspiracy, from time to time, the defendants would enter into separate bid-rigging agreements on particular jobs, which could be both pursuant to the overall conspiracy in one sense, but also separate violations of the law in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.026" offset="2509257">So that couldn't you, at least theoretically, say that there were two conspiracies even though there was one ongoing conspiracy?</text>

            <text syncTime="663.997" offset="2801097">When a defendant is faced with criminal charges, he has essentially two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.259" offset="2834115">He can put the Government to its proof, or he can plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.446" offset="2846863">The whole point of a guilty plea is to substitute an admission of the Government's allegations for the right to put the Government to its proof and have those allegations adjudicated by the Court and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.144" offset="2897750">The choice between those two options, once made, is not revocable simply because the defendant later thinks better of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.500" offset="2927111">In particular, as to factual matters, the defendant has to put the matter in issue and get it resolved before pleading guilty, or else forget about pursuing the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.292" offset="2966295">This is in essence exactly what the First Circuit said in Kerrigan, and we think the Kerrigan approach is exactly the one this Court should adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.258" offset="2994194">We think that approach follows pretty readily from Menna itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.602" offset="3007568">There is a long footnote in the Menna opinion which is the subject of most of the interpretation in the lower courts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.286" offset="3034318">The Court said in that footnote two things that we think are vitally important.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.049" offset="3049364">First of all, it said that a plea of guilty quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.984" offset="3077054">Second, the Court expressly limited its holdings to the situation in which the invalidity of the indictment can be "Judged on its face".</text>
            <text syncTime="744.011" offset="3121149">We think the upshot of those two observations together is that when the indictment is valid on its face, and a claim of invalidity depends on factual matters, the plea of guilty quite validity resolves those factual issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.729" offset="3440052">The defendants were given an opportunity, on the record, to say otherwise, and they declined that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.915" offset="3456770">The record in this case couldn't be clearer that the defendants agreed that there were two separate conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.444" offset="3478922">Now, the Tenth Circuit's only response to the argument I've just made, based on Menna, was a single sentence saying that the facts admitted in a guilty plea go only to factual innocence or guilt and not to whether there were two conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.015" offset="3537227">The Tenth Circuit followed that sentence with a citation to the Ninth Circuit's decision in Launlus v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.388" offset="3558648">The problem with the Tenth Circuit's response is that Launlus doesn't support it, no other case supports it, and no logic supports it.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.014" offset="3709217">The Fifth Circuit divided all these cases into three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.154" offset="3721756">The first category is cases like Menna, in which it's clear from the face of the indictment that there are invalid charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.245" offset="3750073">In those cases, of course, at least in the absence of a plea bargain, one grants relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.258" offset="3770135">The second category is cases in which it's clear from the face of the indictment that there are two separate crimes; and in those cases, the Fifth Circuit said, relief can be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.300" offset="3818305">In the vast middle category, in which the indictment neither proves conclusively nor disproves the existence of separate crimes, the Fifth Circuit said the Constitution always commands an evidentiary hearing on these collateral attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.450" offset="3874938">We think that Broce falls into the Atkins court second category.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.012" offset="3893119">In other words, we think the record shows conclusively there were two conspiracies, and the Tenth Circuit had no business letting the defendants supplement and contradict their prior factual admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.164" offset="3933766">But I think it's also important for the Court to understand that we think Atkins is quite wrong in saying that the Constitution requires evidentiary hearings in cases of ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.958" offset="3968979">The correct categorization, in our view, is just two categories: the Menna cases, in which you can tell from the face of the indictment that there is an invalid charge, and all other cases, in which the defendant should not be entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.453" offset="4022896">The reason why the defendant should not be entitled to relief is that he has the opportunity, by seeking a bill of particulars, by litigating, to put the Government to its proof in cases of vague indictments, to make the Government supplement the allegations, and to make any counter allegations he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.242" offset="4094053">There's no reason why he should be allowed to postpone until after his guilty plea litigation over issues he could have resolved before the guilty plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.244" offset="5830151">In Menna and Blackledge, as far as the face of the opinions disclose, there was no plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.695" offset="5855856">Even if there was, there was only one charge in each case, so it appears that all the Government could have bargained away was its right to make certain recommendations concerning sentence on the very Invalid charges charged in those indictments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.602" offset="6307565">I'd first like to deal with the factual issues that counsel for the Government has referred to, because there's substantial variation in our interpretation of the facts and their Interpretation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.004" offset="6353123">There Is no question that an original indictment was brought against Broce Construction and Ray Broce, and his chief foreman, for bid-rigging activities In Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.297" offset="6406308">And it named a certain project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.716" offset="6416026">We are not here disputing the factual basis for that indictment, or that indeed the defendants were guilty of the crime as alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.416" offset="6454791">It was not until January of 1982, after the Government notified Mr. Broce, when he was set to go to trial, that in the event you proceed to trial, we will bring another indictment against Ray Broce, Broce Construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.425" offset="6522814">This was consistent, as we've alleged in our brief, with the Government's position in each case, because every defendant who approached trial was notified that they were going to be indicted again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.872" offset="6564610">Now, when the significance of this comes about when you look at the Government's own statement, when it talks about the Government's theory of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.516" offset="7007229">In this case, the defendant instructed his attorneys that he did not want a trial, and that he wanted to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.295" offset="7034292">The defendant's attorneys contacted the Government in January of 1982 and notified them of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.699" offset="7063967">Unfortunately, the Government attorneys were already aware that Mr. Broce had so instructed his attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.320" offset="7090403">It was at that point that the Government told Mr. Broce's attorneys that the defendants would have to plead guilty to two indictments for conspiracy or face multiple trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.440" offset="7142857">That is put out in the affidavit of Mr. Crockett, who is the attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.825" offset="7208372">At this point in time, the defendants agreed to plead guilty to two indictments on different projects, in exchange for the Government not bringing succeeding indictments in Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.164" offset="13341818">A few brief points: the plea taking hearing is reprinted in its entirety on pages 29 to 49 of the joint appendix, and my reading of that hearing is rather different from Mr. Casebeer's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.567" offset="13383405">I just leave that for the Court to look at, if it believes there is anything important in those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.830" offset="13404408">Mr. Casebeer says there should be a Johnson v. Zerbest waiver required in this case, criminal defendants lose rights all the time, without being aware of them, because their lawyers fail to object to trial or fail to do other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.933" offset="13464907">The question that raises is ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.244" offset="13482148">This is not an ineffective assistance of counsel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.118" offset="13493642">I don't think... it has not been contended, and I don't think it could be seriously contended that it was outside the range of professional competence not to raise this issue before entering into this very advantageous plea agreement for these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.332" offset="13542439">Finally, I'd like to say a word about the underlying facts of Beachner and of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.064" offset="13565426">Before 1973, every Kansas highway construction job was rigged, virtually every job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.421" offset="13590817">In 1973, a company called Sanori Construction Company went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.668" offset="13607745">Following that, our antitrust division did an analysis and saw that only about 10 percent of the jobs were rigged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.057" offset="13637315">The rest were bid competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.556" offset="13643376">That was why we thought then and we still think today, that there were separate conspiracies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.162" offset="13665737">We did litigate that issue and lose in Beachner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.100" offset="13677544">We have not asked this Court to review it, but we certainly were proceeding in good faith in trying to prosecute these conspiracies separately for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.707" offset="13707951">Again, we're not contesting Beachner, but I can't resist adding, we think that's a ridiculous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.346" offset="13734491">The Court said that there's a common objective to fix prices and therefore raise profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.672" offset="13759777">Therefore, without more, there is one conspiracy.</text>
