            <text syncTime="12.002" offset="134575">These cases concern the constitutionality of the Sentencing Reformat of 1984, and that Act created the United States Sentencing Commission as an independent body in the Judicial Branch with power to promulgate binding sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.943" offset="222346">Guidelines have been issued and they are challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.093" offset="238960">Similar challenges in Federal Courts throughout the country have resulted in diverse and opposing rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.628" offset="273024">And because of that conflict in the great importance of the issues in the administration of this countryâ€™s criminal law, we granted the respective petitions of defendant, Mistretta, and of the United States for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.916" offset="354212">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, a too long opinion I have here, we hold that the sentencing guidelines are constitutional and specifically, that Congress did not delegate excessive legislative power to the Commission and did not violate the separation of powers principled by placing the Commission in the Judicial Branch or by requiring federal judges to serve on the Commission and to share their authority with non-judges or by empowering the President to appoint Commission members and to remove them for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.889" offset="522127">Therefore, in this litigation, we affirm the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.839" offset="557967">Justice Brennan joins all of the opinion except footnote 11; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
