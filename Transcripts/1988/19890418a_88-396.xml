            <text syncTime="1088.456" offset="4494124">The rules of accrual accounting do not speak to the character as a currently deductible expense or as a capital item of the ceding commissions incurred in issuing indemnity reinsurance, any more than they speak to the character as a currently deductible expense or as a capital item of the expenses incurred in issuing directly written insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.904" offset="4579910">In fact, if the Commissioner were correct that the rules of accrual accounting require that ceding commissions in indemnity reinsurance be capitalized, they would also necessarily require that directly written expenses be capitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.498" offset="4638320">Yet, he agrees here, as he always has, that the expenses in issuing directly written insurance are to be deducted currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.902" offset="4667891">And thus he concedes that the rules of accrual accounting do not require a contrary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.258" offset="4697357">This Court should not countenance the Commissioner's disregard of the special provisions in Part I of Subchapter L which are based on NAIC accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.196" offset="4737063">The Commissioner's disregard of those rules simply should not be countenanced here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.100" offset="4760678">Resort to some general or fundamental tax principle that might be applicable to any other taxpayer in any other setting to resolve the tax treatment of the ceding commissions involved in this case will produce an unsound result that is contrary to Part I of Subchapter L, the legislative history, and the regulations thereunder.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1315.750" offset="5403290">--Well, take, for example, an auto company that sells cars and takes installment loans back from its customers and then discounts those loans away to a third party that purchases the loans today, giving the car company that sold the loans a slightly smaller amount of money than the face value of the loans to reflect the time value of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.965" offset="5504123">The car company that receives the money would have to take that into income in the year it's received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.702" offset="5523140">On the other hand, the discounter who purchases the notes would have to amortize its purchase price over the life during which the notes were expected to produce income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.243" offset="5565249">So, that is an example which is in many ways parallel to the situation that we have here because Petitioner entered into this transaction and agreed to pay a ceding commission precisely because it anticipated receiving future profits in the form of premium and other income from the block of policies that it reinsured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.406" offset="5649886">This isn't just the Commissioner's point of view about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.108" offset="5664724">This is what the record unequivocally shows was Petitioner's anticipated benefit when it entered into this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.298" offset="5697533">There is an exhibit, Joint Exhibit 6-F, Part 8, which was entered into the record in the tax court, which was a letter from an actuary proposing this transaction to Petitioner and informing Petitioner about the potential benefits that it might realize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.323" offset="5761586">And it wrote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.925" offset="5767959">"These reinsurance treaties have been constructed to minimize loss to Colonial American. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.846" offset="5791679">"This is a seasoned and predictable block of business with virtually all policies over five years old. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.000" offset="5816338">"A computer projection of future profits was made and that projection showed that Colonial's pre-tax profit on the reinsurance transaction will be about $80,000. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.339" offset="5857612">And the letter concluded on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.641" offset="5870882">"The transport reinsurance arrangement should be a safe and profitable investment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.779" offset="5891362">And I submit that that is not what anyone has in mind when one talks about an insurance company writing a policy of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.067" offset="5924590">An insurance company does not view the policy of insurance as a safe and profitable investment the way Petitioner did when it paid a ceding commission to acquire rights from a block of policies that would produce income for it stretching over a period of seven years, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.429" offset="5993971">There are many contexts where this Court has considered basic rules of capitalization as they apply to companies in a variety of industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.035" offset="6028452">And at bottom the question always comes down to whether there has been a purchase price paid for the acquisition of a future benefit that will stretch more than one tax year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.465" offset="6542124">Well, let me make two points in response to that, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.001" offset="6556335">First of all, I do think that the plain language of the regulations can be read to support our position and not their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.672" offset="6586950">But it's very important in construing a fairly technical Tax Act, such as this, to take a look at the problems that Congress had identified and was trying to solve when it wrote the sections that are in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.330" offset="6633657">Now, as you pointed out, in Petitioner's argument 809(c)(1) is focused on the determination of premium income to an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.670" offset="6670960">And then it provides for certain deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.888" offset="6683812">The theory of the case that we presented... and two courts of appeals have written opinions extensively that accept this theory... is that that provision was designed to allow insurance companies to eliminate from their premium income amounts that with the benefit of hindsight never would have been included in it in the first place because they were amounts that a company turned over to a second company to obtain indemnity reinsurance or they were amounts that had to be paid back to policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.941" offset="6800110">And that's what Congress meant by return premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.259" offset="6813380">It didn't mean the purchase price of an income stream from a block of policies in a fairly complicated indemnity transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.317" offset="6853608">And I say that for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.051" offset="6860505">First of all, there is absolutely nothing in any of the legislative materials or the hearings that's been pointed out by any party to this case in the years of litigation that shows that Congress ever thought about ceding commissions, let alone thought about them in the fashion that Petitioner suggests as somehow analogous to agent's commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.279" offset="6937409">They're really not analogous to agent's commissions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.147" offset="6948903">They are payments that are made directly to the person who is in the position of the policyholder, according to Petitioner's theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.680" offset="9047058">Well, there's several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.466" offset="9058134">First of all, the Treasury Department never wrote this section having any indication that it would be used to cover ceding commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.905" offset="9095959">It was responding to a very different and a very specific problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.357" offset="9109752">A problem that actually resulted in the addition of the second sentence of 809(c)(1) to that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.296" offset="9145488">The problem there is a fairly intricate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.129" offset="9156772">It relates to the distinction between dividends and return premiums for purposes of deduction under this aspect of the Life Insurance Company Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.937" offset="9196061">Congress wanted basically to make clear that an insurance company could not take all of its investment earnings and redistribute them back to its policyholders, call them return premiums and deduct them all in the year that they were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.879" offset="9259799">That would allow insurance companies to escape taxation on that investment income, which Congress distinctly wanted not to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.754" offset="9299297">It did, however, also want there to be a second kind of payment that would be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.841" offset="9327613">And that kind of payment was known as an experience refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.729" offset="9347257">It reflects... it occurs only in contracts between one insurance company and another, like the kind that we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.548" offset="9378500">And that kind of provision allows the stream of premium income to be adjusted if the parties essentially miscalculated in how much income was going to be flowing over to the second company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.023" offset="9428341">And it adjusts that on the basis of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.608" offset="9438686">Now, the legislative history makes clear that even though dividends aren't deductible in full, these kinds of experience refunds are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.283" offset="9477452">And it deliberately chose to put language in the statute that would achieve that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.502" offset="9498350">And that language is copied virtually verbatim into the regulation that you're referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.389" offset="9521860">So, I think that read in light of the history of the problems that Congress had in mind that it identified and the specific language that it chose to solve them, it would be misconstruing the statute to stretch its language to cover a kind of payment that was never intended to be covered by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.094" offset="9748707">It never seemed to be bothered by the fact that the ceding commission goes to the person who is presumably the insurance policyholder, and it just left to the conclusion that these are currently deductible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.755" offset="10027277">But it really doesn't have a lot to do with the economic benefits that the reinsuring... the reinsurer pays for it when he pays a ceding commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.760" offset="10063326">In either case it's paying the ceding commission so that it can get a stream of future income arising out of a block of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.866" offset="10095718">For example, if in the assumption context the assuming reinsurance company contracted with some third party to deal with the policyholders... and, in fact, contracted with the initial insuring company and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.841" offset="10147649">"Look, continue as a manager for us for these policies, collect the premiums, pay them to us, pay the benefits, the policyholders never have to know about this. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.169" offset="10545024">I think the most basic response to that argument is that this really isn't an accounting question at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.018" offset="10632377">And that kind of fundamental classification decision is one that's drawn in the substantive sections of the Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.557" offset="10674487">If Petitioner's position were correct, then the NAIC could designate any kind of capital outlay as an immediately deductible expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.730" offset="10711267">And it might have good reason for doing it for NAIC purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.383" offset="10725791">It might feel that that better protects the solvency of the company for purposes of protecting the insurance policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.387" offset="10753795">But there would be no reason for Congress to have wanted to abdicate entirely all of the provisions of the Tax Code to the way the NAIC sets up its books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.595" offset="10798725">However, if this Court does view the question in this case as having something to do with Section 818, the accounting provisions, then there is a body of federal tax accounting doctrine that one can look at that determines that a payment made for future outlays is not an immediately deductible expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.009" offset="10880332">And that regulation, which is Regulation 1.461, is cited in our brief at page 39.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.088" offset="11396616">The problem with the Commissioner's argument is that it starts from the wrong premise and it goes in the wrong door and it's going to come out the wrong end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.110" offset="11432769">It starts from the premise that indemnity reinsurance is the acquisition of an asset, and in getting to that conclusion the Commissioner focuses on just one aspect of indemnity reinsurance, the right to future premium income assuming the policy stays in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.954" offset="11492119">This is what directly written insurance is all about as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.739" offset="11507270">There is an expectation of receiving future premium income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.774" offset="11519391">And yet it's not correct to focus only on that aspect of directly written insurance and cut it up, slice it up, and say, well, just because you have this future premium income that you expect to get, that somehow you're acquiring an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.665" offset="11566934">And it's no more correct to do that in indemnity reinsurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.547" offset="11654497">The reason why... what the counsel said was that the reason why directly written expenses are currently deductible is because of some provision in the Congressional legislative history of Part I, Subchapter L.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.104" offset="11708727">I do not agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.723" offset="11715205">If the reason why expenses incurred in directly written insurance are currently deductible is because the ordinary and necessary expenses under Section 162 and Section 818 says that unless contrary to accrual accounting rules, the NAIC accounting is to apply, and directly written expenses are currently deductible in NAIC accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.204" offset="11793155">The legislative history on which the counsel relies states as follows,</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.422" offset="11809977">"Small, new and growing life insurance companies are particularly likely to have underwriting losses because of the initial costs which they incur such as agents' commissions in placing new policies on their books. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.880" offset="11859819">Well, these are costs in this case which are incurred in placing new policies on the books of the indemnity reinsurer and the reference to "such as agents' commissions" is by no means an all-exclusive reference.</text>
