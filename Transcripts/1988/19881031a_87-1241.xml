            <text syncTime="70.877" offset="422574">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.017" offset="435113">The question in this case is whether a private party may sue a state for damages in federal court under the Superfund Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.920" offset="462698">Now, the parties have briefed and the case could present constitutional issues regarding the Eleventh Amendment and about the continuing vitality of this Court's decision in Hans v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.353" offset="508464">But the first issue is the statutory question of whether Congress intended to subject states to these kinds of actions, and if the Court agrees that Congress did not, then there is no need to reach those constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.255" offset="564053">When the Court of Appeals first looked at the Superfund Act, it found that the statute showed no evidence of a congressional intention to subject states to private liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.624" offset="613581">They found that the statute was very similar to that construed in the Employees of Missouri case, that is, states were literally included among the universe of possible defendants, but there was not the specific indicia that this Court has found necessary to override the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.993" offset="678992">When on remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals next looked at the statute, they looked at it in light of intervening amendments in an act known by its acronym as SARA, and in light of this Court's decision in Atascadero that to affect the Eleventh Amendment Congress must make itself clear, must express itself with unmistakable clarity in the words of the statute, and the Court of Appeals found that unmistakable clarity in the last clause of an exception to a provision that excludes state and local governments from liability under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.524" offset="825173">When you look at that amendment--</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Knorr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="188.518" offset="893091">The amendment is codified at Section 9601(20)(D), and when you look at it as a whole, it is apparent that it's not about the Eleventh Amendment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.559" offset="949307">What Congress was focusing on here was the very different and very narrow question of what do you do about a unit of government that has acquired a site involuntarily, because under Superfund as it was originally enacted, there is strict liability, and a unit of government could well find itself liable under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.802" offset="1034257">When the SARA amending act was going through the Senate, the Senate added a provision that would exclude government liability under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.640" offset="1073650">The amendments then went to a conference committee, and in the conference committee an exclusion or an exception to that exclusion was added which provided that even if a site was acquired involuntarily, if the government unit then did something to cause or contribute to the discharge of hazardous materials, there would then still be liability, and it's that provision that the Court of Appeals fastened upon and in which they felt Congress had, with unmistakable clarity, focused on the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.581" offset="1201336">There is, however, no explicit mention of the amendment in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.936" offset="1230802">There is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that Congress was even thinking about the Eleventh Amendment or the problems of government immunity in general--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="281.386" offset="1264553">So do you think unmistakable clarity means explicit reference to the Eleventh Amendment?</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Knorr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="286.477" offset="1284928">--I think in light of Atascadero, it would certainly be prudent, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is invariably necessary in every circumstance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="296.568" stopTime="305.721">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="296.568" offset="1325261">Well, what effect do you give to the second sentence of subparagraph (D) if it is not to impose liability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_knorr_iii" startTime="305.720" stopTime="369.695">
            <label>Mr. John G. Knorr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="305.720" offset="1361937">I think that is simply the kind of general liability language, which means that if the unit of government doesn't fit within the first sentence, that is, the exclusion of liability, we are then back to square one with the rest of the statute, and whatever would otherwise control under the statute controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.166" offset="1431736">I think if you look even in isolation at that last clause of the second sentence, the clause that begins "such a unit of government", you wouldn't find... what you'd find are the following characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.302" offset="1484295">You'd find no mention of the Eleventh Amendment or of state immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.926" offset="1498714">You find no mention of state liability to private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.315" offset="1520344">You find it is part of a statute which does explicitly mention federal liability, to which the Eleventh Amendment is, of course, no bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.715" offset="1557855">And you find that even this narrow clause of the statute incudes local governments as well as states.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.245" offset="1588053">Now, local governments, of course, don't have any Eleventh Amendment immunity, and it seems to me that this is not the kind of language--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="677.133" offset="2847573">Under that, Congress may undoubtedly abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity, but in the Article I context, the Court has in the past locked for some evidence of consent on the part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.753" offset="2882055">Now, the consent can be constructive rather than express.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.814" offset="2898251">Congress may act to induce consent, and Congress may act to define what will be construed as consent, but consent of some kind there has to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.999" offset="2939002">And I think it's important to remember that in this case Union Gas apparently concedes, because they haven't mentioned the issue in their brief, that nothing Pennsylvania did or is alleged to have done can be construed as consent to federal jurisdiction here because everything Pennsylvania is alleged to have done they did before the passage of the Superfund Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.601" offset="3021444">Union Gas doesn't rely on any theory of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.611" offset="3049447">Their theory is that consent is unnecessary and irrelevant, and they rely to support that argument on the idea that a unilateral ability to abrogate immunity is somehow necessary to vindicate Congress's Article I powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.543" offset="3109215">But this, I would say, is exactly the concern that this Court recognized and addressed in Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.165" offset="3143697">These kinds of Supremacy Clause concerns are exactly what the Court recognized and tried to accommodate in Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.474" offset="3180895">Young is the Court's effort to balance and accommodate the competing interests of state and national governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.971" offset="3206913">Union Gas's approach, the approach they advocate, reconciles, if you will, those competing interests by simply eliminating the legitimacy of the state side of that balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.170" offset="3255710">It's simply a principle of congressional supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.073" offset="3271384">And that, we submit, is not the proper approach for this kind of delicate constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.243" offset="3300014">They rely next, as we've already discussed a bit, on Fitzpatrick and on the principle that under its Fourteenth Amendment powers Congress may abrogate immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.737" offset="3354035">But what, Fitzpatrick says is that under the Fourteenth Amendment Congress may do what is constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.624" offset="3397503">Fitzpatrick in the Fourteenth Amendment is the exception that proves the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.512" offset="3413072">What they really seem to be suggesting here is that Fitzpatrick was wrongly decided, or at least was wrong in its rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.213" offset="3443896">But if you put... the Fourteenth Amendment is not just another addition, is not just another power given to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.583" offset="3485379">It's not just another limitation on what states may do.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.660" offset="3501679">It changes the very nature of the relationship between the states and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.689" offset="3525816">And it is for that reason, I think, that the Court felt that in order to vindicate that power, it was necessary that Congress be able to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.295" offset="3564269">But if the Fourteenth Amendment simply stands on the same footing as Article I, then what we are left looking for is some general principle that Congress may set aside what would otherwise be constitutional limitations whenever it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.335" offset="3620380">And I don't know of any support for that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.147" offset="3631664">We believe that Fitzpatrick was correctly decided, and also, that the analysis in Parden is correct and ought to remain a part of the Court's Eleventh Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.611" offset="3681506">Consent of some kind in this context is necessary, and consent is entirely, and I believe concededly absent in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.221" offset="6163975">Congress's purpose in achieving a comprehensive clean-up of contamination sites in the United States will be frustrated if an important participant in the cause of that contamination, the states, cannot be sued for damages by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.199" offset="6223847">In seeking affirmance of the result in the lower court, Union Gas urges this Court first to overrule Hans v. Louisiana or, absent that, to rule that Congress was authorized to, empowered and did abrogate state immunity from private suit in CERCLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.285" offset="6292184">Let me address Hans v. Louisiana first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.425" offset="6304722">Hans improperly extended the Eleventh Amendment to bar causes of actions well beyond its plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.141" offset="6331576">Hans was based on a pre-constitutional notion that states enjoyed sovereign immunity and that this was incorporated into the Constitution by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.075" offset="6371387">The Constitution, after all, was a compact of the people to form a nation and create a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.197" offset="6395837">It was a system of delegated powers in which the people surrendered much of the state's power to a national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.975" offset="6422900">The Constitution assumed the existence of the states by placing prohibitions on them, but it did not grant the states substantive sovereign rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.237" offset="6463965">The Constitution itself contains no express or implied grant of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.890" offset="6490610">The states did, however, retain sovereignty as to matters not delegated to the federal government, but at least as regards the Commerce Clause, state sovereignty was surrendered by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.276" offset="6540138">Essential to the constitutional framework was that the federal courts, this Court, would have the final say as to the Constitution, the federal laws, and the treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.896" offset="6582665">Thus, Article III of the Constitution defines jurisdiction of the federal courts in categories of subject matter as well as parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.284" offset="6616206">The federal courts, on one hand, were entrusted with being the interpreters of the Constitution, laws and treaties; and secondly, with being the neutral forum for diverse parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.467" offset="6664899">The notion that the states' compliance with the Constitution has to be enforced by private suits in civil, in federal courts is no stronger, it seems to me, than the notion that the federal government's compliance with the provisions of the Constitution has to be enforced by private suits in federal courts, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.952" offset="6958829">It may be then, Mr. Justice, you may be leading to this, that sovereign immunity itself is an outmoded concept; it's a relic of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.245" offset="6992056">And bear in mind... I know you're familiar with the academics and the history and the scholars in this area, but when the colonies were originally formed, most of their charters provided that they could sue and be sued in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.116" offset="7047540">And when the nation was formed under that Constitution, the states... the people gave up much of the rights of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.439" offset="7084843">And certainly the language of Article III, literally read, would indicate that they understood state citizen diversity as being one grounds, and a separate ground for jurisdiction in the federal courts, as well as federal subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.856" offset="7138446">What this leads up to, and I think it's appropriate to get to, is the Chisholm case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.713" offset="7157882">Chisholm presented the first test of federal court jurisdiction over an action against a state by a citizen of another state for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.990" offset="7194975">Now, the facts of Chisholm I know are well known to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.161" offset="7207723">They've been discussed in many of your decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.239" offset="7215978">What is important about Chisholm is that jurisdiction was predicated on the state citizen diversity clause of Article III which has codified by the Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.281" offset="7260177">I submit that Chisholm holding that the Court did have jurisdiction was a correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.451" offset="7280866">Justice Wilson and Attorney General Randolph who participated in the case had been members of the Committee of Detail that drafted Article III of the Constitution, and jurisdiction was consistent with the literal language of Article III and that Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.147" offset="7343664">It follows that the Eleventh Amendment adopted in 1794 which overturned Chisholm was a narrowly drawn jurisdiction preclusion clause which left untouched federal subject matter jurisdiction over the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.031" offset="7403119">If Congress had intended to grant the states sovereign immunity, certainly the last 14 words of the amendment were superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.841" offset="7434362">Those 14 words are remarkably congruent with the state citizen diversity clause of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.541" offset="7461215">Furthermore, if Congress had intended in the Eleventh Amendment to grant broad sovereign immunity to the states, then it would have restricted its own power to create private causes of action for individuals against the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.233" offset="11983952">And that is they seize on this exception in the SARA amendment to the definition of owner operator as being indication that states were not intended to be subject to suit under this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.195" offset="12047795">I submit that it's illogical to suggest that they can be liable for sites that are involuntarily acquired where they then cause the contamination but they can't be sued if they buy the property next door to me and contaminate it and it runs off onto my land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.952" offset="12130864">That's just an illogical interpretation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.717" offset="12141940">I think the logical interpretation is that there's general liability under Section 107 and that this definition provides one exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.978" offset="12502953">But the point that I've harped upon is that Congress must have its core powers unfettered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.332" offset="12540360">Those powers include the power under Article I, Section 8, which is the Commerce Clause, and that power... if Congress determines that in order to vindicate its power it must establish private damage remedies against parties that include states, then I submit that the constitutional scheme permits that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.072" offset="12651328">The other point I would make with regard to the statute is that within this scheme where the Congress had legislation that wasn't effectively cleaning up the contamination sites in this country, where in each of those acts it had provided for exemption for the states, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, each gave that broad exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.605" offset="12781418">But CERCLA, coming in 1980, did not and I submit that that is strong evidence of Congress's intention with regard to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.305" offset="12816213">And another strong indicia is the fact that the federal government waived its own liability, and it didn't just waive it in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.645" offset="12857591">It said as to the executive branch, the congressional branch and even this Court can be sued in federal court should it cause contamination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.626" offset="12889565">And the concept, the overriding concept is that we all need to pull together, we all need to clean up these sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.764" offset="12918091">It's a matter of the national health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.028" offset="12939197">In closing, I'd like to observe that sovereign immunity is a relic that has persisted in the law despite the law's evolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.525" offset="12965111">State sovereign immunity is not required by nor implied in our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.819" offset="12986322">And its persistence undermines basic tenets of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.365" offset="13000533">This is the first Eleventh Amendment case before this Court where there is no redress for the state's wrong unless the claim can be presented in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.205" offset="13035851">Congress's purpose in achieving a comprehensive clean-up of contamination sites in the United States will be frustrated if an important participant in the cause of that contamination, the states, cannot be sued for damages by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.105" offset="13091439">The means for permitting Union Gas to obtain redress is to overturn Hans v. Louisiana.</text>
