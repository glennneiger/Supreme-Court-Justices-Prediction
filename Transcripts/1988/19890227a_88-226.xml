            <text syncTime="288.983" offset="1303761">Precisely, Your Honor, indeed, if I can answer that in some depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.519" offset="1317867">That goes to the heart of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.487" offset="1325808">The testimony at trial was precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.206" offset="1340646">The city-hired sound consultant, Gary Floyd, has asked that both on direct and cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.027" offset="1363947">What he pointed out is that when you reflect the mix, you do it based on your technical knowledge and the knowledge that you obtain by talking to the performers, that this happens all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.234" offset="1408773">And that by doing sound checks in advance, sending out technical information to each of the performers and, in addition, by talking to them on the phone in advance of the concert and allowing the performer, if he desires, to set someone down next to you to give you the technical advice, you can reflect exactly what the mix is supposed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.731" offset="1494768">Indeed, that's precisely what the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.285" offset="1508979">And when Alan Thompson, who was the technician for RA, testified, he pointed out precisely that's the method he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.224" offset="1548790">Two things I would like to elaborate on in response to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.775" offset="1566971">First, one year they didn't even use Alan Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.013" offset="1579928">They rented out the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.196" offset="1584630">So, they used precisely the same type of program that we used.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.565" offset="1602079">The person came on, and he reflected the mix through the same process I just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.619" offset="1626321">In addition, Alan Thompson rented his equipment, and so... just as we rent our equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.373" offset="1649309">So, it was very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.825" offset="1655160">And finally--</text>

            <text syncTime="383.762" offset="1682850">The sound technician is merely a mechanic, and he can reflect, as the testimony shows, within five minutes precisely what the performer wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.151" offset="1716496">When Alan Thompson, RAR's technician, was asked how he achieves the mix, he said exactly what Gary Floyd said.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.356" offset="1753276">He speaks to the performer, he does a sound check at the beginning of the concert, and finally he allows the performers to have a technician at his side in order to reflect the concert.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.494" offset="1993812">And then he pointedly noted that there had been no evidence to indicate that the city could not reflect the mix properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.558" offset="2190044">But then the mix would have suffered because a technician is only as good as familiarity with his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.794" offset="2215017">If he is not familiar with the equipment, he can't do the job.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.682" offset="2230586">The other thing they thought about was negotiating a decibel level.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.468" offset="2245737">But they had tried that in 1984, indeed at the suggestion of RAR, and RAR, on the eve of a concert, did not agree to it and said that no decibel level would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.759" offset="2290876">Indeed, consistent with that, in the testimony by Alan Thompson, RAR's chief witness, when he was asked at what level it would be appropriate for the city to interfere with the concert, he said only when the audience's ears bleed, which gives you an idea of their reaction to any attempt on the part of the city to protect the unwilling listeners in the Sheep Meadow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.193" offset="13044653">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.726" offset="13054788">One of the problems with this case is that the Respondent has just carried his burden of going forward which he didn't do at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.749" offset="13086866">A lot of statements he made do not... are not reflected in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.184" offset="13100555">First, with respect to a decibel level, he indicated we never tried to negotiate a level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.755" offset="13122915">That is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.940" offset="13127617">At page 343 and 384, it says quite clearly that in 1984 we suggested a decibel level, which was precipitated by their inquiry as to whether or not we should have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.163" offset="13172444">And when we agreed to try it as a test, they didn't show up to try to revise it, and then took the position that any decibel level would violate their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.370" offset="13213299">So, we tried that alternative, and it was because of their stubbornness, not ours, that it wasn't given a fair test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.507" offset="13237854">Second, with respect to the mix itself, Gary Floyd, our sound consultant, did not say that the mix is part of the band.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.011" offset="13267843">At 180 to 181, what he specifically said was a good mixer can reflect the band's artistic inclinations within five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.136" offset="13304414">Second, Alan Thompson, the Plaintiff's own witness... I would like to just read this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.771" offset="13322909">It will only take a second, but it summarizes our case because he did not disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.658" offset="13342448">In asking to describe how he mixes at the board, he said specific--</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.225" offset="13448715">That's precisely what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.511" offset="13457910">And that is why the district court confirmed that we could reflect the mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.963" offset="13475673">With respect to the sound itself as to why we didn't set a decibel level, that was one of the options considered by our consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.419" offset="13509528">But the reason he didn't set a general decibel level is because it varies based on foliage, temperature and crowds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.239" offset="13536799">And, therefore, a decibel level for each... for each event would not be appropriate and it may not even be appropriate for the very event you set ore because the crowds keep forming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.696" offset="13578595">As the crowds get larger, the decibel level would have to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.998" offset="13591866">And, therefore, there would be no objective standard they could count on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.034" offset="13607957">Finally, with respect to the separate volume control, which has now come up as a suggestion because it was mentioned by the Second Circuit, that was never mentioned up to the point of the decision of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.575" offset="13654142">No one ever suggested a separate volume control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.394" offset="13665426">And, in fact, such a control would cause more problems than it would solve because a control such as that would have to be hooked into each mixer that was brought to the many concerts held at the bandshell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.934" offset="13711611">As a consequence, those mixers would have to be compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.303" offset="13725090">To the extent that the mixers are not compatible, we would not be able to offer the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.457" offset="13745675">Second, if you did have a separate volume control, far and away from the mixer, basically what you could have is competing controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.111" offset="13776290">Each time we lowered the sound, an individual at the mixing board would be able to manipulate his portion through the amplifiers and nullify the competing controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.319" offset="13813071">Finally, in addition, by having a separate volume control, it would cause a signal loss in the mixer and could upset the balance of the mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.156" offset="13844417">So, frankly, that particular solution would actually affect the esthetics, and it would... should be the least desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.328" offset="13873152">And that is why the city chose the method it did and why it was accepted by every person that used it for... in the year 1986.</text>
