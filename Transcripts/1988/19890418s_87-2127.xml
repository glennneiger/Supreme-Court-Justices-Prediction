            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86568">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 87-2127, American Foreign Service Association versus Garfinkel.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.741" offset="121468">In this case, the District Court invalidated Section 630 of an Act of Congress dealing with disclosure agreements by Executive Branch employees as an impermissible interference with the President’s authority to regulate the disclosure of national security information.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.533" offset="192625">In a subsequent ruling, it held that the Executives’ use of the term "classifiable" was impermissibly vague and ordered the executive to discontinue use of this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.665" offset="233167">In light of this development, a portion of appellant’s lawsuit is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.725" offset="249468">Other questions, however, may remain, and in their current posture of best resolved in the first instance by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.815" offset="277784">We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
