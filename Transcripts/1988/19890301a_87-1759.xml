            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="129991">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1759, Texas State Teachers Association v. Garland Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.439" offset="175653">Mr. Chanin?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_chanin" startTime="14.308" stopTime="360.699">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Chanin</label>
            <text syncTime="14.308" offset="187147">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.443" offset="199686">The question presented by this case concerns the standard to be used in determining whether a plaintiff is a prevailing party for purposes of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Awards Act, Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.102" offset="250363">The parties urge two alternative standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.804" offset="265201">The Respondents contend that the correct standard is the one used by the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.458" offset="291741">It is referred to as the central issue standard under which a plaintiff must prevail on the central issue by acquiring the primary relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.933" offset="333642">On the basis of this standard, the court below held the Petitioners in this case were not prevailing parties and, therefore, ineligible for any fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.372" offset="375438">The standard urged by Petitioners was initially articulated by the First Circuit in Nadeau v. Heigemoe in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.846" offset="413367">It is currently used by courts of appeal in 11 circuits, and it was characterized by this Court as a typical formulation in Hensley v. Eckerhart in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.987" offset="461851">It is referred to as the significant issue standard which establishes plaintiffs as prevailing parties if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefits the parties sought in bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.164" offset="522559">Let me note at the outset that the question as to the correct standard for prevailing party status does not in and of itself relate directly to the amount of fees that ultimately should be awarded to a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.506" offset="583999">The standard at issue here is only the first stage of a two-stage process.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.010" offset="610017">It is a threshold standard to establish an eligibility for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.647" offset="632482">If a plaintiff succeeds in crossing that threshold, the actual amount of fees to which he is entitled is determined by the district court after considering various factors, particularly the degree of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.859" offset="701341">To put this another way, there is no dispute here about the fact that the results obtained is a crucial factor in the application of Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.833" offset="753273">The dispute concerns the stage of the process at which this factor should have its primary impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.606" offset="784411">Should it be at the threshold eligibility stage to deny prevailing party status to a partially prevailing plaintiff and totally preclude any fee award, which is the Respondents' position?</text>
            <text syncTime="178.949" offset="845746">Or should it have its primary impact at the second stage after prevailing party status has been achieved in determining the amount of reasonable fees in light of the results obtained?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.125" offset="902484">This is the Petitioners' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.160" offset="914605">In order to establish a framework for addressing this question, it is appropriate to begin with a brief review of the facts in this case, particularly since the briefs of the Respondents and their supporting amici present such a distorted picture of the merits outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.289" offset="991091">This case involves a regulation adopted by a public school district in Texas, the Garland Independent School District... I'll refer to it as GISD... which prohibited all communications regarding employee organizations on school grounds at any time during the school day, including teachers' lunch break, non-class periods and other free time.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.606" offset="1096313">The regulation covered face-to-face discussions and also prohibited any use of the school district's communications facilities, bulletin boards, teachers' mailboxes, PA systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.116" offset="1150438">Those were all precluded to disseminate any information regarding employee organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.936" offset="1177710">This prohibition applied to communications by and among the teachers themselves, as well as the communications by outside representatives of employee organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.045" offset="1234135">The Petitioners filed a 1983 action and succeeded in having the regulation struck down as it applied to teacher-to-teacher communications and as it applied to the GISD's communications facilities by the teachers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.574" offset="1304247">We were unsuccessful in regard to the prohibition against communications by outside representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.097" offset="1338311">We considered this to be a significant victory, and judging by the vigorous efforts of the Respondents to overturn the ruling, so did they.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.737" offset="1384913">They left no stone unchallenged in seeking to reverse this ruling, including ultimately an appeal to this Court which summarily affirmed the Fifth Circuit on the merits in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.497" offset="1443950">In the course of its efforts to reverse, the Respondents did something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.132" offset="1466415">They also made clear what this ruling meant in practical terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.620" offset="1488463">They repeatedly emphasized before the lower courts and, indeed, before this Court that invalidation of the teacher portion of the regulation would require substantial modification on the school district's policies and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.414" offset="1559620">And that is, in fact, what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.241" offset="1618866">As you say, you prevailed on one issue in the district court concerning the use of school premises during non-school hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.113" offset="1654393">Now, the district court termed that issue minor since it said there was no evidence that union representatives were ever denied access to teachers during non-school hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.439" offset="1707682">Now, if we were to agree with you on the appropriate test, that any significant issue test that you propose, do you think that that degree of success would entitle you to fees under that test?</text>

            <text syncTime="408.949" offset="1765779">Well, Your Honor, I think you're referring to a... a minor point of victory in this case, and the answer to your question is it would fall below the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.888" offset="1801514">But let me clarify what I am talking about as our victory and what I think you are referring to.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.426" offset="1823666">In the course of this broad-based regulation that we challenged, there was a provision that said meetings could be held before school opened, 8:00 a.m. In the morning, and after school at 3:45.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.533" offset="1876120">And it said that it would be up to the school principal to determine whether or not to grant access for those meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.003" offset="1901929">That was the only thing struck down by the district court as too vague because there were no standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1928051">That was not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.893" offset="1933485">It had no practical impact because the record indicates we never had been denied a pre-school or post-school meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.884" offset="2389478">Because if you focused on the word "the" and you said there can only be one prevailing party, I suggest it would be a far too rigid and wooden reading of the statute inconsistent with numerous prior holdings of this Court, inconsistent with the legislative history as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.732" offset="2472861">Both this Court and the legislative history have made it clear that fee awards are appropriate pendente lite, at an interim stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.122" offset="2518419">And they made those references in the course of complex institutional civil rights cases which are ongoing, where issues change, where... where objectives and goals change as the litigation goes on.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.294" offset="3995069">Well, Your Honor, I think it's absurd because I think it's directly contrary... what you suggest is directly contrary to the intent of Congress in passing Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.219" offset="4038850">As this Court observed very recently, last week, in Blanchard, in order to advance Congress' purpose under... enacting Section 1988 civil rights attorneys should be encouraged to explore all possible avenues of relief in their efforts to vindicate the high priority policies of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.615" offset="4120352">And the Court cautioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.567" offset="4128189">It cautioned against artificial incentives that could skew the way civil rights cases are structured and put forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.654" offset="4160580">We submit that based upon what you have said, the central issue standard would create an economic disincentive which could have precisely that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.862" offset="4201436">It could cause and deter civil rights attorneys from providing the type of effective representation that this Court called for in Blanchard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.052" offset="4238112">Because of the inherent difficulty in determining what is the central issue and the uncertainty as to what some courts may hold in that regard, the economic self-interest of the attorneys could motivate them to press only those claims which look like sure-fire winners or have a strong likelihood of success and abandon issues that are somewhat more problematic even though they are bona fide, can be supported by a good faith argument for an extension or modification or even a reversal of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.391" offset="4375516">If you included those issues in your hypothetical, we run the risk that we wilt lose all fees even for those issues on which we are successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.747" offset="4420969">I think this possibility is not a positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.318" offset="4435180">I think it distorts artificially the way civil rights attorneys would prepare, present and handle cases, be contrary to this Court's admonition in the Blanchard case and be contrary to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.244" offset="4494948">The significant issue standard avoids that problem and would not, as your question may also imply, encourage the inclusion of non-meritorious or insubstantial claims in civil rights lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.837" offset="4553253">I think the framework that this Court has established for applying Section 1988 provides ample safeguards against that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.526" offset="4596094">Thus, for example, if we assert issues and include issues that are unreasonable or groundless, we may be required under Christiansburg to pay the fees to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.202" offset="4646771">I submit to you that is a powerful deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.987" offset="4661922">Moreover, under Hensley, even as prevailing plaintiffs, we may be denied fees for time spent on non-frivolous issues raised in good faith, but we did not succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.562" offset="4716153">This is a further incentive for plaintiffs attorneys to consider very carefully the kinds of issues they include.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.401" offset="4747500">But there is a major difference between the concepts embodied in Christiansburg and the concepts embodied in Hensley which are designed to motivate responsible action by attorneys for civil rights plaintiffs and the central issue standard which threatens to impose a financial penalty for providing precisely the type of effective representation that Congress intended and this Court has called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.670" offset="4868603">Let me, if I may, pick up on Hensley v. Eckerhart because we believe and most courts of appeals believe that that case resolved this question and put to bed the question of the standard to be applied in determining who was a prevailing party for purposes of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.385" offset="4959509">The issue in Hensley was whether prevailing... a party who had prevailed in part could recover legal fees for the services rendered on unsuccessful claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.177" offset="5006634">In answering that question, Hensley established a comprehensive analytical framework to assure that civil rights plaintiffs obtain fee awards that are reasonable in relation to the results obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.055" offset="5074135">The framework involved a two-stage process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.924" offset="5089599">A plaintiff who achieves only partial or limited success must first cross what this Court termed the generous eligibility threshold to become a prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.898" offset="5141531">And it is appropriate for that threshold to be generous because it is only the first stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.920" offset="5169638">The determination of what amount is reasonable is made by the district court, taking into account relevant factors including particularly the level of success achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.912" offset="5221570">There are several examples in Hensley itself which illustrate the application of that analytical approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.251" offset="5250931">Take Hensley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.651" offset="5256574">Hensley was a broad-based challenge to the constitutionality of treatment and conditions at a state mental hospital involving six general areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.408" offset="5299519">The Court indicated hypothetically that even if the plaintiffs prevailed in regard to only one of those areas, visitation, mail and telephone policies, which hardly would seem to constitute the central issue in the case, that those plaintiffs would have been prevailing parties eligible for a fee award, although the Court did say that the amount would be reduced at the second stage to reflect the work done on unsuccessful claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.578" offset="5420205">Hensley's discussion of the Eighth Circuit's decision in Brown v. Bathke is equally explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.481" offset="5447895">There you had a discharged school teacher, sought reinstatement, lost wages, damages, and expungement from her record of the negative material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.289" offset="5495124">She achieved only lost wages and expungement, lost on the reinstatement, lost on the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.895" offset="5525531">But this Court said that that plaintiff was the prevailing party eligible for a fee even though... and I quote from the Court's opinion in Hensley...</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.370" offset="5567431">"she had lost on the major issue of reinstatement and obtained only a minor part of the relief she sought. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.308" offset="5603167">And these examples come as no surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.677" offset="5616646">They are the natural outgrowth of what Hensley establishes for assuring that civil rights plaintiffs receive reasonable fees in light of the results obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.549" offset="5660113">And as this case illustrates, the central issue standard simply does not fit within that framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.389" offset="5691460">If we are to obtain reasonable fees for the significant results we obtained, having the GISD regulation declared unconstitutional as to teachers, we must in the first instance be allowed to cross over that eligibility threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.266" offset="5758961">That would allow the district court to have an opportunity to do, as the Justice suggests, to calculate under Hensley the amount of fees that are reasonable in light of what we achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.074" offset="5810265">The use of the central issue test has foreclosed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.043" offset="5826148">It has foreclosed the discretion of the district court, and it has denied us the opportunity to recover any fees even though we have vindicated the policies of Congress by achieving substantial secondary success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.120" offset="5882468">The Respondents, we would submit to you, entirely missed the point of Hensley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.107" offset="5902321">Instead of looking at the reasoning and the analysis, which clearly preclude the central issue test, they focus instead on the opening paragraph where the Court refers to significant issue standard as "typical and generous".</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.616" offset="5968358">But admittedly, it does not say in so many words this is the only standard that can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.489" offset="5999914">Limiting themselves to that one isolated paragraph, Respondents suggest that even if the Court accepts the significant issue standard, that does not preclude the use of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.363" offset="6047353">The Fifth Circuit would be free, while some use significant issue, to continue to use central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.552" offset="6076192">But this argument is wrong even on its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.254" offset="6090925">The definition of prevailing party is a matter of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.158" offset="6110569">There can be only one standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.026" offset="6126033">The question is what did Congress intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.728" offset="6140871">And it is not to be left to the discretion of each court of appeals to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.316" offset="6167202">If the significant issue standard accurately reflects the intent of Congress, which we submit is the teaching of Hensley, it cannot be that the Fifth or the Tenth or the Ninth or any other circuit is free to adopt a markedly narrower, less generous standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.729" offset="6248809">Let me pick up one other point, another teaching of Hensley and of other cases, and that is that fee applications should not result in a second major litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.155" offset="6302517">Ideally, once the merits are determined, the parties should settle without further burden on Judicial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.109" offset="6334386">I submit to you that the central issue test cuts against both points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.149" offset="6358523">It encourages further litigation and it deters settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.934" offset="6377645">The basic reason for this is the inherent difficulty involved in many cases in determining what is the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.689" offset="6416724">By its very nature that is a complex inquiry that requires the court to determine post hoc the goals and the motives of plaintiffs in initially bringing a lawsuit, to arrange in some type of hierarchical order the relative importance of the issues which the plaintiff has brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.370" offset="6499375">This case proves the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.572" offset="6508257">This is a relatively straightforward and simple case, but the fee application spawned further litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.678" offset="6540649">Petitioners contended in district court that we did prevail on the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.331" offset="6559248">We said the central issue was can this school district preclude all communication, we lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.889" offset="6613478">We briefed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.091" offset="6618285">We argued it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.270" offset="6599059">When the district court ruled against us, we appealed to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.191" offset="6622673">So, it spawned further litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.293" offset="6635108">Consider how much more difficult the problem would be of identifying the central issue in complex institutional civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.482" offset="6671888">Take Hensley, for example, which involves six related issues involving treatment and conditions at a state mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.838" offset="6705325">What was the central issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.957" offset="6717759">And how much Judicial time and resources would have been necessary to make that determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.126" offset="6742419">Suppose four of the issues in Hensley were of equal centrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.245" offset="6758928">What's the formula?</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.764" offset="6764989">Do we have to win on two plus to meet the central issue test?</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.584" offset="6784319">There is no need to belabor the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.350" offset="6999359">There is virtually no incentive for me as a defendant to settle under the central issue test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl Luna</label>
            <text syncTime="1770.918" offset="7213563">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.870" offset="7229446">I think it would be helpful for us to look at some of the facts that counsel didn't cover here and that is that the Texas legislature had passed a statute that... 21.904 of the Texas Education Code... that said no school district, board of education, superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal or other administrator benefiting by funds provided for in this code shall directly or indirectly require or coerce any teacher to join any group, club, committee, organization or... or association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.793" offset="7365073">As a result of that, the school board passed this regulation which simply said that you won't promote these organizations during school hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.702" offset="7424737">And the reason for that is that there are administrators... there are administrators who belong to the organization, just like there are other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.575" offset="7464234">So, if we had a policy that said administrators can call meetings and talk to people about joining the association and... and recruiting members, we'd be in violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.902" offset="7517524">Now, they didn't attack the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.668" offset="7524629">The state law is not attacked in this lawsuit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.389" offset="7539467">So, as the law was passed and the regulations begin to be established this case... he says it was one that could be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.345" offset="7583353">This was brought as a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.763" offset="7588995">They brought in... and the record here shows nine of their... what they call uniserve people from all over the state and descended upon 46 schools in this school district and covered most of them in a period of two days in groups of one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.091" offset="7666318">And they made demands during the school day to talk to the teachers, said they had a First Amendment right of assembly and speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.549" offset="7704143">And we took many depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.501" offset="7715950">He talks about the amount of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.868" offset="7725459">All of these people were outside association members except one of these nine people that made this trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.392" offset="7767464">One of them was one of our teachers, but we took depositions of all of the eight others and of many, many principals in preparing for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.200" offset="7810722">Now, none at those... if he had brought... if he had brought a lawsuit just for the part that he's talking about, those... eight of those nine wouldn't have been there because that wouldn't have been important to this case to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.108" offset="7858370">But by bringing it this way, it's an attempt to build a great fee perhaps like the one in the Riverside case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.030" offset="7894105">And we believe that that's not the intent of the legislation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.450" offset="7923780">Now, as they... as they went to the... as the depositions showed they were asked is there anything else that you claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.575" offset="7968189">Now, they set out some specific things in their complaint that they complained about, but they didn't set out... and it didn't show up until summary judgment... this portion about the discussion of teacher to teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.685" offset="8028688">Now, and even in their motion for summary judgment, they said it wasn't clear what the school's position was on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.857" offset="8065364">Now, the only information they have... and we think, by the way, there is a question as to whether there could be a prevailing party in this case under any circumstances because this is little more than what this Court has referred to as an advisory opinion because we were talking about things in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.258" offset="8162958">None of these things had happened, and they arose in a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.143" offset="8178527">What if somebody said so and so?</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.412" offset="8191588">So, there had been no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.030" offset="8202037">There was no case in controversy between the parties on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.101" offset="8222308">And these what-if questions were asked of some down-the-totem-pole administrators who were not policy makers of the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.075" offset="8274239">And, of course, this Court has recently held that it's... it has got to be something... it has got to be a policy maker that makes the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.447" offset="8311751">Therefore, there couldn't have been any liability on the school district for the mistaken belief, if it was mistaken belief, of some of these administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.787" offset="8345083">And under McCluskey, of course, the... the school board itself is the one who would interpret its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.726" offset="8380819">They really didn't take the school board's deposition, but they did take the superintendent's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.296" offset="8399104">And they asked him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.746" offset="8404956">In his deposition, he said that we don't have any regulation that keeps teachers from talking to each other about TSTA at lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.318" offset="8435258">We don't have any regulation that keeps them from talking about it on their break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.770" offset="8453021">Now, as I say, they did ask in deposition some of the other principals, well, what if this happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.091" offset="8478308">Well, I don't know, but I guess it would be a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.710" offset="8488757">And that speculation is the only thing that is in this record that they claim to have gotten relief on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.347" offset="8619369">I think there probably are a majority of the other courts of appeals that have said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.668" offset="8644655">But let me just move, if I might, then to that central issue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.155" offset="8662523">And the reason we think that the... first of all, in Ruckelshaus, we think this Court didn't adopt the First Circuit's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.344" offset="8703274">The Court simply referred to that First Circuit rule as a very generous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.165" offset="8722605">And the Court also referred to a number of other rules that were in use in the circuit including the Fifth Circuit rule of the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.370" offset="8763460">And I think it might be well to look at where that Fifth Circuit rule came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.757" offset="8788956">It came right out of the congressional history of this very statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.946" offset="8817691">In the congressional history in this statute when Dorothy Parker... Parker v. Matthews... brought a suit in district court in the District of Columbia, the case was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.842" offset="8889266">And then in the district court's opinion, it discussed, first, what's a prevailing party and... and what's the criteria for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.763" offset="8928972">And the district court in that case said... they brought up the central issue, said the central issue is the way you tell a prevailing party, and had a good deal of discussion on it, but noted there are no cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.190" offset="8990726">And they came up with... from... and took it from a Black Law Dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.027" offset="9010056">Now, the committee in the congressional history mentioned that case when they talked about the prevailing party and the central issue and how you set attorney fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.786" offset="9073064">Now, the Petitioners here say, oh, but they only mentioned... they only cited that case because it was settled to show that there could be a recovery for settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.411" offset="9119562">That's not the reason they mentioned that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.630" offset="9128443">That case went up on appeal and was affirmed in Parker v. Califano.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.934" offset="9153625">Now, if the Court had just been wanting to note that it mentioned the settlement, they could have cited the court of appeals case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.456" offset="9187793">They cited three cases in... in the congressional history on... at that point including another circuit court case which also talked about settlement, but did not discuss central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.799" offset="9241083">The only one of them that cited... that discussed the central issue was the district court case in Parker v. Matthews, which was later Parker v. Califano.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.107" offset="9290402">And the... we think that the reason they didn't cite the court of appeals is, as I say, on appeal they didn't discuss the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.011" offset="9321958">But the... the committee was well aware of the central issue and talked in terms of it's something to protect people who have a valid civil rights case, and... and it is not something to build attorney fees for attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.501" offset="9563957">If so, the plaintiff is going to recover, and it would be at most some offset under... under this Court's decisions where we said that you've got to... you can only recover for the work that you've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.979" offset="9633860">It might be an offset, but certainly no recovery for the defendant if the plaintiff recovered on the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.367" offset="9659356">I see no reason for the plaintiff to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.002" offset="9673984">Now, if we take a look then at why would the Court in a case like this now say that Hensley v. Eckerhart did not foreclose the issue and decide it... that's what Petitioners claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.171" offset="9790595">Yet, this Court two or three months later, that... after deciding Hensley v. Eckerhart on May 16, 1983, decided Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.514" offset="9852035">And in that case where the statute was different and said that the Court could set attorney fees where appropriate, they... the Court said that that is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.325" offset="9919222">This Court said that is different from the standard that is used in the prevailing issue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.915" offset="9957570">But even then the Court says there has to be some recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.835" offset="9981289">There has to be some prevailing in order... in order for them to recover it, but not as much as in a statute with the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.127" offset="10022458">So, if this was a suit that was brought under the EPA statute, the plaintiffs might be in a different position that they're in here because this Court noticed that there was a difference in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.517" offset="10075957">And those... and if the prevailing issue was decided, there wouldn't have been any need for the distinction that was mace in the Ruckelshaus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.158" offset="10122559">Now, we think also that there is... another very, very important thing has developed in this case or failed to developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.300" offset="10163101">After the Fifth Circuit made its decision on the merits of this case the first time, the Fifth Circuit said that if that statute... if that regulation was decided as... as somebody might say that in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.665" offset="10256620">If it was decided that way, it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.765" offset="10264979">Now, they reversed then in part and remanded for... for further proceedings and not inconsistent with the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.723" offset="10312835">They did... on the holding then that if it was done that way, it would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.977" offset="10329867">Now, it was reversed for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.495" offset="10343869">And that's the time when it was appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.047" offset="10358079">It was rather suspected that the Petitioners in this case would, when it got back to the district court, ask as they had in their... in their petition originally maybe for nominal damages or for an injunction to keep it from being enforced that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.396" offset="10455568">Now, the plaintiffs, though, apparently recognized that there was really no merit and that they had really gotten nothing from the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.954" offset="10501753">So, when we got back to the district court, they don't ask for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.124" offset="10526412">They didn't ask for any further relief except attorney fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.175" offset="10622647">Now, the... the Fifth Circuit held that it was unconstitutional in a very limited way, that if it kept... where it kept the teachers from talking to each other about organizations, time off and so forth, that under those circumstances, the Fifth Circuit said it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.706" offset="10724734">Now, the Fifth Circuit disagreed--</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.496" offset="10759947">They said that there was no testimony to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.031" offset="10774053">They said there was no testimony to show that the administrators would not enforce it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.887" offset="10809475">So, I don't believe they said it was unconstitutional on its face, only as applied... if applied in that hypothetical manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.826" offset="10841240">There was... there was no holding that it was unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.612" offset="10856391">Now, so based on the... see, the... the Fifth Circuit applied the summary judgment rule most favorable to them, and... and then still affirmed the summary judgment except in that narrow area, and then turned around, using the same standard, and granted a partial summary judgment for them on that as applied theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.245" offset="10954925">But when we got back, after it was appealed to this Court, they didn't ask for any more relief, only for attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.149" offset="10982510">And the court again found that they didn't recover anything, and that they were not entitled to attorney fees and the... the court costs were attacked... were taxed against the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.742" offset="11044891">And on appeal, they didn't at that time challenge that portion of the court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.979" offset="11069864">So, we think then that that brings it very close to the facts of Hewitt v. Helms where the plaintiff didn't recover anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.441" offset="11131722">Now, the difference in... in this one and Helms, of course, was that in the Helms case, the Court had instructed them to enter a summary judgment on damages unless there has some immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.950" offset="11193789">Now, they didn't get that summary judgment entered when it went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.569" offset="11212179">And this Court pointed out in that case that at the end of the rainbow lies not a judgment, but some action for... or cessation of action by the defendant that the judgment produces the payment of damages or some specific performance or the termination of some conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.868" offset="11305384">Now, we had even applied to stay that first order while we appealed up here to this Court so it wouldn't go back to the district court and... what we feared... ask for some affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.646" offset="11368495">And then after this Court denied the appeal and it got back to the district court, they still didn't ask for any affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.633" offset="11400469">So, we believe that this case comes right in the decision of the Hewitt case because there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.393" offset="11459506">There wasn't any dispute between the parties on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.928" offset="11469642">This has something that had not happened, but the Fifth Circuit says, if it does, there's no evidence that you wouldn't enforce it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.118" offset="11502451">So, there really had never been a dispute on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.235" offset="11514886">Therefore, it... they... there was no dispute which affects the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.608" offset="11548322">Now, there would have been while this case was being appealed had they applied to the district court for injunctive relief and gotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.281" offset="11587088">We would have had to change the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.249" offset="11594925">But they didn't do that, and they didn't do it after the appeal is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.285" offset="11611121">So, as the posture of the case is before this Court, they received no judgment that affected any action that any of the parties to this case have to take... or that is, that the defendant has to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.896" offset="11681547">No action at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.181" offset="11686667">No order was entered by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.883" offset="11697429">And it's not a place to complain about here, but the interesting thing about it was the... the circuit court disagreed with the findings of fact of the trial court and made some findings notwithstanding--</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.925" offset="11853642">Under this regulation, they could... could put a stamp on it and send anything they wanted to to the teachers through the intra-school mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.066" offset="11906200">Now, they don't want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.368" offset="11915395">They wanted to take it all to the superintendent's office and have it delivered through the intra-school mail to the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.272" offset="11942980">Now, of course, since then, this Court has heard the... and decided the case of Regents versus...

            <text syncTime="2974.787" offset="12029080">So, part of their case of what they claimed to win is out the window because of the University of California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.976" offset="12069831">So, we think that the Petitioners have not shown that they have made any recovery in this case that changed any conduct of... or required the change of any conduct of the defendant that the defendant was carrying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.872" offset="12145377">Now, they will say, yes, you can't stop the teachers from talking to each other at lunch about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.025" offset="12166066">Now, the testimony showed we never tried to stop them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.329" offset="12183307">And you can't stop them from talking and... during the classroom... or during their off-period when they're not working.</text>
