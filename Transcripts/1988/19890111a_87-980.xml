            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="181850">Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="51.433" offset="344750">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="370036">Only ten years have passed since this Court's ruling in United States v. John, where the Mississippi courts were attempting to apply state laws to Indians within the territorial jurisdiction of the... of the Choctaw Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.512" offset="425103">At stake in that case was not simply the Indian country status of the reservation lands, but ultimately the legal existence of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians as a tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.784" offset="470242">Despite this Court's unanimous ruling in John vindicating the tribe's rights to a separate jurisdiction, now a decade later, Mississippi courts are once again seeking to apply state laws to Choctaw Indians of the Choctaw reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="526562">At stake this time is potentially not simply the future existence of the Appellant, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, but the future existence of Indian tribes nationwide as identifiable cultural entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.351" offset="572433">The issues before this Court arose within the context of the state adoption proceeding, a non-Indian white couple from down on the coast petitioned a state court to adopt twin full-blooded Choctaw Indian babies immediately following their birth at an off-reservation hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.147" offset="643695">Both the natural mother and the putative father in this case were and still are resident and domiciled on the Choctaw Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.169" offset="675774">Quite simply, the mother left for the short period of approximately ten days for the purpose of giving birth, signing over the children for adoption and returning to the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.399" offset="760619">Well, supposing this were a case that didn't involve Indian tribes, but involved people in California, say, getting a divorce from one another and the State of Nevada felt very strongly, since they had been both domiciled in Nevada, that Nevada courts should have had jurisdiction rather than the California courts, do you think the State of Nevada by itself could come before us and say, well, the California courts had no jurisdiction here, they should have done it in Nevada?</text>

            <text syncTime="211.418" offset="984750">We're alleging that the children were wrongfully taken from the tribe, and therefore they... they have suffered a wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.106" offset="1015470">Well, I suppose you could say the Tenth Amendment gives the State of Nevada a vested interest, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.993" offset="1035010">I mean, does the tribe have any more interest in the ability to apply its laws by virtue of this statute than the states do by virtue of... of our constitutional structure?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.736" offset="1098017">The distinction would be that the... the Tenth Amendment provides that all powers not vested are reserved to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.043" offset="1139186">Now, in this particular case the powers were specifically... or the power to regulate Indian affairs was vested by the Constitution in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.916" offset="1178683">And Congress, in turn, has by statute conferred a protected interest in the tribe in the future of its children.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.922" offset="1210761">As the statute says that they are of paramount importance to the future of the tribe itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.566" offset="5833285">And I think that that is one of the problems that Congress is trying to address in this legislation is the fact that the social studies have... have proven that the children who are removed from their Indian homes and Indian environments and Indian culture invariably, as they reach the teenage years, the overwhelm... a disproportionately large number of these children suffer extreme identity problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.419" offset="5952717">The rate of suicide among these Indian children is double what it is children at the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.740" offset="5978004">And the incidence of violence and drug abuse and so forth are likewise far in excess with the... with the children who are placed in non-Indian homes as compared with those who are born and reared... are reared on the reservation in an Indian environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.665" offset="6045713">So, I believe that Congress and the legislative history of the legislation shows that there was a thorough inquiry made into this area and that this was a reasoned decision on the part of Congress for the protection of these various interests involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.504" offset="6393037">And I believe that that's why they were citing the Wakefield v. Littlelight decision and the Greybull case and the Potowatomy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.027" offset="6427205">As far as the legislative history on this goes, the initial draft of the Indian Child Welfare Act with the section which is comparable now to 101(a) of the Act or 1911 stated... and I'll quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.085" offset="6479450">"For purposes of this Act, an Indian child shall be deemed to be a resident of the reservation where his parent or parents is resident. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.190" offset="6511842">And that's in 124 Cong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.492" offset="6525008">, Part 19, at Page 37, 224 of November 4, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.213" offset="6543921">So, at least in the very initial draft of this statute, it was very clearly intended by Congress that a minor child would acquire at law the residence and domicile of its Indian parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.021" offset="6591150">And there is nothing in the legislative history elsewhere that ever indicates a conscious decision to depart from this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.925" offset="6618735">In addition, the legislative history said that it can... in reference to the Wisconsin Potowatomies case and the Wakefield and the Greybull decision, stated that they can form the developing federal and state case law holding that the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction when the child is residing or domiciled on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.521" offset="6705148">And again, all of these cases entailed the application of the rule that a minor would acquire the residence and domicile at law of its natural parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.527" offset="6741197">And in some of these cases, the children were off the reservation and the parents were on reservation, and the court in those decisions did affix the on-reservation residence and domicile to the natural child and did so... and in the process of doing so, they divested the state of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.989" offset="6810996">So, we're not coming in here with a unique or a novel rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.142" offset="6835656">We're simply saying that this is an old standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.313" offset="6856345">This is a practice standard in all other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.998" offset="6867003">This has been the practice standard in the State of Mississippi up until this specific case, and I submit that the decision of the Mississippi court was an attempt to divest the tribe of jurisdiction expressly conferred by Section 1911(a) of the Indian Child Welfare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.258" offset="6932100">It was also an attempt to imply... to apply their standard of law to the reservation and to Indians of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.197" offset="6967836">And I believe and I maintain that this is simply in so many... all too many respects a rehash of the John decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.152" offset="7003676">Mississippi courts are once again trying to divest the tribes of their lawful jurisdiction over their citizens of their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.777" offset="7042128">And I submit that this is precluded by the Indian Child Welfare Act, and I believe that this Court has also indicated that it was precluded by the Fisher v. District Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.668" offset="7089775">I might note that in the Fisher v. District Court decision, this Court noted such things as the birth of a child off reservation were minimal and that therefore they would be disregarded in determining that the... the reservation did have exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.646" offset="7169605">And I submit that the... the simple act... the Mississippi court makes such a big point of these children having... or of this mother having gone to what they call great lengths to give birth to these children off reservation, when the reality is that all children of the Choctaw reservation and approximately 90 percent of the Indian children of this nation are born off of reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.630" offset="7469596">I would first like to say that the reason for the ICWA, the Indian Child Welfare Act, was a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.604" offset="7517452">It was designed, as the preamble states, to prevent the breakup of Indian families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.841" offset="7538454">And it was designed also to prevent the involuntary taking of Indian children by non-Indian parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.281" offset="7572205">And the statute recognizes this, and Congress recognized this and... by establishing two proceedings under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.487" offset="7613060">Under Section 1911, which surely will be mentioned several more times before this proceeding ends... under 1911, the Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who are residing or domiciled on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.431" offset="7680770">The facts are not disputed that the Indian children in this case never resided on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.752" offset="7706056">The Indian mother left the reservation and had these children in Harrison County Hospital, where they were taken subsequent to that by the adoptive parents and they were... entered their petition for adoption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.389" offset="7840639">Justice O'Connor, that was a legal abandonment, which has also been upheld In... in a recent case, an 1986 case, by the Alaskan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.697" offset="7885883">And our court found that there was a legal abandonment when the mother traveled to Harrison County and had these children and placed them with adoptive parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.803" offset="7918275">These adoptive parents did not go to the reservation and take... and remove these children from the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.207" offset="7939904">The mother went to great lengths to see that these children were born in Harrison County and that they were placed with adoptive parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.111" offset="7967490">This is reiterated by the reaffirmations of the consent which our state court noted and I think which you have copies of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.698" offset="7993821">Subsequent to the adoption petition being filed, they reaffirmed their consent... both parents... and also in this reaffirmation stated that they specifically wanted the Holyfields, who are the adoptive parents, to have these children and to adopt these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.393" offset="8060590">And they specifically wanted the state court or the lower state court in Harrison County, Mississippi, to handle this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.999" offset="8091101">Under Section 1911, which is the first section of the Act, it gives the tribal court exclusive jurisdiction over children who are domiciled or residing on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.723" offset="8137912">Number one, the children have never resided on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.506" offset="8149093">And our state court decided in their opinion the definition of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.460" offset="8164871">Now, I think it has been incorrectly stated that they completely reversed their position on the issue of domicile in the definition of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.047" offset="8195277">And I would like to speak to that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.083" offset="8203427">The cases being referred to are a Watson case, which was decided almost ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.403" offset="8228714">In that particular case, in the watson case, the children, minors, were removed from the county of their domicile by a grandparent after their parents were killed in an automobile accident in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.961" offset="8278869">They were removed and a guardianship was attempted to be open in the county in which the grandparent lived, and the court says you have to go back to where those children and the parents resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.668" offset="8325785">Those children resided in the county with their parents, their natural parents, up until the death of their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.406" offset="8348668">So, there is no conflict there with our state court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.060" offset="8363297">Now, the... the case which followed that was the case of Stubbs v. Stubbs, and in that case, our court set its definition of determining domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.416" offset="8400704">In... number one, they said that domicile... when we talk about domicile and residence, I think we enter into the area of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.420" offset="8432783">And the court stated that the intent was very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.407" offset="8448665">So, as their criteria in Stubbs, they said these are the things that we will use to establish domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.210" offset="8471862">Number one is the physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.662" offset="8481684">Number two is the intent, and number three, other facts and circumstances surrounding the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.566" offset="8509374">So, when it came to this case, they said that the domicile of the child was the domicile of the adoptive parents, that the mother went great lengths to bring these children to Harrison County and leave them with adoptive parents.</text>
