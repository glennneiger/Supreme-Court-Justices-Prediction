            <text syncTime="8.979" offset="122382">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.600" offset="140877">William James Caldwell, who is Brower was killed when a stolen car that he had been driving at high speeds at an effort to elude the police, crashed into a police roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.461" offset="200331">His heirs, the petitioners here brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the roadblock amounted to excessive force and that respondents had therefore made an unreasonable seizure of Brower.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.405" offset="252158">The allegations were that the roadblock had intentionally been set up just around the bend in the road at night with a police cruiser stationed with its high-beam headlights shinning in the eyes of the on-coming car, so that the crash would be inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.839" offset="325824">The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a Fourth Amendment claim on the ground that the roadblock was reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.612" offset="364903">The Court of Appeals affirmed but on a different theory concluding simply that no seizure had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.842" offset="393846">Because the police roadblock terminated Brower's movement through means intentionally applied, we conclude that a Fourth Amendment seizure did take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.524" offset="428537">We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for consideration of whether the District Court erred in concluding that the roadblock was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.161" offset="467094">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun joined.</text>
