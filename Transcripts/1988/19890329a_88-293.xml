            <text syncTime="21.513" offset="234259">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.298" offset="245440">This case, your Honors, involves a dispute over who has the rights, under the 1976 Copyright Act, to authorize reproductions of a statue entitled "Third World America".</text>
            <text syncTime="35.321" offset="289534">The Community for Creative Non-violence, which is a homeless activist organization located here in Washington, originally had Third World America produced in order to serve as a symbol of the cause that they espouse and to help raise national consciousness about the plight of the homeless here in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.783" offset="359333">Consistent with that purpose, we would like to be able to disseminate as widely as possible throughout the United States reproductions of Third World America in the form of Christmas cards, posters, and other media, and then to apply whatever revenues are generated by those reproductions to help fund the work that we do with the homeless.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="438014">Mr. Reid, however, says that we cannot do so without negotiating his permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.583" offset="458494">Mr. Reid claims that he and he alone has the right to authorize reproductions of Third World America and to profit... and to derive any of the profits that are associated with those reproductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.108" offset="512620">Now, there's no written agreement in this case between Reid and CCNV.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.312" offset="529443">We basically had a handshake agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.430" offset="541982">CCNV, which depends upon volunteers to perform all of its services, asked Mr. Reid to donate his services to sculpt figures in Third World America.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.321" offset="589524">Mr. Reid agreed to do so, saying that he too was concerned about the homeless.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.375" offset="609691">And believing that all parties here were pursuing a common objective, we then proceeded to pay Mr. Reid $15,000 to cover his expenses, such as the rent on his studio, the various utilities, bills, the cost of his assistants, and the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.385" offset="673743">After the project was completed, after we had paid Mr. Reid the $15,000, and after we had given him the experience that we had of years of dealing with the homeless and our creative direction in sculpting the statue, Mr. Reid told us for the first time that his concerns for the homeless did not extend so far as to relinquishing his claim to what he considers to be the very valuable reproduction rights in Third World America.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.452" offset="781995">Believing that this was inconsistent with the spirit of the arrangement that we had worked out with Mr. Reid to begin with, and believing that any revenues that should be derived from Third World America should go to the benefit of the homeless and not to the benefit of any single individual, we filed this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.372" offset="1305697">I think from various amici briefs that have been filed in this case it is clear that the issue to be decided here has ramifications well beyond our organization and extends generally throughout the entire copyright community.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.113" offset="1360659">After our two-day bench trial, the district court found that we had the right to artistic control of the production of Third World America.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.385" offset="1397753">In applying what has been referred to as the historic control standard that had originally been developed by the courts under the 1909 Copyright Act the district court held that there was a work-for-hire employment relationship between CCNV and Reid and, thus, Third World America is a work-for-hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.532" offset="1474344">Now, before the district court, the choice of the standard to be applied under the 1976 Act was essentially non-controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.370" offset="1501720">Both Mr. Reid and CCNV agreed that that was the standard by which one determines an employment relationship not only under the 1909 Act but under the 1976 Act which, of course, we were proceeding under.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.927" offset="1547905">The case was therefore tried on the basis that there really was no dispute between the parties as to the legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.914" offset="1575908">The district court, as I said, applying that standard held that this is a work-for-hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.199" offset="1593044">And no one disputes in this case... and, indeed, the D.C. Circuit did not dispute... that if one applies that historic control standard, that this is a work-for-hire employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.590" offset="1638602">Now, rather, the dispute that has come before this Court turns on whether that standard, the historic standard, is the correct standard under the 1976 Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.982" offset="1684160">We agree with the position of the Second, the Seventh and Fourth Circuits, as well as Professor Nimmer, that the historic standard is indeed the correct standard and the district court acted properly in applying it in this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.455" offset="1734001">Reid and his various amici, however, have suggested that Congress abandon the historic test of the 1976 Act and they have provided to this Court a variety of different possibilities of tests that the Court could adopt in place of the old historic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.203" offset="1812995">One interesting fact from our perspective is that neither Mr. Reid not, with one exception, any of his amici, actually urged that this Court adopt the standard on which they won before the D.C. Circuit, which was essentially an agency law standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.878" offset="1879764">Now, we believe that the reason that so much distance has been placed between the court of appeals agency law standard and the historic standard is that there really is not much difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.388" offset="1933786">Both turn on the right-to-control.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.274" offset="1949355">Now, while there may be some differences that are unexplained by the court of appeals below and by the Fifth Circuit which also adopted that test, again, they basically are going to be looking at the same totality of circumstances to determine whether the hiring party here has the right-to-control.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.637" offset="3598726">He certainly is, your Honor, and this court has on other occasions certainly looked to his treatise to help understand the copyright laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.677" offset="3634880">The basic concern in this case, as in any case with statutory interpretation, is, of course, starting with the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.902" offset="3687856">I think the position of Mr. Reid and the Copyright Office and the other amici in this case, is that Congress in fact changed the law in the 1976 Act because it adopted a definition of the term "work-for-hire" for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.980" offset="3760163">There was no such definition in the 1909 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.916" offset="3775836">The 1909 Act, however, said in the case of a work-for-hire, the employer is considered to be the copyright owner of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.604" offset="3806661">That was Section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.654" offset="3810840">In Section 201 of the 1976 Act Congress said in the case of a work made for hire, it is the employer or other person for whom the work has been prepared who is the copyright owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.049" offset="3872385">And I think it's that simple comparison of language that suggests what Congress was doing in the 1976 Act was adding an entirely different category, a new category, the definition of work made for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.339" offset="3917524">Not those that are prepared by employers... or, by employees acting within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.409" offset="3937900">But, rather, those that are being prepared for someone other than the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.646" offset="3958798">What they were referring to there was, of course, what eventually became subdivision 2 of Section 101 dealing with commission works.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.235" offset="3997146">The essence of the argument on the other side is that Congress, by dealing with this category of commissioned works in Section 101, had effectively abrogated the old historic right-to-control standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.245" offset="4049182">And we submit that that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.678" offset="4054928">There is a great deal of controversy over what kinds of works ought to be considered commissioned works and treated as works for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.851" offset="4083663">But throughout that controversy there was no suggestion... and there is no suggestion anywhere in either the Act itself, in the reports accompanying the Act, in the Congressional debates, the hearings, the Register of Copyright Office report... that suggests that the old historic standard is being abandoned and replaced by something called "formal salaried employee" simply because Congress was choosing to deal with commissioned works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.732" offset="4187108">Congress did make a change in the 1976 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.636" offset="4202782">It dealt with commissioned works and established law, or clarified the law, and changed the law in some respects, that had developed under the 1909 Act with respect to commissioned works.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.743" offset="8291154">One of the interesting points when we were discussing... Petitioner was bringing up the issue of this historic definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.416" offset="8321874">It was historic... it was in existence for nine years, from 1966 to 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.485" offset="8342145">Prior to 1966 independent contractors were never considered employees under the work-for-hire doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.074" offset="8368476">And if the Court looks at the legislative history of this case, which is very similar to the legislative history in Mills Music which you ruled on, it was the same legislative history, and it took place in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.130" offset="8416751">In 1965 independent contractors were not employees within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.935" offset="8443918">There were other problems with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.320" offset="8453531">And it was the law in 1965 which is what was enacted in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.371" offset="8473697">The legislative history for this law was very unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.824" offset="8487490">What happened was that we had a 1909 Act that was becoming rapidly obsolete because of the technological advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.746" offset="8515180">Many special interest groups were before the Congress and they could not pass legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.781" offset="8535346">There was a legislative gridlock, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.083" offset="8544542">So Congress, through its agent, the Copyright Office, went out on a different trail to break this impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.618" offset="8566693">What they did was they commissioned studies and reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.419" offset="8577874">And then they brought all the players together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.938" offset="8583934">The Copyright Office picked representatives who they felt represented the various interests, sat them down, and forced them to negotiate together until they came up with a consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.127" offset="8624685">And this consensus... and this type of process happened in cable, fair use, termination, manufacturing clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.297" offset="8653420">It is replete throughout the whole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.233" offset="8661152">And those compromises is what was enacted into law in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.970" offset="8684140">In 1965 the termination and the work-for-hire hearings all took place and ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.707" offset="8715069">And in 1976 when the law was enacted, it was almost identical language that came out of these negotiations and hearings in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.396" offset="8749760">That is the language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.098" offset="8756656">And the law at the time did not have independent contractors, employees for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.002" offset="8780271">That came afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.502" offset="8786226">That was not what was before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.804" offset="8795422">It was not the compromise, as part of the compromise which they adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.506" offset="8810259">And that is clear from the case law and from all the different participants at the hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.960" offset="8832097">And it didn't matter which side of the table they were on, be in industry or the artists, they all used the term "employee" as a formal salaried employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.929" offset="10611977">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.631" offset="10626710">In October 1985 when Mr. Snyder called Mr. Reid on the phone and proposed that he sculpt the three human figures for the statue Third World America, the two men had never met before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.272" offset="10673312">They'd never done any business before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.724" offset="10683134">And except for suing each other, they've done no business since the statue was created.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.160" offset="10704868">In short, their entire relationship was defined by the particular project that Mr. Reid agreed to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.549" offset="10734439">That kind of relationship is what I think most people mean by the word "commission".</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.119" offset="10756695">Indeed, Mr. Snyder used himself no fewer than eight times at trial to describe his relationship with Reid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.058" offset="10792431">That is the same word that Mr. Snyder's trial counsel used when he summed up the trial, and it's the precise finding made by the trail court when it explained that</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.814" offset="10827435">"Third World America was commissioned by CCNV and made on commission by the artist. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.516" offset="10850318">Now, as it happens, there was a provision in the work made for hire definition that speaks directly to commissioned works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.055" offset="10880411">And the Court has not heard very much about that provision this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.174" offset="10892950">That subsection, which is Subsection 2, states that specially ordered or commissioned works will be treated as works made for hire when they satisfy both of two conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.631" offset="10934746">That they fall within the nine enumerated categories, and that there is a writing executed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.368" offset="10961704">The position of the Register of Copyrights in this case is simple and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.272" offset="10981348">The word 2 should be taken at its word, should be given its plain and literal meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.859" offset="11011650">And when that meaning is honored, it's perfectly clear that Third World America is a commissioned work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.597" offset="11034638">The court need not struggle with the various historical definitions of the word "employee" because this is a case about the word "commission".</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3202.843" offset="12959549">Thank you, Mr. Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.210" offset="12965087">Mr. Garrett, you have four minutes remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.081" offset="12992568">Both Mr. Reid and the Government here refer to the historic standard as one that was adopted only nine years prior to the 1976 Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.003" offset="13024228">They're both wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.371" offset="13029662">If you take a look at the very first edition of Nimmer on Copyright in 1963, you will see that even there he talks about the right-to-control standard as being a standard well ingrained in the copyright laws, and cites cases going back a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.962" offset="13080026">We cited cases in our brief going back as far as 1937 dealing with right-to-control standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.600" offset="13102595">Furthermore, if you take a look at the letter that the Register of Copyright sent to Congress back in 1986, you'll see that he refers... and this is on page 2(a) of the Appendix of our Reply Brief... as this being a standard that has been part of our copyright laws for almost a hundred years.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3253.526" offset="13162364">That depends on what all those old cases were referring to when they said right-to-control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.847" offset="13187650">I mean, you can describe the master/servant rule as a right-to-control rule also.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.400" offset="13209802">That is correct, your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3267.352" offset="13217639">You have to assume that they're using right-to-control in the very narrow sense that you're using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.171" offset="13232894">Not right-to-control physical activities but just to control the product, the outcome.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Alan Garrett</label>
            <text syncTime="3275.273" offset="13249299">--I believe that the courts were using it, your Honor, in the various cases that we cite in our brief in the sense of right-to-control the artistic production of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.510" offset="13274272">Something that has meaning to what copyright law is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.612" offset="13286706">Not what chisel you use, but rather how you produce the particular statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.516" offset="13302275">The kinds of contributions that we, CCNV, made in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.135" offset="13316800">That is exactly what they were referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.003" offset="13324218">And there was no question in the district court's mind when it went to trial in this case that that was the kind of standard it was asked to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.507" offset="13354207">Indeed, that's the standard that Mr. Reid said we should look at, and that's the standard that he found was satisfied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.125" offset="13376672">And our view, your honors, is that there is going to be a new standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.461" offset="13386076">And we talk about all of the different standards in our briefs that Mr. Reid's amici have adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.815" offset="13411467">This morning I have heard yet additional criteria and additional factors that one should look at in order to determine whether an employment relationship should be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.068" offset="13440515">But the fact of the matter is that none of these tests... none of these tests... was before the district court when we went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.288" offset="13465384">We all went on the basis of the historic right-to-control test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.007" offset="13480222">And we believe that's the correct test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.376" offset="13485760">But, if this Court is going to adopt different test, as the court of appeals below did, then we ask that, at the very least, that this case be sent back to the district court so the district court can evaluate the relationship of the parties in light of whatever new-found standard is adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.654" offset="13558798">That is exactly the approach the court has taken in other cases that we cite in our brief, Kelly v. Southern Railway, for example, a case very much like this one where a different standard was adopted by the court of appeals to determine who was an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.997" offset="13612192">That was applied at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.949" offset="13624000">This Court held that the court of appeals was right with its standard, but sent it back so that the district court could evaluate the facts of the case under that standard.</text>
