            <label>Mr. Charles H. Livaudais</label>
            <text syncTime="55.107" offset="323793">Is that it?</text>
            <text syncTime="56.297" offset="328600">This is a case also involving obscenity, is involving the criminal prosecution of appellee Ledesma in this case both for the sale of obscene publications and the possession of obscene publications with the intent to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.681" offset="414072">The primary issue in this appeal raised on appeal is a procedural question in enforcing a state statute and the question as post to the Court is whether or not in a state criminal prosecution under a valid and constitutional state statute which has been filed constitutional by the three-judge court relative to sale and possession with intent to sale obscene materials and publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.900" offset="526921">It is necessary that there be a judicial adversary hearing prior to the arrest and prosecution of the defendant to determine in advance of his arrest or prosecution whether or not the materials and publications involved are obscene under the terms of the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.412" offset="604975">We will have other related issues which I will cover in connection with this in reference to the jurisdiction of this Court on appeal in light 28 U.S.C. 1253 in the Gunn case which has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.886" offset="650951">We also have problems connected involving injunctions and declaratory judgments under 2283 which has also been discussed and intervention by federal courts and state proceedings and abuse of discretion by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.644" offset="717928">This case originated on January 27th of 1969 when two deputies of the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office and the State of Louisiana purchased four obscene publications from Ledesma at his store in St. Bernard Parish in Arabi, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.933" offset="791071">These publications and the other publication I required to are here with the record which I brought in filing with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.754" offset="830360">Ledesma was arrested and at the time of his arrest, these deputies selected certain publications, the three-judge court found it to be the number 45 from his shelves as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.623" offset="877902">Four bills of information were filed against him by me in the state court, two of them under the state statute relative to sale and possession with intent to sell obscene publications, and two almost identical bills of information under the parish ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.717" offset="942268">These two charges under the parish ordinance which were almost identical to the state ordinance were subsequently now crossed or dropped by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.651" offset="978004">Now in this prosecution in the state court, Ledesma was afforded an adversary judicial hearing focusing on the obscenity of these publications in the form of a motion to suppress the evidence and a motion to quash the indictment which he filed under state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.862" offset="1046862">The basis, one allegation was that our statute was vague and overbroad and the other was that the materials were not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.836" offset="1078732">This was decided within two weeks after his arrest, he had his hearing in state court and we tried this issue and the state judge denied the motions of Ledesma.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.987" offset="1123349">Wanting another bite at the apple, he then went to Federal Court to ask the Federal Court for relief under the civil rights statute asking to declare both our state statute and our parish ordinance unconstitutional for vagueness and overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.903" offset="1178937">Also asking for injunctions against pending and state -- and future state prosecutions and also asking that we be enjoined from retaining the publication in our possession and using them at prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.773" offset="1234422">Also, he asked for damages in the sum of $30,000.00 each for his clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.424" offset="1257096">After a long and prolonged hearing in the court, not in court but the proceeding in the District Court after the three-judge court was convened on July 14th of 1969, some five to six months after the arrest, the three-judge court in a two-to-one decision with Judge Rubin dissenting held first all that our state statute, the two provisions, Subsections 2 and 3 involved herein were held to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.210" offset="1380185">Judge Rubin concurred in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.243" offset="1388335">The court in its order had stated and I say they alleged that they denied to grant the injunctive relief, grant, as a matter of fact they say we specifically deny injunctive relief.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="333.109" offset="1435773">Well, did they deny or did they grant injunctive relief in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="336.588" offset="1449775">Your Honor, I'll get to that but my opinion and I think this Court will see that we were enjoined both pending and future prosecutions were enjoined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.600" offset="1489795">That the court ordered its judgment in this way so as to get around the provisions or Article 2283 and this Court and other cases which I will give to the Court shortly look through this particular type of action by a court where it tried to evade 2283, and actually had an order which had practical effect, the operating effect of an injunction in the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.888" offset="1714970">Is that not, I don't know about Louisiana, but is that not a fairly familiar technique of District Court to say in effect that they will not enter a formal order of injunction on the assumption of the party will abide to suggestion that they are not going to proceed with the prohibited act which is real --</text>

            <text syncTime="430.972" offset="1827297">That is a common practice, Your Honor and one that I do not think as advisable for a District Court to take like that Article 65 Subsection C of the Federal Rule of the Civil Procedure is a mandate to Federal District Courts especially the three-judge court that when they are dealing in the area of injunctions as was stated in the footnotes to the Gunn case by this Court, that they should be specific, that it is in effect unfair for them to deal with areas such as this and not deal with them in a clear manner so that their intention is obvious to the parties, that was the problem in the Gunn case.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.506" offset="2009422">First of all, I'd like to point out that in this case as opposed to other cases I've been arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.629" offset="2025932">We did not agree to stop our prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.362" offset="2040769">The record shows that first of all, our case was set for trial in February of 1969, the record does not show that but a note of evidence is a result of a conference with Judge Boyle in this case shows that our case was first set, again set the trial on April 21st of 1969, that is in the record at page 1, page 97 I think, my co-counsel filed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.645" offset="2157902">Also, that was continued to that date to give this three-judge court time to issue its decision which it had not done as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.049" offset="2191548">It was continued to April 28 of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.897" offset="2210983">It was again continued by me after a phone call from the District Judge stating that the decision by this three-judge court would be rendered in the near future and that we would be able to take whatever action we had to after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.548" offset="2277543">So we did not abide by any request.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.148" offset="2291963">We did not concede to this Court that they, that we would have to hold our prosecution prior to their decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.606" offset="2477746">That was the wording of the judgment at page 97 in the appendix to this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.041" offset="2499584">The pending prosecution should be effectively terminated, now whether they say should be enjoined or effectively terminated, it has the same meaning as our contention that we were enjoined and that this order ordering us to give up or evidence to return it instanter and also to suppress it in any prosecutions that both pending and future is -- has all the practical and full force and operative effect of an injunction upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.339" offset="2616717">What better way to stop our prosecution than to take our evidence away from us or to tell us that we will -- we're not in good faith continued prosecutions or to say that the prosecution should be effectively terminated?</text>
            <text syncTime="641.291" offset="2668544">And Your Honor, there is a case that is not in my brief, I wish to cite it at the Court, at this, to the Court at this time in connection with the Gunn case which came out after my brief is at the premise International Longshoremen's Association versus Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, found at 389 U.S. 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.185" offset="2740120">In that case, there was an order, an arbitration -- an arbitration award and a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.552" offset="2785573">It was not before the Court but then after dispute arose over the arbitration order, the union went in the court and they asked the court to give an order and the court gave this order, I quote, “that the arbitration award be specifically enforced and then he went on out of the union to comply with and abide with the award.”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.507" offset="2857357">And on the appeal to this Court, even though the word injunction was not used, Your Honors held that and I quote, “whether or not the District Court's order was an injunction, it was an equitable decree, compelling obedience under the threat of contempt and was therefore an order granting an injunction.”</text>

            <text syncTime="936.045" offset="3847502">I think that would show and not just a prosecution but the retaining of the evidence and the orders of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.935" offset="3887104">Now, the sole reason again, looking at the decision of the court, the sole reason for the entire decision of this Court can be seen both in the judgment and the footnotes, appendix 96 and 97 was that this Court felt that there must be a prior judicial adversary hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.455" offset="3981145">That is a sole reason for doing what they did and they so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.328" offset="3996714">This is a concept that they derived from the Marcus case and A Quantity of Books case which cases which are referred to in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.077" offset="4031718">I wish to point out again to the Court this time that we did have in this case an adversary judicial determination of obscenity, obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.775" offset="4066513">There was a hearing in Court on the Ledesma's motion to quash and motion to suppress, wherein the District Court did view the books and made its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.409" offset="4109040">He did have an adversary judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.630" offset="4121893">The only thing new being requested is that this be a prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.069" offset="4143626">That this adversary hearing be held before any arrest or any prosecution of the defendant, and I submit to Your Honor that this Court Your Honors have never held that in a criminal prosecution that this is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.428" offset="4205066">As a matter of fact, you have indicated your preference for the conventional course of criminal procedure in enforcing this cases, not to say that other methods cannot be used but I think that in these decisions, Francis and the Kingsley Books case, they are where New York attempted to supplement its conventional coarse of criminal procedure in dealing with these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.128" offset="4299839">The problem with the Court at that time was that you were hesitant to allow them to supplement their procedures and throughout the cases, Roth case, Albert's case which I have quote in my brief there, Your Honors indicated that such a hearing was not necessary by its light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.622" offset="4377893">But in the New York Feed case and Milky Way cases which were to decided in February of 1970 by Your Honors, you summarily affirmed the decision of the three-judge court which held affirmatively that this adversary judicial determination of obscenity was indeed a novelty, was unnecessary, and afforded no special protection to the books taking time cognizance of the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Warren in the Roth case, that in these cases involving criminal prosecutions, it is the person who is on trial, not the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.872" offset="4542882">That decision was summarily affirmed by this Court and as seen in the record page 121 of the appendix, after Your Honors came out with your summary affirmation of the New York Feed and Milky Way cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.594" offset="4589798">I went back to our three-judge panel and I told them in my motion which is in the record here that the Supreme Court has finally decided this issue as to whether or not there must be a prior adversary hearing in criminal prosecutions and I filed the motion, we argued the case, submitted memorandums and the motion was denied and I submit that this number one is proof of the injunctive intent of the lower court and also, Your Honor I feel that in this case, we are asking you to take jurisdiction and to decide these issues because obviously from the action of the three-judge court in our case is summary affirmation by Your Honors, is not enough to straighten out them arrest that has resulted in three-judge district in this area, and we must have a pronouncement from this Court as to whether or not this type of hearing is necessary, and that is what we're asking you to do at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.607" offset="4837752">We also fear Your Honor that we do have a question argue in the other cases before us, Article 2283, the abstention doctrine in view of Dombrowski, Cameron and the Atlantic Coast cases and we just wish to point out strongly in line with that that there was no finding of bad faith on our part in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.108" offset="4927822">There was specific finding of good faith on our part and the Cameron case read together with Dombrowski, the Atlantic Coast cases are specific, that before this three-judge courts can interpose themselves in place of the United State Supreme Court in state prosecutions, that there must be bad faith prosecution, there must be a statute which is filed unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.860" offset="5038791">In our case, the court specifically found that the sections of our statute that we're dealing with are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.088" offset="5067734">Now, the Court also abused its discretion in ordering us to return these books and in not invoking the adoption of abstention, and I argued this in connection with the court's action in declaring our parish ordinance unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.298" offset="5148609">Our reference to our parish ordinance Your Honor, there was no case, there was no controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the action taken by the course -- by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.365" offset="5204825">And Golden v. Zwickler which was a clarification of Zwickler v. Koota, this Court held that although the court might have jurisdiction to hear declaratory judgments where there's allegations of a controversy in the absence of an actual controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality, the court should not make declaratory judgments in an advisory capacity only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.085" offset="5315688">The purpose of this being obviously to keep the three-judge courts from taking the prerogative of the United States Supreme Court to issue these doctrines especially in this case of obscenity which is so critical to our whole procedure in prosecuting these cases in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.804" offset="5402624">One obvious result that we can see from the three-judge court's stepping into these cases is the fact to state in the previous case, “I am curious yellow” involving that, that there are five other cases pending in federal district three-judge courts involving the same issues and its my intention that if these cases were allowed to go through the normal course of procedure as stated in the Atlantic Coast case, that we would not have a confusion that we have today in this field of obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.753" offset="5626337">This time I would like to sum up where I consider the major points in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.317" offset="5652668">One is the jurisdiction of question which I think that we have answered clearly as far as the injunctive intent of the three-judge District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.240" offset="5696345">Also, the fact that in cases involving criminal prosecutions that there are adversary judicial hearings, and that in light of this Court's summary affirmation of the Milky Way and New York Feed cases, that there is no need to have this hearing prior to the arrest of the defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.635" offset="5789863">At this, in effect we give no more protection to the publications than having the hearing after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.557" offset="5817553">At this extraordinary protection which is not allowed in Federal Law would serve to help the lawbreaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.932" offset="5847124">It would not have any further effect in securing First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.276" offset="5872515">We do feel that there has been a definite abuse of the Court's discretion under the provision and the mandates of Article 2283 and of the dictates of this Court and the Dombrowski case, the Cameron case and the Atlantic Coast case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.313" offset="5936671">In our case, where there has been no finding of bad faith of any kind by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.933" offset="5963107">Our state statute of Sections 2 and 3, which are the only ones before this Court today have been held constitutional and that there has been no appeal taken from this decision of the Court by appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.000" offset="6027368">We further feel that there has been an abuse under the declaratory judgment act and that the doctrine of abstention should have been invoked in this case in reference to the three-judge courts declaring our St. Bernard Parish police jury ordinance unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.520" offset="6093406">I based that on the finding not in Zwickler v. Koota which has been submitted to this Court and previous argument erroneously I think, but in the case of Golden v. Zwickler which enlarged this Court's viewpoints in Zwickler v. Koota and which this Court specifically held referring to Zwickler v. Koota from which it originated, that there must be a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.260" offset="6200404">There was no such issue before the three-judge court in our case and that there were no pending prosecutions under that ordinance and there were no, and in view of the fact that the prosecutions had been terminated, there were no threats of any future prosecutions under that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.295" offset="6272502">So here, we have a case of clear abuse by three-judge court under the provisions of 2283 by interfering with state court prosecutions and going even further than that and legislating criminal procedure for a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.887" offset="6330911">I think that in doing this, that this federal three-judge -- that this Court has abused its power and you serve the powers of this Court in deciding Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.079" offset="6379708">I'll save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.418" offset="6432998">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.183" offset="6448149">I think that there are basically three issues which this case present to this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.058" offset="6471555">First, there is the threshold question of whether or not this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal in view of the provisions on Section 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.380" offset="6512933">Once that hurdle is passed, I submit that the issues then are first, did the Court below abused its discretion in granting the relief it granted or does Section 2283, the federal anti-injunction statute prevent the court below from taking the action that it took?</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.519" offset="6585448">And then the third question, if this Court has jurisdiction and the court below properly considered the issues on the merits below, then did it properly decide the merits in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.774" offset="6642500">But before getting into those questions, I would like to emphasize certain facts in this case which I think are relevant and should be called in with the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.340" offset="6672697">When August Ledesma, the newsstand operator in this case decided to mark off a section of his new store Chalmette, Louisiana and sell within that section to adults only erotic literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.428" offset="6737063">He did sell with a full knowledge that the sheriff's department was aware of what he was doing and would be watching what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.665" offset="6774053">He was not secreting his publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.953" offset="6787218">He was not selling them even under the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.370" offset="6800802">So that the sheriff's department had adequate time to take any procedural measures that are constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.608" offset="6841762">They cannot argue that there was any impediment of time or fact which would have prevented them from giving Ledesma the full measure of his procedural constitutional protection to which he would be entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.590" offset="6893693">But in view of this fact on January 27, 1969, after watching his store for sometime, they went in, purchased a couple of magazines, briefly looked at them and then arrested him and seized 45 other of his publications on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.951" offset="6963179">They did not seek to obtain nor did they obtain an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.752" offset="6982405">They did not seek to obtain nor did they obtain a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.111" offset="6999855">They did not seek to have nor was held any kind of adversary hearing before a judge or magistrate which could have given them any kind of judicial opinion as to whether or not these publications were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.968" offset="7059205">Rather this way occurred, something because two members of the sheriff's department in this parish in Louisiana decided that in their family, publications were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.423" offset="7101106">Now there was only one prosecution in this case that's true but I think it should be pointed out further that the deputy sheriff made it clear that the rest of these magazines that were in that store had better be taken off the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.381" offset="7156903">The affidavit filed by Ledesma and by his attorney below indicated that one of the deputies told him on three separate occasions, you'd better get rid of the rest of these magazines, and of course there's no doubt what he was talking about, there would have been further prosecutions if he had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.552" offset="7229628">Now, in view of that fact, the three-judge court below rendered certain relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.738" offset="7254288">First, it declared that this part of the state statute and the parish ordinance were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.472" offset="7289292">Now, this case below was combined with another case called Delta Book Distributors versus Cronvich, and in the other case with which this case was combined below, the defendant and the criminal defendants had been charged under Section 7 of the State Obscenity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.217" offset="7356270">So that in this decision in this case, the court below held that Section 7 of the State Obscenity Act was unconstitutional on its face for overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.956" offset="7411231">And in view of the statements by this Court in Zwickler versus Koota, we feel that this should be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.121" offset="7439862">Further, the Court below declared that procedure of arresting and seizing these publications without an adversary hearing was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.281" offset="7480508">And then the court ordered a return of the seized magazines and their suppression in evidence in the state of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.829" offset="7514676">And the court below did not enjoin the state criminal prosecution and specifically declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.518" offset="7545396">He did not enjoin further arrest in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.708" offset="7570160">It did not enjoin the state prosecution facing Ledesma resulting from these seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.799" offset="7606523">It simply exercised its authority as a court protecting federal rights by determining what would happen to these magazines and specifically it said, give the magazines back because you seized them in violation of constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.222" offset="10244263">Yesterday afternoon, I located a comment in the April 1970 Edition of the Harvard Law Review which may be appropriate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.251" offset="10276342">And an article entitled Section 1983 Jurisdiction, the commentator pointed out that an examination of 100 private civil rights cases reported in the federal supplement from December 1966 to March 1968, shows that 67 were dismissed without a trial or hearing, the vast majority on the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.566" offset="10369651">“The statistics suggest” said the writer, “that most Section 1983 cases even now are quickly disposed off and pose little time problem for federal courts”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.461" offset="10417194">And the remaining 35 cases, plaintiffs obtain preliminary relief and 12 without an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.983" offset="10443316">Only seven cases appeared to have been tried and five of those resulted in a judgment of the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.717" offset="10466200">That might also suggestive that it requires a bit of wasted time of members of federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.803" offset="10498591">It's a problem that perhaps is easy and certified by Second Circuit by the First Circuit, but in the larger geographical circuits, the very assembling of one circuit judge, which is required by the statute, two district judges and if they're traveling to wherever the court is going to be held is a great, can add up to a great deal of expenditure of judicial time, and if as it turns out, most of this cases end up by getting dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.559" offset="10613635">It suggests it's a bit of waste of time, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.745" offset="10642369">However, if complaint is considered frivolous, the District Court is under no obligation to request a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.584" offset="10673716">And I submit that this situation is roughly analogous to the removal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.746" offset="10698376">Now, there for a while, we have a flurry of removal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.187" offset="10712168">But once they've seen that the federal courts simply are not going to inappropriately intervene, unless there is really a chilling effect by the prosecution in the state criminal case, then counsel will surely learn not to waste their time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.123" offset="10771832">But we submit that the decision initially as to whether or not to implement the provisions of the injunctive authority should be with the rest with the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.908" offset="10818957">Federal state relations were not to see manage for the future and we don't know that there might be sometime in the future in which federal courts will find it very necessary to intervene in these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.225" offset="10880293">We submit that the discretion of the lower court should be respected and perhaps to call on a phrase, the Court should exercise appellate judicial restraint in that regard and permit the different courts to make that initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.409" offset="10944972">Incidentally, the Sixth Circuit on September the 9th in the case of Honey versus Goodman held that the anti-injunction statute did not bar 1983 proceeding, even after the proceedings were instituted in state court, so that at least in the view of that Court, the Atlantic Coast Line decision from this Court does not mean that you can't proceed with the 1983 action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.586" offset="11185716">The original anti-injunction statute I believe was 1793, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.875" offset="11202853">It's a very early statute, very early statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.612" offset="11225840">So that the reconstruction of Congress has that in mind and nonetheless passed 1983 providing for suits and equity in these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.516" offset="11261471">Now, to come to the merits of the case, counsel for the appellant has argued specifically on the question of whether an adversary hearing is required before an arrest can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.058" offset="11315597">We call the Court's attention to that fact that in this case, there was no judicial supervision whatsoever, there's no application for an arrest warrant or search warrant either and none was obtained in spite of the fact that they had all the time they needed in order to attempt to obtain such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.129" offset="11379858">But we would go further than that and argue that the court below was correct in its determination that there should be if time and circumstances permit in the specific fact situation involved, then there should be a prior adversary judicial hearing on the question of the obscenity of the publications before the publications can be disturbed by the prosecuting officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.745" offset="11482363">Now, we say that because that is the method by which the publications can be given a maximum procedural protection to which we feel that presumptively protected first amendment materials are entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.875" offset="11558849">Simultaneous things from this Court have indicated that there maybe materials that are hardcore and that this can be recognized easily but speaking from the standpoint of someone like Ledesma, I can assure the Court that it is extremely difficult to distinguish between those publications which will get you in danger of prosecution and of conviction and those publications which are safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.354" offset="11656756">It is impossible to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.755" offset="11666369">And our neighboring State of Mississippi, we recently had one Federal District Court to hold that the movie “The Fox” was not obscene as a matter of law and the neighboring District Judge in Mississippi held that it was hard core pornography, the very same film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.889" offset="11730944">Now, there are simply differences in this area of obscenity because of the subject, the values involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.852" offset="11762813">And the opinions of the Deputy Sheriff from St. Bernard's Parish can be so different from those of newsstand operator, an attorney or a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.758" offset="11806386">We feel that the only safe approach to take as long as the Court does feel that there is not an absolute right to possess and disseminate erotic materials under controlled circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.844" offset="11858735">As long as this Court takes the position that the State can suppress the very controlled dissemination of these materials then surely there must be a procedure by which the newsstand operator can know what's safe for him to sell and what is not safe for him to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.114" offset="11923832">We submit that experiences shown that in circumstances of obscenity, the only fair way in a situation in which an adversary hearing can be held is to grant the newsstand operator an adversary hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.486" offset="12041279">That case was decided by this Court, the jurisdiction was declined on the same day that Your Honors referred our case to an argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.141" offset="12083911">I'm sure you saw the distinction in that case as I see between that case and our case and that is on the Dial case, the Court recognized that this case involves only one contested issue of law, that is whether or not the Constitution of the United States requires an adversary hearing to determine the question of obscenity, must be held prior to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.632" offset="12173876">Now, that was submitted by stipulation of the parties to the court, strictly for the Court to decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.278" offset="12204492">There was no pending prosecution, there was not even a threat of future prosecution but this Dial case amounts to is a submission by both sides for declaratory judgment in that case and I appeal that that must be what this Court recognize when it declines jurisdiction in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.174" offset="12276067">There was no pending prosecution, no treats, no issue other than the one issue as to whether or not a prior adversary hearing is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.757" offset="12318386">That was the sole issue in the Dial case and what I have just quoted to you is from the report and 303 Federal Supplement 436 at page 438.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.464" offset="12373243">So there is an easy distinction between the Dial case and our case, well, this was a contested case whether questions of constitutionality of our statute, there were questions of bad faith and unfortunately the statute and this is an easy distinction to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.719" offset="12478255">There have been some comments made by counsel concerning not either using the word “threats” I don't think but something akin to that by the police officers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.534" offset="12525484">I'd like to point out to this Court that in the finding of the District Court after a hearing on this case, they wanted to hear an affidavit so we heard it on affidavit but we did submit affidavits, they found no bad faith, they found no threats, they found no bad faith at all in our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.008" offset="12595388">Their decision was made strictly on this question of the adversary hearing which is an erroneous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.829" offset="12622660">This case -- this issue has been settled by this Court and the New York Feed and Milky Way cases which asked the specific question and this Court affirmed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.728" offset="12666232">This time we're asking the Court to reaffirm that decision, your decision in the Milky Way and New York cases using your own words that once and for all, these three-judge courts will understand what Your Honors are telling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.665" offset="12718059">This is the problem that happens when we have so many federal three-judge courts interfering with state prosecutions, each one of them giving their own pronouncement and they are so different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.892" offset="12762990">It has caused great confusion in the law and a lot of confusion as to field of obscenity has been caused not by Your Honors in the United States Supreme Court but by the three-judge courts that have so many varying opinions as to what should be the law of the land in its area.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3181.479" offset="12829236">Now, you are now addressing yourself not to the propriety of any action of a three-judge court in cases generally but you're talking about the necessary antecedent conditions to an obscenity prosecution, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.077" offset="12895692">I say that in this case, in this particular instance concerning prior adversary hearing, Your Honors have spoken out on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.141" offset="12935920">What I'm saying is that this is the evidence of the entire overall problem of the three-judge courts making pronouncements that really should be made by this Court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Livaudais</label>
            <text syncTime="3221.243" offset="12988374">Yes, have been made, have been made but unfortunately, in that case was a summary affirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.214" offset="13012198">I think that's the reason why I couldn't sell our court on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.891" offset="13026931">They want to hear it from your own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.510" offset="13033409">They don't just want a summary affirmation to a lower three-judge courts decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.860" offset="13058800">Now, I think that if we will -- I think that if the lower courts would follow more the mandates of 2283 and let the conventional course of procedure go through, you wouldn't have a lot of the problems you've had in our case and to the other cases that I've heard today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.169" offset="13120031">One problem you've had and all of these cases have been a lack of a record, a lack of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.357" offset="13144795">You can't really tell what a case is about unless you had a trial on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.926" offset="13163081">In our case, we do have a number of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.833" offset="13174680">For instance we have affidavits in the record of our sheriff stating that he received complaints from clergy and people in the neighborhood and schools and churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.496" offset="13213341">We have affidavits in our record that showed that we had minors in this very store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.128" offset="13227865">We have affidavits of minors in this record stating that they went into the store and got publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.461" offset="13261197">This is evident of the fact that these books do get to the children no matter what types of safeguards are attempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.768" offset="13298395">In view of this Your Honor, we ask that you accept the jurisdiction and that you issue your own pronouncement as to this prior adversary hearing and reaffirm your decision of the New York Feed and the Milky way decisions and reaffirm your pronouncement of the Atlantic Coast case in reference to 28-2283 to stop this constant interference by federal district courts and state court actions.</text>
