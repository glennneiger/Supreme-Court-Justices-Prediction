            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments next in Number 133, United States against the Luros, Claimant and Thirty-Seven (37) Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.113" offset="307806">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="57.834" stopTime="1043.012">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="57.834" offset="334660">May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.790" offset="350542">This case comes here on an appeal from the three-judge district court in the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.585" offset="393697">The case is a customs seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.529" offset="413445">The claimant returned to this country by air on October 24, 1969 arriving in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.208" offset="456182">During customs inspection, the Thirty-Seven Photographs involved here were seized together with certain other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.549" offset="501530">All but the photographs have been returned and only the seizure of the photographs is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.579" offset="545729">It is stipulated and that the photographs were intended to be incorporated into a hard covered book and I quote from page 16 of the record in the stipulation, which book describes candidly a large number of sexual positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.448" offset="641128">On October 31, I may say the photographs have been lodged with the cleric of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.371" offset="668818">On October 31, 1969, the District Director of Customs advised the claimant Luros that the matter had been referred to the United States Attorney for forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.653" offset="734020">On November 4, the claimant’s attorney demanded the return of the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.910" offset="758993">On November 6, 13 days after the arrival in Los Angeles, the United States started this action for forfeiture, under title 19 of the United States Code, Section 1305(a), a statutory provision which is printed at pages 2-4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.667" offset="862020">Eight days later, the claimant filed an answer and counter claim contending that the photographs were not obscene and that the statutory provision was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.928" offset="923042">He moved for a three-judge court because he sought a declaration and injunction against the enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.470" offset="961285">And in order to convene, a three-judge court was entered on November 20, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.822" offset="994617">The hearing was held on January 9, 1970 and the three-judge court’s opinion was issued on January 27, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.415" offset="1056998">The court treated the motion for injunction as a motion to dismiss and assumed that the pictures are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.136" offset="1099943">That issue has never been adjudicated and is not directly involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.684" offset="1134111">What the court did was to rule that the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.147" offset="1171937">It reached this conclusion by an application or perhaps one can fairly say by an extension of this court’s decision in Stanley against Georgia, in 394 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.446" offset="1237138">Although, the claimant had stipulated that he imported the pictures for commercial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.052" offset="1263574">The court held that he had standing to attack the statute on the basis of its application to importation for private use, to which it said the Stanley case applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.697" offset="1330134">The court also held the statute unconstitutional under Freedman against Maryland in 380 U.S. Because it failed to guarantee that any restraint on allegedly obscene material would be imposed for only a specified brief period prior to judicial resolution of the issue of “obscenity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.090" offset="1451760">The first question, I wish to present is that with respect to Stanley against Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.485" offset="1489272">That case was won as the court observed in the opinion of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.815" offset="1522604">The court wrote a careful opinion which was narrowly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.621" offset="1553847">But in less than two years, it has proliferated in the lower courts, afar beyond anything that was presaged in this court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.332" offset="1608704">From protection to a man in his home, it has blossomed out to cover the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.963" offset="1647261">That extension is involved in this case in the Reidel Case which is the next on the calendar, and in several other cases which we have felt it necessary to bring to the court and in many others which are pending in lower courts awaiting this court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.138" offset="1739943">It’s also involved in the case of Burn against Carolexis (ph) at number 83 which was argued last term and re-argued on November 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.576" offset="1805667">Stanley against Georgia is obviously an important case, one that will be discussed for many years to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.587" offset="1849762">It has roots in the Boyd case of 8 years ago and Justice Brandeis's dissent in the Olmstead case, in Justice Harlan’s dissent Peo against Ullman, in Justice Stewart’s memorandum in Mapp against Ohio and in this court’s decision in Griswold against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.607" offset="1961775">It is not the worst for the fact that its conclusion has never been firmly bound to the text of any particular constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.456" offset="2009213">That fact may indicate however that those sound in result, the verbalization may be subject to further refinement as applied to particular new situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.473" offset="2077236">In the Stanley opinion itself, the court seemed to cover a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.404" offset="2112972">It distinguished in earlier cases on the ground that they and I quote, “Deal for the most part with the use of the mails to distribute objectionable material or was some sort of public distribution or dissemination,”.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.488" offset="2189354">That appears in page 561 of 394 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.104" offset="2211819">It referred to other cases as dealing and I quote, “With the power of the state and federal governments to prohibit or regulate certain public actions taken or intended to be taken with respect to obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.243" offset="2284335">Citing prosecutions for sale and distribution,” that likewise is on page 561.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.799" offset="2318608">It referred to this court’s decision in the Roth case as involving and I quote, “The regulation of commercial distribution of obscene material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.764" offset="2370435">That’s on pages 563 and 564.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.901" offset="2391019">And finally the court specifically stated that and again I quote, “Roth and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today’s holding,”.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.561" offset="2461654">This seems clear enough and it seems clearly applicable to the present case which after all involves importation and area traditionally subject to close control by Congress and importation for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.548" offset="2549530">The difficulty arises because of some passages in the opinion which I think must be regarded as passing references and not central to the decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.523" offset="2613478">The court did say that and I quote, “It is now well established that the constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="641.005" offset="2667395">And a little later on in the same paragraph, the court said that and I quote, “This right to receive information and ideas regardless of their social worth is fundamental to our free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.769" offset="2738448">That is fairly strong language but even that refers to the recipient and does not assert any such right to distribute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="671.446" offset="2789125">A little later, the court referred to “the transmission of ideas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="680.894" offset="2826951">But the essence of this court’s decision, we submit is found in it’s concern for Mr. Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.534" offset="2869478">It referred to a man sitting alone in his own home and in his own house.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.071" offset="2903646">It referred to his right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.262" offset="2948472">The majority of the court used some First Amendment language.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.729" offset="2974281">Other members of the court preferred to express the conclusion in Fourth Amendment terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.556" offset="3005628">Perhaps it could fairly be said here that the Fourteenth Amendment would suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.782" offset="3034467">But it was Mr. Stanley who was protected in the privacy of his own home, it was not the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.050" offset="3075532">They are still expressly subject to Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.307" offset="3096639">Indeed it was only last Thursday in the mailbox’s case that the court reiterated its previous determination that constitutionally protected expression is separated, and that is the word use by the court in quoting from one of its earlier opinions is separated from obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.958" offset="3199248">Mr. Stanley was found to be protected within wide limits, within the privacy of his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.832" offset="3230699">Even on that however, there are I think some limits and this maybe shown by a case which crossed my desk last week and is before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.962" offset="3287228">This is Reidel against the United States No. 6266, this term where a man was legally arrested in his own apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.373" offset="3332890">If you remember in Stanley, there was a valid search warrant to search the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.983" offset="3355355">At the time of his arrest, a sort of shotgun was in plain view and this was seized by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.739" offset="3394330">His conviction for possession of an unregistered sort of shotgun was affirmed by the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.570" offset="3433618">Apparently, it is not the privacy alone which is the test, but privacy in association with ideas regardless of the character of the ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.911" offset="3490983">The significant point, I think, is that it is not the material which is protected by Stanley, just as sort of shutdown was not protected in the Biddle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.522" offset="3545422">It is the man in his house, it was not the obscene film which was the object of this court’s concern, it was the knock on the door, the intrusion on privacy under a warrant which did not in anyway referred to the material actually seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.832" offset="3638732">This was indeed very closely parallel to situation in Mapp against Ohio where a similar results were reached quashing of the conviction though by a some what different root.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.794" offset="3710516">As one author has said, quoted on page 13 of our brief, “The privilege recognized in Stanley is in short, a shield for the private citizen not a sword for the prevail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="922.911" offset="3795048">There is, we submit no right to be let alone in a custom search at the nation’s borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.070" offset="3831620">At that point, a man is not in the privacy of his own home or sitting in his own house to use the phrases used by the court in the Stanley opinion, Mr. Stanley was accused of a crime, here, no crime is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.356" offset="3928795">The procedures in rem against the merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.741" offset="3954291">Congress is exercising its undoubted power to exclude what it deems not just to the nation as a whole and which in itself can claim no First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.039" offset="4023568">Once beyond the custom’s barrier, materials cannot be retrieved no matter how they are used. The importation here was for a commercial purpose but this court’s decision should not turn on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.464" offset="4101204">What is important here was that there is no invasion of privacy, no entry into a man’s home in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.418" offset="4169017">I now turn to the second question covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.169" offset="4192005">The court below did not hold that the statute was unconstitutional with respect to commercial importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.944" offset="4231189">Instead, it held that it would be unconstitutional if applied to an importation for private use relying on Stanley.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1043.012" offset="4275388">Solicitor general, before you leave the Stanley, have all the Lower Court, have they been uniformed in giving what you call this standard due Stanley?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="1052.984" stopTime="1212.986">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1052.984" offset="4315303">All but one I believe Mr. Justice, it's very widespread, it’s recited at length in the appendices to the brief of the respondent in this case, I believe there is one case which has narrowed the extension of Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.795" offset="4402552">It has been from our point of view a very insidious disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.346" offset="4432750">The court below held that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statute in this case, to an importation for private use relying on Stanley and then held that the claimant here could attack the statute on that ground even though his importation was avowedly a commercial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.816" offset="4526686">As I’ve indicated, we think the court was wrong in its decision as to importation for private use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.422" offset="4561063">I don’t think that there is legitimately a difference between importations for commercial or for private use or that the Stanley case so requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.421" offset="4601083">But that question is involved in the United against 1200 foot reels of film, no. 364 of this term and in the United States against various articles of obscene merchandise, number 706 this term which are now pending on jurisdictional statement but there is no justification we submit for denying the application of the statute to an avowed commercial and imported merely because there may be a question in another application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.246" offset="4764400">The statute itself has a clear and broad Separability Clause applicable not only to provisions of the statute but to application to persons and places and this should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.054" offset="4831587">It would be improper to strike down the entire statute, we submit as the court below did at the behest of one to whom it validly applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.291" offset="4900551">And finally, I come to the question arising under Freedman against Maryland and under the recent application of that decision in the mailbox case of last week.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.548" offset="4981530">Your statement goes there’s no difference in an importation case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.623" offset="5557896">With respect to importation for private purposes, there maybe even more than two, I’ve been trying to hold these off but when Lower Courts won’t grant injunctions and won’t grant stays, and the consequence and in rem matter is, that it is imported and you lose jurisdiction, I have found it necessary to file a number of jurisdictional statements which I hope can simply be held in advance until the issue is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.274" offset="5684433">With respect to the Freedman problem, the procedural system involved in this case affords we submit, the protection with freedman and its progeny require.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.313" offset="5808671">The periods of time involved are the shortest which are compatible with sound resolution of the question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.340" offset="5840750">That is shown by the situation in this case where the importation was on October 24, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.492" offset="5877321">One week later, the matter was referred to the United States Attorney for forfeiture action and to get this government to move within one week is a remarkable achievement and the claimant was so advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.700" offset="5930193">On November 6 or 13 days after the importation, the United States commenced the present action in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.043" offset="5971571">Any further delays had been required by judicial proceedings and had been affected by the fact that the claimants sought a hearing by a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.394" offset="6016920">If the claimant had been willing simply to go to trial on the issue of obscenity, as a case cited in a footnote, and our brief shows, the whole matter could’ve been disposed off within two to three months at the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.956" offset="6075225">Although fixed time limits are not prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.250" offset="6096332">Statutory provisions do require custom’s agents to report their actions on these matters “immediately,” to the collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.533" offset="6149517">And when the matter is referred to the United States Attorney, another statutory provision directs him to start and prosecute the proceedings “forthwith without delay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.936" offset="6207091">The latter provision is Section 1604 in Title 19 of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.417" offset="6233004">The only gap in this procedure is with respect to the collector’s transmission of the case to the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.379" offset="6268844">This is however covered by a Bureau of Customs’ circular cited in the footnote to page 26 of our brief, which was developed by the customs’ bureau and the Department of Justice for the purpose of eliminating delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.001" offset="6351391">Now, that circular provision, it seems to me is worth looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.430" offset="6365080">It’s the footnote on page 26, it provides that the first examination shall be made “as soon as possible,” after it’s available for customs’ examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.673" offset="6414085">If the first examining officer concludes that it is something that should be looked into, it shall be reviewed by the District Director or his delegate “no later than the following business day.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.914" offset="6471032">If at any review the material is determined not to be obscene, it shall be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.504" offset="6497364">If at any review the material is determined to be obscene, and assent to forfeiture shall be solicited “forthwith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.999" offset="6539368">If dissent is not forthcoming “within one week,” or if assent is declined, the material shall be referred to the United States Attorney immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.059" offset="6591613">And if it is felt that the material is probably obscene but there is no clear precedent for the determination, the material shall immediately be forward for review by the bureau, by the most expeditious means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.537" offset="6657546">This procedure worked well in this case both administratively and judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.001" offset="6679385">Moreover, the materials here have a sort of timeless quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.994" offset="6699342">They are not like news or even like a current motion picture film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.485" offset="6725360">I have no doubt that they have commercial value if they can be use commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.006" offset="6747408">And I do not think that value can be said to be lessened by the lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.344" offset="6772799">There will no doubt always be audiences for such items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.153" offset="6795995">As they were in Greece and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.005" offset="6811355">I do not say this to excuse delay because I do not think there was in fact inappropriate delay on this case or any delay that is held invalid by the Freedman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.723" offset="6866213">It is simply that I think that the time pressures on these facts may well be less than they would be in some other case not now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.814" offset="6918666">The period here was we submit completely consistent with prompt yet responsible administrative and judicial proceedings on the issue of the obscenity of the material seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.111" offset="6979793">And for these reasons, because Stanley against Georgia does not apply to this case where no privacy of the home is involved, because the importation here was commercial and the claimant should not be allowed to assert any defect in the statute, if there is one in its application to importation for private use, and because the requirements of Freedman against Maryland were met here, the judgment below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.833" offset="7482702">This case arose when Mr. Luros was returning from Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.422" offset="7509034">He had in his luggage the 37 photographs involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.431" offset="7537142">He also had the two odd books, one, a Rollingsons and one of Peter Fendi and he also had a girlie magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.155" offset="7576012">The customs’ inspector made his snap judgment and found all of these items to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.141" offset="7615927">After we intervened in the case as the government did as the Solicitor General says, did return everything except the 37 photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.288" offset="7672560">It was stipulated that the photographs were intended to be used in the Kama Sutra; a book which the customs used to think was obscene but no longer believes to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.748" offset="7738389">We call to the attention of customs at the time by letter that the use of the book would be private in the sense that it was to be distributed only to consenting adults under such circumstances that it would not offend the general public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.343" offset="8824769">The government’s argument really comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.223" offset="8844309">The government states that, “Roth held in the first instance that obscenity was outside of the protection of the First Amendment and then as if nothing else has happened since Roth, as if there hadn’t been really dozens and dozens of cases with refinements and nuances and cutbacks, as if nothing had happened since Roth, they mechanically argued that obscenity is outside the protection of the First Amendment and can be handled exactly as any other merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.116" offset="8971786">That is the burden of the government’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.347" offset="8992789">The Solicitor General here interestingly calls to our attention the Biddle case which seems to me to show what is obvious that a book or other matter of communication cannot be treated and never has been treated by this court, the same as shotguns or gambling devices or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.385" offset="9120893">I’d like to spend, if I may a moment in terms of Roth and what has happened since Roth because I think that we cannot fairly evaluate Stanley without such a background and I agree completely with the Solicitor General that Stanley is a very important case and a case which will be looked at for many years to come.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.996" offset="9511372">It was, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.935" offset="9519104">But I would submit in all deference Mr. Justice Marshall that just as a bachelor can get some information and can satisfy some of his emotional needs by viewing such a film, a married person may also get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.080" offset="9587649">I suspect that Stanley is not limited to bachelor’s reading or viewing of such material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.990" offset="9615339">The government in Burn initially stated that it was not only in the privacy of one’s home but also in an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.689" offset="9650134">That’s what Burn says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.754" offset="9654418">When the government wrote Burn, they said it was the privacy of a home and office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.117" offset="9671868">Well, I would suspect that a person could take a book and go to the park and get whatever information or emotional satisfaction there just as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.317" offset="9720665">The crucial point as I read and read Stanley is that government does have legitimate interests and those will be protected completely but that those legitimate interests are narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.755" offset="9774373">One of the legitimate interest is not ever to tell adults what they should read or what they should see and it doesn’t matter whether they see it in a private boot walk, they see it in a friend’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.085" offset="9827662">If they see it in their office, the important thing is, that it’s not thrust upon an un-willing audience and that we have adequate of protection to see that the material is not distributed to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.697" offset="9886177">And those are we submit, the synthesis of all that has happened since Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.846" offset="9910732">Now at the time of Roth, the court was faced really with choices as the court has always faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.370" offset="9936854">There were three arguments that were being put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.558" offset="9961618">I was here then and I was making an absolutist argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.262" offset="9980426">I was saying that obscenity was absolutely protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.720" offset="9994219">There was, and before the house, the whole (Inaudible) arguments that obscenity had a very broad reach in terms of minors or portions of a book condemned the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.492" offset="10049390">And what the court did, it seems to me was to strike a balance and I must say in retrospect, the balance was one that although I didn’t agree with it then as I look back has a logic to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.335" offset="10108740">The balance that was struck was to try and get at the legitimate interests of society in this whole area and there was an enormous amount of protection given to such material in the Roth case even as the court said that “obscenity” was outside of the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.771" offset="10206438">And almost everything that this court has done since Roth with a few unhappy exceptions but almost everything that has been done since then has been to, first of all narrow the reach of the obscenity laws and secondly to expand and of course the other side of the same coin to expand the First Amendment protection afforded to sex material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.249" offset="10312391">The cases came down procedurally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.677" offset="10322108">Searches and seizures were narrowly cutback so that a lot of material would not be suppressed under Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.309" offset="10356590">The (Inaudible) requirement was found necessary in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.738" offset="10378324">In case after case, this court has said that this person or that person, this organization or that organization, it was not a Fifth party to determine what is and what is not obscene until finally in Rowen, the court came down and really sad, yes we’re entitled to have censorship and the censorship by 200 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.661" offset="10458049">Each person is his own censor and responsible to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.155" offset="10476022">And we don’t need postal inspectors or customs inspectors or district attorneys or police officers to make this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.623" offset="10513847">The truth of the matter is that this court has said even that or suggested, I know that Mr. Justice Brennan suggested and the earliest case, the Kingsley Boot case that a judge without a jury wasn’t qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.423" offset="10585109">There was a thought that we need juries and yet we see within many jury cases coming up that the juries also are not able to make the sensitive judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.035" offset="10623561">So jury verdicts have been overturned by this court which was necessarily then forced to act as a super censor to everybody’s discomfort and so this court has been attempting I submit, and properly to extricate itself from having to sit as a Board of super censors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.768" offset="10706422">And what has come down out of all this, it seems to me is to get away from this business of reading a book and looking in a movie and said yes, this is good or this is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.259" offset="10748426">It’s futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.415" offset="10756995">I think in that sense, that the Stanley opinion really synthesizes all of the legitimate interest and says a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.604" offset="10793775">First of all, it says that government simply has no business telling people what to read or view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.693" offset="10822196">All of the traditional arguments are no good; protect his morality, that’s his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.883" offset="10842885">The government shouldn’t be protecting the morality of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.954" offset="10859186">Anti-social conduct, no proof of that at all and besides, when the conduct appears, it’s time enough to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.024" offset="10895444">In short, the court seemed to have said, now let’s get to it and what is it that we’re concerned with?</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.331" offset="10924701">We’re concerned with minors, we have said so in the Ginsburg against New York file, minors can be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.910" offset="10951032">We’re concerned with trusting it upon unwilling audiences because the truth of the matter is that for many people to have a strong, explicit, sexual material thrust upon them, is very offensive not too unlike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.122" offset="11003904">perhaps the analogy in Chiplinsky which is thrusting and has some kind of a physical, emotional reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.689" offset="11042147">But beyond that, to say that government has the right to tell adults that they ought to read this because they may become aroused sexually or because they may have some fantasies, we know now, that that was a futile task which really bred a great deal of lawlessness below because the standards were always impossibly vague and there wasn’t always an enormous of hypocrisy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.981" offset="11163251">And so it was that after some 14 years of dealing with Roth and with a number of suggestions as to where we were going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.515" offset="11201390">Mr. Justice Brennan in Jacobella (ph) suggested back in 1964 that perhaps it would be wise or in better, if the states were to pinpoint their legislation at minors which then seemed to be the major concern of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.490" offset="11265337">Then in the Ginsburg case, Ralph Ginsburg, another legitimate state interest, governmental emerged and that was the business of thrusting it upon an unwilling audience and then finally in the Sam-Ginsburg case, this court said that minors could have a different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.420" offset="11345063">So that this Court before Stanley had carved down, it seems to me and had suggested that most of it in Redrup had carved out legitimate state interest and had said that here the government has a legitimate concern and the other side of the coin, we submit is that beyond that, there is no legitimate concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.879" offset="11430849">And that I believe is where Rowen also seems to have a relevance to this because Rowen, it's not mentioned by the government at all here but Rowen also has the two sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.393" offset="11500962">Rowen says that if a person doesn’t want something to cross the threshold of his home by mail, he can say no to that and he has the broadest power in saying no.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.164" offset="11728018">But of course, it’s true that Section 4009 was then enacted by Congress and this court merely said that that was a permissible exercise of the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.657" offset="11782040">Now, it’s within this framework, as I say that we come to Stanley, the Solicitor General says, he doesn’t know what provision of the First Amendment is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.052" offset="11831568">Over and over again, the court said it was the First Amendment and we’re dealing with pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.616" offset="11857795">We’re really dealing with pure speech; we’re talking about the right of a person to just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.680" offset="11890082">It’s got nothing to do with any of the conduct cases in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.990" offset="11907323">We’re not talking about anything that’s peripheral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.838" offset="11918712">We’re saying that the court has said that a man has the right to satisfy his curiosity, to get information from sexual material by reading what is explicit as explicit as it can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.896" offset="11982973">So that, I don’t see how the opinion really could’ve been any clearer that it was bottomed on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.414" offset="12021008">The entire argument about the right to receive information and ideas, the court wasn’t right talking abstractly, I suppose, we were talking within the framework of Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.179" offset="12072103">Stanley had a film which was explicitly sexual and the court said he had the right to possess it, he had the right to view it and he had the right to receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.505" offset="12121422">All of that is traditional, clean First Amendment arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.057" offset="12147649">So that the attempt of the government now to bootleg in a Fourth Amendment argument is really as has been suggested before an attempt on the part of the Solicitor General to make the concurring opinion, the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.598" offset="12217762">It was before the court, Mr. Justice Stewart wanted to go off on the search and seizure privacy aspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.810" offset="12254647">The court went off absolutely on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.805" offset="12270634">The text which precedes footnote 11 of the opinion states, that this case is decided under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and then the footnote points out the kind of illustration that the Solicitor General gave and that as Mr. Justice Marshall said, that does not mean that a person has the right of privacy in his home to have such things as sort of shotguns or dope or other things, but he does have the right under the First Amendment to have books and films because they are protected expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.716" offset="12566235">Virtually, everyone of the thoughts expressed in Stanley has found reflection in the Lockhart Commission report which was a study as Your Honors know of some two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.277" offset="12636453">For example, in Stanley, it was stated that there was no evidence that the reading or viewing of obscene material had any anti-social effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.718" offset="12694235">That’s exactly what the commission concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.760" offset="12702386">The commission stated, empirical investigations supports the opinion of a substantial majority of persons professionally engaged in the subject that exposure to sexually explicit materials has no harmful causal role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.069" offset="12775633">I go on to say that it appears to be a usual and harmless part of the process of growing up in our society and a frequent and non-damaging occurrence among adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.807" offset="12834565">The commission report also stated that this explicit material which was thought to be totally valueless in fact does have a great deal of value that many persons find that they are benefited by having exposure to this material, and I suspect that this was part of what was meant in Stanley when the court said that Mr. Stanley had the right to satisfy his emotional and his intellectual needs by viewing this motion picture film which was plainly extraordinarily explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.758" offset="13002376">The commission also found that a majority of people in this country believed that adults are to be able to read and view this explicit material if they so choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.720" offset="13062248">The commission also found that a majority of the people believed that minors ought not be exposed to such material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.625" offset="13097880">The commission addressed itself to the question of morality which has been discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.870" offset="13122853">And also came up with the conclusion and with some arguments that I think are persuasive, that historically and consistent with the First Amendment, there simply is no power in government to try and control the morality of individuals or society by reason of what goes into their heads as opposed to the conduct of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.507" offset="13233403">The argument has been made here in the brief and by the Solicitor General that you have to have a stopping of this material at the board and because otherwise you don’t know how the material will be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.813" offset="13298604">That’s exactly the argument that the state made in the Georgia case, Georgia argued that if the state was powerless to get the material while it was at the home, then there would be difficulty of law enforcement and this court said that has never been thought to be a sufficient reason to interfere with the great rights that we’re being asserted in Stanley and those great rights again were the right to satisfy an intellectual and emotional need of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.701" offset="13430157">Now there is a statute, an interesting provision which I believe also supports the argument we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.607" offset="13461817">Although the government has sought to use it somewhere differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.819" offset="13482611">The provision I have reference to is the so called discretionary clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.324" offset="13504658">There is in this customs law a provision which says that the secretary of the treasury in his absolute discretion can permit the so called “classics” to be brought into this country, if they are brought in for non-commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.840" offset="13582712">There is no limits on the discretion that can be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.037" offset="13615522">Now, the government argues, of course that provision doesn’t mean anything now because under the opinions of this court, if the obscenity is a classic, it has redeeming social value and therefore it’s protected so there’s no need for the exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.768" offset="13954487">Perhaps, this was broad argument Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.684" offset="13978102">The argument has been made by the Solicitor General that the appellee here does not have standing to attack the statute on its face because, as it quite properly points out we did stipulate that the material was to be used commercially under the limitations that we have spoken about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.630" offset="14069844">The Solicitor General doesn’t deny the general rule that where there is a statute which affects First Amendment Rights that you don’t have to show that the particular conduct is covered by the person who raises the fact, that this statute is unconstitutionally broad because of its possible chilling effects upon freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.152" offset="14163989">But the Solicitor General says, there’s an additional requirement, the statute must not only be overbroad but it must be vague and he says this statute of course is a model of clarity and there is no vagueness in this customs law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.239" offset="14216338">Now, I submit that if we do have to have both over breadth and vagueness, we have over breadth and we do have vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.547" offset="14249566">I doubt that there is a federal statute that is more vague than the obscenity statute, plus the fact that the lying that the government suggest is a lying between commercial and non-commercial without any attempts to refine how that might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.985" offset="14323336">For example, there are cases which say that it’s really not commercial as a person just charges what it costs him for example, one would look at that as possibly commercial or possibly not commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.936" offset="14371088">The truth of the matter is that the obscenity -- this customs obscenity law is vague as well as being overbroad and that the appellee does in fact have the standing to challenge it and that the court was quite the court below was quite proper in stating that if there was any way that the statute could be applied in violation of constitutional rights, then it should be stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.129" offset="14483937">I hasten to add that we also contended below and we contend here that the court below should have reached the other view, also that it was not only unconstitutional for the reason given that it would interfere with the right of consenting adults to import obscene material but it was also unconstitutional, we contend because it interfered with the specific conduct that appellee was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.123" offset="14607862">That is to say to put the pictures into a hard-covered book for distribution to consenting adults only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.525" offset="14637432">That we believe is the correct construction that the limitations rather that Congress has and that the any statute that went beyond that would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.212" offset="14704201">So that, it is our position that the court below was plainly right on the ground that it decided the case and that it was also in order to go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.409" offset="14752998">I see my time is up and I would only say that on the point of procedure, the Freedman versus Maryland, the vice that this court found in the mailbox case with regard to time is equally applicable in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3686.986" offset="14851323">In the time I have available, I want to make only two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.648" offset="14869922">First in my principal argument, I said that I was not aware of any cases which had taken our view with respect to Stanley and on that I was wrong, I think it is a mechanic of the Solicitor General’s office that I see the case if we lose and don’t see the cases if we win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.642" offset="14957902">There are in fact three decisions of Courts of Appeals, all of which I think can be distinguished somewhere on their facts, one of them is a clear case of pandering and another could be said to be pandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.427" offset="15013073">But the Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit have all held that Stanley should not be enlarged and with the court’s permission, I will submit a memorandum to the clerk which gives the citations in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.927" offset="15079111">I would like only to read from Judge Sobeloff's opinion in United States against Melvin in 419 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.255" offset="15112443">The cases Stanley against Georgia decided this year and relied upon by the appellant is not to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.642" offset="15137938">There the Supreme Court merely stuck down the statute as unconstitutional, insofar as it made criminal, the mere private possession of obscene material in one’s own home, the decision did not deal with congressional power to regulate the interstate transportation of obscene material by common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.807" offset="15214634">And then finally, there is a three-judge district court decision in--</text>

            <text syncTime="3782.772" offset="15234487">No, that happens to be a transport by common carrier case which is like the next case we’re going to present to the court which is mail but I think the principle of the extended Stanley is exactly parallel in all of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.157" offset="15308048">Yes, Mr. Justice in the United States against Melvin, the one to which I just referred 419 federal second, 136 a Fourth Circuit decision, Fragus against United States 428 F.2d 1211, a Fifth Circuit decision and plainly involving pandering and Miller against the United States 431 F.2d 655 a Ninth Circuit decision and then I would like to refer to the decision of a three-judge district court in Georgia, Gable against Jenkins, 309 federal supplement 998, which also took a narrower or a non-expensive view of Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.241" offset="15520371">It was appealed to this court and this court affirmed the decision below per curiam in 397 U.S 205 and that should surely have been cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.445" offset="15581184">I would like only to say in conclusion that I think there is verbal explanations for these words in the Stanley opinion which have caused us trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.365" offset="15624861">The court in Stanley said and spoke twice of the right to receive information or ideas but in the Roth decision, the court said that obscenity is not ideas or information and so that language in Stanley may have been very carefully chosen to exclude the right to receive obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.019" offset="15711483">It’s true that in the Stanley case, the court said--</text>

            <text syncTime="3915.676" offset="15766026">Two members of the court who thought the probably jurisdiction should be noted but the court affirmed the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.908" offset="15803016">In the Stanley case, it is true that the court said it would not decide whether the movies in Stanley had ideational content that is constituted information and ideas under the facts of that case because of the risk to Stanley’s First Amendment rights inherent in that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.088" offset="15895698">But that again, returned one to Stanley’s right not to have his thoughts pride into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.167" offset="15920044">We need not concede and do not that the right to receive information and ideas referred to in the Stanley opinion included the films there involved.</text>
