            <text syncTime="49.955" offset="303208">John Harry Bruno was born and raised in the Borough of Norristown which is about 20 miles west of Philadelphia and the records in this case show that he attended public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.532" offset="365484">It was elicited to the various hearings, habeas corpus hearings, suppression hearings, insanity hearings that he had never been in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.485" offset="405295">Low and behold, he was drafted by the United States Army in November of 1961 and at some point during his basic training, abbreviated as it was, it was determined that John was unlike the other draftees that he was sick and he was transferred to Fitzsimons General Hospital in Denver, Colorado where he was in a psychiatric ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.163" offset="520025">He was discharged by the United States Army in May of 1961 and sent home by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.863" offset="562866">Now prior to that, a murder had taken place in October of 1961 in Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, husband and wife were killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.551" offset="617618">Subsequent to John's discharge from the army, he held jobs in Norristown.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.013" offset="647398">He was not in any trouble that anybody knows of, although the records does show that subsequent to December of 1963 when two other people were murdered, John was interrogated by the county detectives and/or the District Attorney's Office and now it's 1964 and given a lie detector test.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.713" offset="1090226">As Mr. Justice Roberts said, at that first appeal in the State Supreme Court, “How in the world can they can take an illegal confession and hold it here, and say, if John Bruno did these terrible things for the reasons that he gave for doing them, then he must be crazy.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.560" offset="10057644">We suggest to the Court that we do have a conflict between the right of a fair trial and the right of a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.293" offset="10092544">There are numerous reasons why we would not want to subject the defendant to the speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.571" offset="10113651">The Court has definitely that to proceed and prosecute a defendant who was incompetent violates due process and we are not violating the right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.481" offset="10161298">We are merely differing it until such time that the defendant can exercise in conjunction with his counsel, the personal constitutional rights that he must decide upon during the course of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.611" offset="10213857">We feel that the standards by which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania proceeds in matters of this type afford him every protection and we therefore suggest to this Court that this defendant is not competent and not able to proceed for trial, in spite of the recommendations or assertions of his defense counsel.</text>
