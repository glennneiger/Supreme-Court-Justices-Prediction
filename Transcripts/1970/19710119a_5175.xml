            <text syncTime="1364.700" offset="5562180">And in addition to what I pointed out as to the criminal sanctions vis-à-vis, the financial responsibility in my argument that the statute really does not protect the public to ensure the safe driver’s drive on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.479" offset="5641279">I think one question which a lot of people would have in mind is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.345" offset="5664789">You know, we can’t allow these people to drive, get into an accident, wipe out the judgment by bankruptcy and drive again and what’s going to prevent them from doing this over and over again?</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.013" offset="5711391">The answer, of course, is that it won’t happen over and over again because the Arizona statute also provides that in order for Adolfo Perez to get his license again, and not only must he pay the debt, but he must also show that he has insurance for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.139" offset="5787878">And the Perez’s are more than willing to pay insurance for the future, and therefore, if allowed to drive, they’ll be actually financially more responsible than some of the drivers on the streets and highways in Arizona who have no insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.967" offset="5867290">Another thing we must point out in -- or to demonstrate that the statute is not for the purposes of public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.995" offset="5927372">I’d like to quote the Arizona Supreme Court decision in Schecter v. Killingsworth and this decision was cited both by myself and my opponent, and the Arizona court in that case that came out in interpreting the Financial Responsibility Act of Arizona saying that the state statute does not have for its primary purpose the purpose of public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.204" offset="6088182">The Arizona court said, the Financial Responsibility Act has for its purpose, the principle purpose, the protection of the public using the highways from financial hardship which may result from the use of automobiles by financially irresponsible persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.325" offset="6160697">It accomplishes the objective by requiring proof of financial responsibility by those involved in an accident, either by showing of insurance which covers the accident or by requiring a bond or deposit or cash, or security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.365" offset="6212838">It may as incidental purpose and effect because of the threat of loss of driving arise following an insured accident, one, encourage operators of motor vehicle to obtain liability insurance and two, encourage drivers to drive more carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.253" offset="6284413">Because the uninsured motorist can avoid the adverse effect of a statute without obtaining insurance and without improving his driving skills, we cannot either -- we cannot consider either the encouragement to obtain insurance or the improvement of the safety conditions on the highways to be the primary objective of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.627" offset="6385873">And this point was omitted by the respondent in their brief as the proper interpretation of the Arizona statute placed by the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.880" offset="6446895">And therefore, it is a well established doctrine that in such a case, the federal court must be bound by the interpretation placed by the state’s highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.013" offset="6515440">I'll just cite one case decided by this Court on that point, the Marine National Exchange Bank versus Kalt-Zimmers Manufacturing Company in 293 U.S. 357.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.058" offset="6575626">That case, it’s also a case involving bankruptcy and it involves another uniform law, the Negotiable Instrument Act, and involves the construction by the state court as to what is at holder in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.721" offset="6638216">And this Court said that not withstanding the weight of thought to the contrary, the federal court is bound by the interpretation placed by the Wisconsin court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.144" offset="6699969">I’d like to point out again that Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his opinion, at the time when he felt the driving is not important, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said that the -- in fact, it’s only tangential as to a driving that only in particular cases when one seeks to drive to restore his driver’s license and registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.960" offset="6803205">I submit that this is no longer true that in this day when driving is such an important right as said by the Arizona Supreme Court again in the same case Schecter versus Killingsworth, when Arizona overruled a prior decision and said “driving is no longer privileged for the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.549" offset="6885543">And I submit that every person whose license is suspended will seek to have his license restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.565" offset="6905605">Therefore, the effect of a statute is no longer a tangential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.066" offset="6919607">It is very direct and complete and its impact on the Bankruptcy Act is again complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.113" offset="6943848">I would like to call attention to this Court as to a recent case decided by the Third Circuit on December 22, 1970 dealing with a point whether an owner who was vicariously liable would have his license suspended, and then after bankruptcy can he get the benefit of the bankruptcy by having his license restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.214" offset="7052204">The Third Circuit held that his license should be restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.257" offset="7068400">A later, Second Circuit case, decided a couple of weeks ago, reached a contrary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.715" offset="7098284">I have not read the Second Circuit opinion, but I like to quote the opinion by the Third Circuit, the opinion by seven judges out of nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.091" offset="7139767">The opinion said “Nor is the disability of disqualification from owning or operating a motor vehicle and essentially tangential impingement upon the purposes served by Section 17 of Bankruptcy Act, one cannot ignore the facts of present day urban existence, a combination of public and private policies have made use of an automobile an actual necessity for virtually everyone who must work for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.206" offset="7252198">For the urban poor in particular, remoteness from the thriving suburban segments of the industry, economy and a deteriorating public transportation system often make use of an automobile, the only practical alternative to welfare.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.122" offset="7579878">I might first state that as the Court is well aware, there have been two women’s lib groups who have filed amicus curiae in this particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.357" offset="7620838">I did not respond to the amicus curiae in my answering brief for the simple reason that the notification concerning the granting of the original amicus curiae brief was not received until my brief was in preparation on its way to the printers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.022" offset="7691473">Notification as to the second one of which I feel a response, a written response would definitely is more deserve it, was not received in my office until January 13 this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.402" offset="7741001">For that reason, I will attempt to cover these briefs in oral argument, especially the one from the organization located in Tucson, Arizona and would request that if the Court deemed necessary as based upon different citations, which I will utilize in the oral argument that they might see fit to grant leave to file either an additional authorities and/or maybe a short answering brief directed towards the amicus curiae briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.305" offset="7848626">I would like first to briefly and devote actually a much smaller portion of my argument to the overall issue as challenge concerning the -- whether or not to overrule Kesler and Reitz and reserve a primary portion of my argument or rather at the latter port -- part of the argument, go into the issue concerning Emma, which is by far the more novel and interesting issue possibly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.788" offset="7950503">Now as Mr. Ching has pointed out and has stated and I think in both briefs that various lip service has been given to the type of statute which is challenged here, the type of statute which is challenged here has been enacted at least at one time in 45 or more of our states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.619" offset="8017899">This is based on a Uniform Act with local state adoptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.229" offset="8032319">The public purposes justifying such statutes have been enumerated as follows: One, a deterrent to unsafe driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.259" offset="8072443">Number two; a very nebulous to protect others using the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.742" offset="8090311">Number three and as mentioned most specifically by Arizona, to keep persons who may be injured by the financially irresponsible utilizing of the highways off of our welfare roles and four; the mention has been made to encourage insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.664" offset="8161991">Arizona does can at least state that in their estimation, the primary purpose of this particular statute in the Arizona Supreme Court’s estimation when they wrote the Schecter case was to keep persons who may be injured by the financially irresponsible off the welfare roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.327" offset="8244642">Gentlemen, I don’t think that whether Arizona states that, they also did mention the incidental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.321" offset="8268675">I don’t think that Arizona’s placing its emphasis as far as it was concerned on that particular element or alleged public purpose in anyway should govern whether or not this statute is held constitutional or unconstitutional or violative or un-violative of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.539" offset="8349550">The reason why I say that is, this is the -- challenged portion of this statute is all but verbatim, the statute which was challenged in Reitz and the statute which was challenged in Kesler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.554" offset="8401586">And because Arizona says “Of the various purposes, we happen to think this one is the more valid” is no reason for this Court to feel that we are talking about a different statute.</text>

Conversely as pointed out in all these briefs filed by the amicus curiae women’s lib groups, conversely by that very own Arizona opinion, Mrs. Perez did no right to control what Mr. Perez did because she has no right to control the utilization of community property contrary to her husband’s wishes, and consequently could not have been held liable.</text>
