            <text syncTime="74.200" offset="400175">This case involves the conviction of the appellant and it's an appeal by the appellant from his conviction in the New York courts for casting contempt on the flag of the United States by exhibiting in his art gallery certain sculptures.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.610" offset="465795">The issues involve the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.444" offset="477184">They involve the Fourteenth Amendment in the terms of whether the statute is sufficiently clear and definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.984" offset="507277">They involve the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment because of a situation where there is an exemption in the statute for the exhibition, or for the portrayal or photographs of these same sculptures in newspapers and periodicals, and for the display of paintings using a flag motive in art galleries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.463" offset="609259">The appellant was the proprietor of an art gallery on the second floor of a building on Madison Avenue in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.860" offset="638830">The gallery was recognized in the art world and specialized in exhibits of sculpture.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.065" offset="663594">In the appellant's gallery, he exhibited certain sculptures or constructions as they are called by an artist named Mark Murrell.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.983" offset="699329">The artist Murrell is not a defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.938" offset="715107">The sculptures were made of fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.670" offset="726079">Some of which were of what appeared to be the American flag or may have been actual flags, the record is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.929" offset="759097">One of the sculptures what appeared to be a flag in the shape of a human body hanging from a yellow noose was in the second floor window of the gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.754" offset="798386">It was visible from within the gallery, and also to passersby on Madison Avenue who happen to look up to the -- up from the street to the second floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.386" offset="996916">The other sculptures were visible only in the art gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.742" offset="1010291">The art gallery was open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.746" offset="1022307">Seven of the sculptures are the subject of this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.953" offset="1039235">There were 13 -- there are more seven exhibits because there's a duplication of some of the sculptures in certain of photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.903" offset="1071000">There were 13 works by Murrell in the exhibit including three paintings.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.782" offset="1090539">One of the noose figure, the same figure which was in the window and two others using the flag motive.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.273" offset="1132440">Now the appellant here was not found guilty of defacing or mutilating the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.347" offset="1152711">He was convicted only and directly of casting contempt on the flag by exhibiting seven of Murrell's sculptures.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.918" offset="1187088">The exhibition had been going on in the art gallery for two weeks when the summons were served.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.679" offset="1210075">There was no evidence of any disorder inside or outside the gallery or of any circumstances that might lead to disorder, nor of any complaints of disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.237" offset="1252289">Only the defendant and one other person were in the art gallery when the police visited.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.679" offset="1302131">The courts below held that no showing of disorder or any threat of disorder was necessary for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.840" offset="1330761">The circular announcing the exhibition which is the defendant's exhibit B which is also with the exhibits, was sent to the defendant's regular mailing list of collectors, of museum people, the press, universities and art departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.293" offset="1388544">It announced simply an exhibition of constructions by Mark Murrell and gave the dates and place of the exhibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.842" offset="1446745">War protest songs were played on a tape recorder in the gallery while the works were on exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.191" offset="1472136">The sale arrangement was the customary New York Art Gallery arrangement whereby the dealer receives a commission of thirty-three and third percent of the sale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.449" offset="1513200">The appellant who had been in the art gallery business for 14 years and has a degree in Fine Arts from Columbia, and Hilton Kramer who was the art news editor of the New York Times and who reviewed the Murrell exhibit for that newspaper testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.915" offset="1579029">They testified that modern day artists use various materials in their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.597" offset="1597733">They use fabric, metal, wood, paint, pieces of junk and that they mix them in the same work.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.520" offset="1625422">And that today, there is no longer a difference between two dimensional and three dimensional works between painting, sculpture or so called mixed works.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.061" offset="1663666">They testified also that they consider the Murrell constructions to be works of art of the genre known generally is "Protest Art."</text>
            <text syncTime="398.340" offset="1696684">Kramer the critic, said that he personally was more interested in the aesthetic qualities of the work than in the political protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.321" offset="1728658">The defendant testified that he had no intent to cast contempt on the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.478" offset="1749243">He testified also that he thought the artist, Murrell, did not intend any contempt for the flag, but that actually what the artist was dong was questioning the behavior of others, who he thought were using the flag for aggressive purposes.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Green</label>
            <text syncTime="427.172" offset="1812041">No sir, he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.493" offset="1821341">The New York statute is subdivision 16d of Section 1425 of the old penal law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.470" offset="1857285">It is now on in Section 136 of the general business law.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.929" offset="1875048">The statute is frequently been termed by the courts and by others as a desecration statute, and it makes it a crime to publicly mutilate, deface, defile or defy trample upon or cast contempt by words or act.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.897" offset="1938996">There is no logic to the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.638" offset="1945893">The flag is not mentioned, but presumably that's what's intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.906" offset="1963029">This Court in the Street case read the phrase by words out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.276" offset="1984449">Now, we contend first that appellant's conviction violates the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.862" offset="2014856">That the First Amendment prohibits punishment for exhibition of sculpture on the ground that it is contemptuous of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.911" offset="2047039">It is important I think for the Court to note here that so far as this appellant is concerned, the statute is directed solely at communication of an idea or an attitude, casting contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.336" offset="2100746">He was convicted only of casting contempt on the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.455" offset="2121226">Now the lumping of the term casting contempt in the statute with physical acts of mutilation and defacement may perhaps tend to obscure this, as perhaps also does the existence of the legal concept of contempt of court which is a different concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.964" offset="2199280">But the fundamental fact here is that this statute is directed entirely at communication at casting contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.079" offset="2231672">That being so, we do not believe it can stand under the First Amendment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="536.400" offset="2249017">That would be true of a contempt of court too, would it not, where the contempt was charged was based on utterances or other expressions?</text>

            <text syncTime="548.796" offset="2298546">I think not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.955" offset="2303143">I think that in the case of contempt of court, the concept is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.872" offset="2318817">The concept is one having to do with the administration of justice and it isn't -- it directed toward the administration of justice and the function of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.093" offset="2355702">And I was talking -- to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.254" offset="2364374">The act of the person charged is alleged at least to be his utterance, and in that respect, do you see a difference?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Green</label>
            <text syncTime="576.202" offset="2408155">Yes, I see a difference Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.768" offset="2414425">For example in the Pennekamp case and in the Bridges case, the contempt of court thing is related directly to the process of the court to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.685" offset="2454131">In Bridges and in Pennekamp for example where there were comments which could be held to be contemptuous in a sense of communication of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.024" offset="2487463">Nonetheless, there was no contempt of court in a legal sense and I think therefore that there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.197" offset="2520168">Now, that being so, we don't believe that this conviction the statute can stand under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.264" offset="2544410">We intend to show to the Court that this case involves pure speech under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.110" offset="2567816">But even if we treat these sculptures as an act, as conduct, what we have here is a statute that prohibits not the act, but the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.151" offset="2612015">Now if we assume for the moment that these sculptures or their exhibition or conduct, this case is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.654" offset="2642004">It's quite the opposite of the ordinary so called symbolic speech case.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.768" offset="2662484">In the usual symbolic speech case, the statute on its face prohibits conduct which the state has a right to prohibit and the defendant comes in and argues that since he employed that conduct for communicative purposes, then the First Amendment prohibits the application of the statute to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.979" offset="2743254">That's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.870" offset="2750882">In this case, the point of the statute under which appellant has been convicted prohibits communication; communication of an idea, contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.941" offset="2791111">And if it's applied to symbolic conduct, it would be applied to the communicative aspect of the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.533" offset="2817546">What the statute prohibits here is the communicative aspect of the conduct and not the conduct itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.268" offset="2848475">Hence, even if we assume that this is not pure speech, the question before the Court would therefore be not whether conduct prohibited by a statute is protected by the First Amendment, but whether the Constitution permits a statue to be directed entirely at communication, solely because the means of communication could be an act subject to state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.119" offset="2951816">Now, we do contend however that we are dealing here with speech not with so called symbolic speech, or with conduct akin to speech and we contend further that this case is governed by this Court's holding in Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.132" offset="3011897">We submit that painting and sculpture are speech as that term is used in the First Amendment as much as words.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.325" offset="3044707">We submit, we point out to the Court that the earliest form of writing was picture writing, cut or drawn on stone, long before men could write words.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.477" offset="3089324">Photographs and cartoons for example have always been considered writing in the law of defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.720" offset="3118268">It is our contention that works of art, whether they are books, motion pictures, cartoons, paintings or sculpture are protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.167" offset="3160064">These sculptures we say are therefore entitled to the same protection as the words in Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.839" offset="3190680">Now, works of art have traditionally been used to express political protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.013" offset="3211473">In the Instant case, the courts below have found that these sculptures were political protests.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.197" offset="3236133">At the same time, we don't discount our contention of all works of art, whether or not they communicate a political message, are protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.478" offset="3285243">Now, it should be noted here that the statutory language which forbids casting contempt on the flag precludes punishment of an artist for using the flag to praise United States policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.148" offset="3335920">On its face, the statute permits the artist to use the flag in support of United States policy, but forbids them to use it if he would condemn U.S. policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.117" offset="3375835">Whether he would condemn it in the case of the Vietnam War as overly aggressive or is insufficiently so, if he would condemn U.S. policy, he is forbidden to use the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.944" offset="3423169">Now this is essentially the same vice which this Court condemned in Shack where the statute permitted the use of the United States military uniform in theatrical productions, only if it did not discredit the particular armed force.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.222" offset="3484296">This prohibition of derogatory use clearly violates the First Amendment and First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.490" offset="3517315">We argue also that the only governmental interest furthered by this New York statute is compelling respect for the flag, an interest which cannot be furthered without violating the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.072" offset="3571649">In Street, this Court suggested four possible interests which might support the state's prohibition of Street's contemptuous words.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.041" offset="3607489">We believe that we have demonstrated in our briefs that none of these possible interests can support this conviction, just as they could not support the conviction of Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.970" offset="3647300">Appellee and the New York Court of Appeals nonetheless have urged that the function of the statute is one to assure respect for our national emblem, and two, to prevent breaches of the peace and that these are valid state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.336" offset="3712711">As to assuring respect for our national emblem, Street and Barnett have made it clear that compelling respect for our flag is an interest that has no place in a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.954" offset="3763179">It is extremely significant I think Your Honors that this statute is commonly referred to as a desecration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.957" offset="3795153">Actually, the effect of the statute is really to create the crime of secular or patriotic sacrilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.054" offset="3827545">The statue in effect makes a religious object, a secular icon out of the flag, but in our country, we submit under our constitution, we have not place for sacred items or totems.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.824" offset="3882715">No one can be compelled to respect or pay obeisance to any symbol, religious or secular.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.370" offset="3908838">That is something that is reserved for totalitarian states.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.538" offset="4069543">In other words, I think desecration gets into the same problem as casting contempt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Green</label>
            <text syncTime="1041.709" offset="4270164">Well in this case, our appellant was convicted only of casting contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.740" offset="4286360">He was not convicted of mutilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.685" offset="4294092">He was not convicted of defacing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.322" offset="4304645">So that what we have here and I think I had assumed that perhaps this was one reason the Court particularly was interested in this case, was that you have clearly and directly the communicative aspect, because the words of which -- the thing that he was convicted of was casting contempt on the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.353" offset="4392835">Now, the court below and the appellee also seek to justify the statute as one intended to prevent breaches of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.892" offset="4426898">However, there's nothing in the design of the statute to suggest that as its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.860" offset="4446856">Subdivision 16 of the -- it is in a really a great conglomeration of the statutes which are all lumped in Section 1425 of the former penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.066" offset="4495653">They have to do with things as varied as skating on someone's commercial ice pond or taking somebody's oysters and I think in one case, there's business of stealing firearms from a National Guard armory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.056" offset="4543613">It is not a breach of the peace statute anymore than the statute in Stromberg was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.375" offset="4564825">Furthermore, the statute is neither phrased nor has it been construed to require a finding of a public disturbance or an immanent breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.996" offset="4599306">In fact, it's been construed as not to require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.321" offset="4612681">The court below simply assumes a possible breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.604" offset="4629817">In effect, what the court below has done has been to create by fiat, a heckles veto even when as in this case, there are no hecklers, none in sight; none suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.822" offset="4682689">Now, New York it should be noted does have a breach of the peace statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.323" offset="4704632">Now, we say also that unlike for example, the situations in O'Brien and in Aderlee, there is no governmental interest here which is entirely distinct from the suppression of the ideas expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.431" offset="4761057">Here, the statute's direct thrust is at communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.111" offset="4779865">Preventing a breach of the peace is used only as a justification for suppressing the communication of the idea of contempt, not as a governmental interest independent of the suppression of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.094" offset="4835767">Hence, since we are dealing with communication with First Amendment rights, the states' first duty is to protect the communicator and only as a last resort can it intervene against him when it has demonstrated an actual danger of a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.705" offset="4906193">There was no such danger here, nor was there any attempt to show one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.956" offset="4923225">And the courts below have held that there is no need to show one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.365" offset="4940884">Now, appellee suggests for the first time in this Court that the conviction can also be sustained on an assault theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.577" offset="4973693">The theory of assault on a captive audience, but there was no captive audience here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.188" offset="4996159">No one had to climb the stairs to appellant's second floor gallery to see this exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.740" offset="5022281">And as for the noose figure in the second floor window, if a passerby happened to glance up to the second floor in the Madison Avenue traffic, all he had to do is redirect his eyes to street level far less than he would have had to do to avoid Mr. Street, or to avoid the sidewalk speaker who is suggested in the appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.677" offset="5114128">This case is not in any way like for example Rowan against the United States Post Office which had to do with a householder is right to stop communications addressed to him in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.695" offset="5166164">The assault theory therefore is inappropriate to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.725" offset="5186226">The case was not and could not have been tried on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.257" offset="5204407">No evidence of assault was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.828" offset="5214647">The state did not raise this contention on prior appeals, nor did the courts below base their findings on holding on such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.606" offset="5249755">The trial court simply found that the defendant cast contempt by exhibiting these seven sculptures of Murrell's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.365" offset="5280789">We state also that the New York statute is unclear, uncertain and overbroad on its face, so much so as to violate this appellant's Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.616" offset="5329795">I do not here want to repeat the detailed argument on this point which is in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.381" offset="5352887">However, I think the Court need only look at the recent history of litigation in the various federal courts and in the state courts involving this and similar statutes, they're almost all pretty much the same in other states, to see how vague and imprecise the statute is and how it invites uneven application by local officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.409" offset="5440972">The one fact that stands out clearly from all these various cases is that no one really knows what is legal and what is illegal under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.754" offset="5482350">For example, it defines a flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.819" offset="5494680">How many stars and how many stripes make a flag under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.945" offset="5511189">What is casting contempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.206" offset="5520175">Is it the thumbing one's nose, or making some other gesture at the flag?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.208" offset="5540237">Is it painting stripes on an automobile or flying a flag at half mast in mourning over something that a local district attorney or court does not find the cause for mourning?</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.237" offset="5588302">Or is it wrapping a flag around an oil can as in one of the editorial cartoons in the appendix to our reply brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.509" offset="5621426">The trial court here suggested that if the defendant approaches the brink of what is proscribed, he must gamble on an adverse finding by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.032" offset="5663535">Well, we submit Your Honors that this does not meet the constitutional standards that first he must know what is proscribed that the statute must provide local officials with adequate standards for its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.105" offset="5715780">That the statute must not include constitutionally protected conduct within its ambit, and that there can be no strict liability offense in the area of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.444" offset="5761128">We claim also Your Honors, that this statute defies appellant equal protection in that it permits newspaper and magazine publishers to show photos of the same sculptures, to print cartoons and paintings on similar subjects and it permits the exhibition of paintings that use the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.932" offset="5835107">The statute has an exemption for on the metal pictures, for newspapers and periodicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.989" offset="5855378">Murrell’s paintings were not included in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.039" offset="5867499">At the time of the sentencing, we called to the attention of the court, a painting in the collection of Governor Rockefeller, which was then on public exhibition in New York City, which consists, it’s a collage, it is a painting of the flag on which have been imposed picture of potatoes, the words Iowa, New York, used fork and a picture of Governor Rockefeller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.929" offset="5967078">That painting was then on public display in New York City, it was used as the circular for the advertising that exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.085" offset="5999679">It was used as the cover of the New York Times Sunday magazine during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.761" offset="6022457">As a matter of fact, it was hanging in the executive mansion in Albany when we argued this case in the Court of Appeals, and when I called that to the attention of the court, Judge Full suggested that they had enough trouble with this case without our getting into Governor Rockefeller’s painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.423" offset="6081076">But the point is that the flag is permitted to be used in paintings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.091" offset="6095705">It is permitted to be used in any way contemptuous or non-contemptuous in magazines, in newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.490" offset="6133321">We have all of these various uses and we say that such a distinction discriminates against sculpture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.638" offset="6161951">Now, appellee suggests that the statute permits only non-contemptuous use of the flag in paintings and periodicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.007" offset="6191417">But there's nothing in the statute that limits the exemption to non-contemptuous use of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.385" offset="6212942">And as the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit pointed out, construing another subdivision of this statute and holding it invalid, while the court would try to avoid constitutional issues if it can, it just can't go out of its way, and to do it as would be required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.925" offset="6283055">Now in fact here at the trial interestingly, appellee conceded that if the artwork here had been painting rather than sculpture, it would've been exempt from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.901" offset="6326941">Furthermore to our knowledge, the statute has never been applied to paintings, newspapers or periodicals despite the many, many examples of such use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.613" offset="6377827">Now Your Honor, I would like to save some of my time for rebuttal and I will stop to this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.283" offset="6700492">There was no seizure of the flag constructions and the proof of guilt was established primarily by photographs taken at the gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.966" offset="6747199">These photographs are included in the original record and Mr. Seaver is been kind enough to obtain them here in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.334" offset="6796727">I think it might be convenient if these are passed up to the Court because I'd like to refer to them, some of them during my oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.278" offset="6856495">The immediate question presented by this case is the extent to which the people while preserving the liberties that the flag stands for may also take steps to preserve the integrity of the flag as a national symbol of general use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.467" offset="6925249">Whatever place this case finds in constitutional history, will probably be attributable however to a broader question and that is the difficult balancing between pure speech and symbolic conduct that has attracted the attention of this Court in several cases in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.587" offset="7029739">Because the statute here in question involves casting contempt by act and the trial court specifically found that the appellant's constructions or the display of these constructions cast contempt by act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.389" offset="7108942">Every state has a statute in some way of prescribing the acts which maybe addressed to the flag.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.974" offset="8151228">It may have been that Congress felt that the states were better equipped through local law enforcement to deal with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.078" offset="8175679">In Halter against Nebraska in 1907, this Court said that the state does have an interest, because the states derive their existence from the union and the flag represents that union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.146" offset="8227924">Four members of this Court in dissent in the Street case appear to have accepted the state interest in this area and the recent congressional law specifically leaves to the states the power to make these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.592" offset="8305768">The ability of a state or federal government to regulate conduct that has expressive elements was recognized in the O'Brien case, the draft card burning case, and there are two main tests set forth in that case which we contend were fulfilled here to justify the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.273" offset="8404511">The first is that there be a sufficient governmental interest in regulating the conduct element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.110" offset="8439829">And if this interest exists, an incidental affect on some expressive element maybe tolerated under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.391" offset="8480893">And the second principle requirement is that the regulation not be directed to suppression of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.018" offset="8519450">As we proceed to argue, both of these tests were satisfied by the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.602" offset="8557798">One governmental interest which is served by the New York law, the federal law and the laws in all of the other states is the preservation of the integrity of the flag as a viable national symbol for general use by all of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.506" offset="8633448">As was said in dissent in the Street case, the flag is a special kind of personalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.145" offset="8667930">It is dedicated to a certain use by public action and as such, it is off limits for certain physical acts of destruction or contemptuous desecration in public, just as the walls of a federal building are off limits for the inscription of political or social commentary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.069" offset="8915675">And indeed, this Court has never suggested that there is no valid public interest in preserving this general symbolic use of the flag as a national symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.098" offset="8975757">The more difficult question here is whether the New York law is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.288" offset="9016508">I'm talking now of the specific provision that is at issue here, the provision preventing casting contempt on the flag by an act, because contempt is in a sense expression and that expression is specifically the corpus of the crime that is defined by this statute, but this contempt is not a view on an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.908" offset="9143045">The flag is neutral on political and social questions, and the statutes aimed at protecting the flag by the same token are also neutral in terms of expressing views of the type that are recognized as having value in the free marketplace of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.480" offset="9233324">The flag has its place at the head of a parade of hard hats and it has its place at the head of a procession of peace marchers, so that the legislation dealing with the flag takes no position on political questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.691" offset="9334157">The law does not say that you may not cast contempt on the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.694" offset="9498102">As the statute was applied in this particular case, there is another interest which is certainly as important as the interest in permitting free-floating abstract contempt by acts toward the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.216" offset="9568214">And that is the interest in freedom of choice of the citizens as to whether they shall have in their community publicly displayed uses of the flag that are offensive to a large part of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.039" offset="9755564">It is absurd to suggest that there is no evidence that this was visible to many persons passing on Madison Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.644" offset="9805928">And the question here is whether the ability to rent space in a prominent display position, gives the right to put in there any visual materials for any amount of time regardless of other means of presenting the same expression in manners which are less of an assault on the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.527" offset="9925465">The very basic right to be free from sights and tangible matter that we do not want was the language used recently by this Court in Rowan against Post Office; that involved privacy in the home, but there is privacy, some interest in privacy and freedom of choice in the public streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.203" offset="10016162">If this law is applied in such a context, there is no substantial question of the subject's rights under the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.933" offset="13679156">That is in volume 3 of the Indiana legal forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.270" offset="13748433">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.376" offset="13760867">There was a mention in the argument of the appellee of the Stover case in New York, the rags on the clotheslines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.535" offset="13797543">I would just like to point out to the Court that there, there was no question of a valid statutory purpose apart from communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.096" offset="13827741">What we had was a statute which forbade clotheslines in any yard abutting on a public street, and the statute was upheld under the general zoning and police powers of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.706" offset="13874239">Here of course, the statute is addressed entirely to communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.966" offset="13895241">On the subject of provocation, there was a question asked about the possibility of soldiers throwing stones through the second floor window of this gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.267" offset="13940485">Of course, there was no evidence at all here of any disorder or of any threat of disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.340" offset="13960756">However, if there were, we would respectfully suggest to this Court that the state's first duty in that case would be to attempt to quell the disorder that undifferentiated fear of potential disorder, this Court has repeatedly held can never justify the suppression of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.084" offset="14047692">Now, appellee has concedes that one can be disrespectful of the Government, but he says that the flag is something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.082" offset="14083741">And in this regard, I should like to quote to the Court, S.I. Hayakawa, who was president of one of the California State Colleges and a renowned semanticists, speaking of the flag very recently, he sad, and I am quoting now "When a symbol becomes a fetish, then you make the semantic error of confusing the symbol with what it is supposed to symbolize."</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.192" offset="14192097">We submit Your Honors that the issue before this Court today really is a very direct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.616" offset="14217801">It is whether our flag originally designed to symbolize our heritage of freedom has now become a fetish as Mr. Hayakawa called it, whose worship can curb the very freedom that it is supposed to represent.</text>
