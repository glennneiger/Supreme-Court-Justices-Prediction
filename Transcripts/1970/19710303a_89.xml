            <text syncTime="56.257" offset="329415">This is an appeal from the dismissal of a complaint of three individual taxpayers and several organizations challenging the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute Act 109 which provides for the payment of tax money to non public schools to reimburse them for the cost of teaching mathematics, modern and foreign languages, physical science and physical education.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.272" offset="461490">The complaint, alleged violation of the First Amendment’s religious clause and of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.509" offset="502450">Three-judge court dismissed the complaint on the First Amendment grounds of the basis of a fair and steady cause of action, no answer, no discovery, no trial, no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.926" offset="552082">On the Fourteenth Amendment, ground for a lack of standing in all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.042" offset="576533">When this Act was passed, it was without precedent in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.440" offset="606208">It's scheme is simply this, any non-public school has but to fill out a form and submit it, setting forth its cost in these subjects for teacher salaries, teaching materials and for textbooks and that state forth with pays that amount over to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.458" offset="702234">The transaction is labeled, purchase of services contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.992" offset="720415">As Judge Hastie, dissenting below said, nevertheless and I quote “the state buys no services and the school sells none.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.197" offset="769212">The pedagogical status quo in Pennsylvania is precisely the same as it was before the Act, the only difference is economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.550" offset="806619">The Act provides for considerable new state regulations of the schools, the non public schools and when I say non public, it’s to be understood of course that, these are largely church affiliated schools, 97%.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.287" offset="865552">And 97% of that, 97% is Roman Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.248" offset="885405">The Act calls for inspection of textbooks for testing the pupils and for certain levels of performance and that’s new, for the certification of teachers after a passage of time and that’s new.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.171" offset="2057049">But when you get to the fundamentals of the First Amendment, Mr. Justice Harlan, I think public money is public money, makes no difference whether it's a special tax, you can't isolate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.951" offset="2096232">When there's only there to read to skim of the briefs here to become aware Your Honors and it's certainly true that the controversy here is pregnant with other issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.616" offset="2174809">On the other hand, the attackers of the bill point out at a different level that the effectiveness will be to perpetuate the effect of racial segregation that’s exemplified by the non-public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.786" offset="2231547">On still another level, the proponents say, having predicted the demise of the non-public school system that the resulting exclusively public system will be deleterious to pluralistic society and we rejoin, I suppose that what you're heading for here is a dual school system, it's act is sustained, the one primarily affluent and suburban and White and at least typically White and suburban and elitist and the other poor, inferior, practically custodial and Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.183" offset="2369160">And that there are nations that have those systems and this is what we’re heading for.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.931" offset="2384102">If we’re talking simply about the traditional doctrine, there's no precedent of course, because there's no present legislation, the cases after Shemport (ph) discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.565" offset="2434675">They lead, it seems to me that the conclusion that unless the law is to be changed, the stack must go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.965" offset="2456304">I do want to mention Bradfield, however since it's come up, Mr. Justice Blackmun, first of all yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.108" offset="2512833">As a precedent, I think Bradfield doesn’t need to troubles because rightly or wrongly, and I have a footnote which covers Bradfield in my brief at some length on page 19 and there, the Supreme Court rightly or wrongly just didn’t reach the First Amendment issue because they simply said, the fact that this corporation, a hospital corporation’s members are composed of religious people and they happen to be Catholics, doesn’t make it sectarian any more than it would if they were Methodists and they concluded, finally we are not able to say and I'm quoting, “we are not able to say that the compliant in this bill shows that the corporation is for the kind described but on the contrary, he has clearly shown it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.334" offset="2705721">Now, that doesn’t get us away from the question and the question is how about hospitals?</text>
            <text syncTime="654.167" offset="2721081">Because hospitals are in a relationship with the state and that’s true in Pennsylvania today.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.166" offset="2793075">Not if they're sectarian, that’s my understanding and here again we’re without a record so Your Honor has asked me, I was on the board of this group of hospital in Philadelphia and we added not (Inaudible) of the board, we did a number of things of that kind, we did attach ourself for all relationship with the archdiocese in order to get Hill-Burton funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.061" offset="2876667">Now, I think that’s what happens in the hospital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.304" offset="2889624">I'm speaking of the kind of thing that might be analogous to our situation, that as you treat a patient and you get paid so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.455" offset="2918254">My rationale is this, and these are the differences and I think they probably all have to exist for the hospital situation to prevail constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.058" offset="2952631">First of all, to recognize that it is not a church and the care of the sick is not a mandated, a mandated religious function, it’s part of the good work ethics of most all religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.783" offset="3011563">It doesn’t therefore teach or proselytize, it does not prefer, I don’t think exclusion is necessary, I think any distinct preference is sufficient to make it unconstitutional and finally, and most important, this is true purchase of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.523" offset="3078437">Here the purchase of service is not a subterfuge, here the status quo is not the same after as before because new, specific individuals who are discernible and could be tracked or treated who would not be treated if they were not for the use of this facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.185" offset="3141130">So I think all of those differences are important to the situation and I don’t, for one minute agree if Mr. Pfeffer did, I'm not quite sure he did that the state can subsidize a church to carry out a secular function.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.274" offset="3385532">By itself, I would say no, not if there's not any opportunity of the charitable patients in any way, the mere availability of the staff, I would say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.234" offset="3425343">But I think you can keep adding until it begins to be a permeation of the curing function with the religious function.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.071" offset="3460660">Now I do want to mention Allen because the briefs in Allen, all the briefs in Allen misstate Allen’s facts and I must say that -- I have to say that that misstatement is based on a misapprehension, I think of Allen’s facts in the Walz opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.741" offset="3555328">I'm referring to the -- it is alleged that the Court in Allen sustained a New York book law even though the affect was to relieve the schools of quote, Walz said, “the enormous aggregate cost for those books”.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.820" offset="3615723">Now actually, the footnote in the Allen case, footnote 6 makes it clear that the parents previously bought the books, not the schools so that there was no relieving of the burden previous, that the school previously had carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.965" offset="3676223">Now there's another point in Allen, factual point that I haven’t seen coming as the one at all and that is this -- that prior to the 1965 amendment in New York, the state didn’t pay for public school children’s books.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.816" offset="3747694">They could be paid for by a special provision, 703 with a local tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.195" offset="3769219">But you see, that means that there, the New York legislature was conferring a benefit namely free books on all children that had not previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.576" offset="3822717">It is quite clear, you'll see that in a footnote in the Allen case at the very beginning in Justice White’s opinion that until 1965, and I'm quoting from the second paragraph, the state purchased books and so and so to rent or sell the books to the public school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.420" offset="3894084">And now therefore, the preamble there that they were doing -- standard for education took on some plausibility and they were supplying to all children something they didn’t have before and indeed, could this Court have said in Allen that the New York statute was unconstitutional unless in the process of giving books to all children, the New York legislature had said but catholic children can't have them?</text>
            <text syncTime="969.992" offset="3984363">Now the analogy in Pennsylvania, you see would be if Pennsylvania in order to fulfill a lack of teaching in mathematics and the physical sciences, etcetera, a lack of teaching had set up somewhere either tutoring or some facilities that teach these four subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.716" offset="4047266">And then you have that kind of situation and then would we come in and say, well the Pennsylvania Act is unconstitutional because it doesn’t exclude catholic children from these facilities but of course nothing like that happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.234" offset="4589359">I want to mention just this about Walz, Walz certainly made one important negative point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.088" offset="4612765">Quite clearly, Walz refused to validate the exemption there on the ground that churches, by good works, by welfare and charitable works, perform a secular function which otherwise were have to be performed with public expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.852" offset="4675772">The Chief Justice clearly renounced, speaking for the Court, clearly renounced that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.550" offset="4698551">That seems to me to pretty well jeopardize the argument of the appellees that the main reason of this is constitutional is because this is a secular function and that the fact is being performed by a church makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.000" offset="4756438">The other important thing is the concept in Walz -- both interdependence and entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.198" offset="4785173">I think they are somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.260" offset="4797398">Here in the interdependence, is on the face of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.635" offset="4810982">The legislature has said, we are now dependent on the church school system to carry out our mandated constitutional duty of educating children and in the brief filed here, the church has now said, we are dependent upon the state subsidy to carry out our church mandated function of educating adherence to our faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.415" offset="4898022">As to entanglement, and I think the very core of Walz was entanglement because it seems quite clear that that it was the concern of the Court that taxation would mean more entanglement than exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.850" offset="4955805">As to entanglement, this Act has a great deal of it, far more than I think any of the other legislation involved in this series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.045" offset="4988615">Not only these inspections and these teacher gradings and all of those new rules but very, very important, section III (III) of the Act 109 forbids, “any subject matter expressing religious teaching or the morals or forms of worship of any sect,” to enter into the teaching of these subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.576" offset="5082655">Now does this not require the state to conduct a very continuing surveillance to use the Chief Justice’s words which the Chief Justice said was the very hallmark of entanglement, impermissible entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.128" offset="5136886">Now, we don't charger there's going to be a wholesale evasion of this by let's say the catholic schools but we do say that it's only an arch secularist who would insist on the immutable secularity of any subject, particularly something like physical science.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.565" offset="5206685">I mean after all it was astronomy and not theology that got Galileo in trouble, and the physical science is all upfront, it seems to me with the temptation and likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.546" offset="5246600">In fact, I think that we could prove if we had discovered that a cleric should not and ought not to teach astronomy without making it God-oriented in a religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.504" offset="5294456">Now, I think the state has got to therefore police this, and I don’t think that any gumshoe from the department of education should be lurking around to see if Sister Mary is using the Bible in French to teach the French language instead of Voltaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.624" offset="5362897">I think it's unconstitutional, I guess the worst kind of entanglement with vengeance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.843" offset="5923798">Nobody ever suggested there were any children in Pennsylvania than not being instructed in these subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.427" offset="5946055">If that had been the search, the committee would have explored presumably for alternative means of teaching these subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.581" offset="5974685">What they explored was all of the ordinate means of giving aid to the parochial schools from shared time and all the way through to this device which they finally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.817" offset="6019615">It means, it seems to me there’s only one question and that’s whether or not the supposed exigencies, economic exigencies of the subject, the overwhelming sociological considerations are such as to persuade this Court to assure strict construction in submission to what is said to be the practical realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.249" offset="6097356">And you're asked to do this by the way without a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.683" offset="6111148">Now there's been a contention of fact made here and that is that if the aid isn’t forthcoming, this school system will wither and die.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.186" offset="6137166">I don’t think it's relevant, if it is relevant, it must be pleaded, it must be proved and I'm entitled certainly to extensive discovery on the question because here the appellees in effect are asking this Court to take judicial notice of a point of economics and sociology about their school system which by the way the known statistical data is on which it's quite equivalent with this point, you know we’re having a decline in all schools at that level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.243" offset="6373418">In my view, Your Honor, it doesn’t bear at all and there's no doctrine that says that if something is more expensive, to be done constitutionally, that’s a grounds for doing it unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.148" offset="6416990">But we cannot be unaware Your Honor with a massive amicus briefs that this issue has certainly upturned itself very much into this case then is raised by the appellees in the brief in this Court and it's there and they say it's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.816" offset="6475609">I'm skeptical as to agree that it's there and I’d like to have discovery on the question before a vast principle of constitutional law is asked to be decided by this Court on the supposition that there is this kind of practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.332" offset="6525764">And to speak very candidly, raised by a church where the figures would show that the capital of assets of the church vastly exceed that of every other denomination in the United States combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.415" offset="6578009">And I don’t, for one believe that because of financial difficulty that the Catholic Church is going to give up a mandated function for which they fought and indeed in Philadelphia in 1941 died for the principle in the condition of affluence in which everyone in society now finds themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.667" offset="6651047">Now, I must get on if I may that the Fourteenth Amendment point, there the Court said no standing, in any of my plaintiffs, the charge was that the non-public schools or de facto racially segregated rather by reason of policy or tradition or practice or cost or residential pattern that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.976" offset="6728265">But basically it's a White school system, the figures that are available from public sources are in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.469" offset="6750312">Again we have no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.565" offset="6762642">The idea is this, that with this amount of tax money going to these schools, they are sufficiently quasi public so that if they discriminate and segregate that is state action reachable by Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.134" offset="6820948">As for standing, I think it's a case where to find out whether or not Mr. Lemon, who is a Negro parent with Negro children in the public school than who alleges in his complaint a deleterious effect upon his children’s schools by reason of the subsidy to the others, whether he has a sufficient personal stake in the outcome which has been the touchstone of standing in these matters, he is a taxpayer, would be illuminated by discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.119" offset="6932856">I think the two are interchangeable because it may depend indeed on how pervasive the segregation is and how much discrimination there is, and we can't find out any of that without discovery in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.599" offset="6990744">Now I mentioned, -- well one point more on the Fourteenth Amendment point, Mr. Douglas, not so long ago said this in Jones against Mayer said the contrivances with some states have concocted to afford to command of our decision in Brown versus Board of Education are by now legendary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.028" offset="7068484">Now, I for one can't, (Inaudible) how if you validate a purchase of services contracts scheme where in fact, no new educational benefit is being conferred, it's merely a method of channeling funds, how that device is not going to be available to the formerly, they adjure state still resisting Brown v. Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.530" offset="7158554">Maybe that’s possible to cut it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.693" offset="7167122">I for one would think difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.959" offset="7176213">Now I said in the beginning that I thought there were eight tests used by the Court and that this Act violated all of them, just in a sentence, first of all the general flat principle no tax money to churches coming down from the memorial or remonstrants might stay through the language of many, many of these cases and that’s on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.000" offset="7252386">Then the primary purpose, if that’s one and primary effect, primary purpose, it seems clear from legislative history, primary effect, we do need discovery, I think one can discern that there is some primary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.582" offset="7302750">Then the concept of sponsorship which was in McCollum, it was certainly an angle, Mr. justice Brennan distinguished the Zorach v. Clauson situation from the McCollum situation on that basis, it was in Schempp that is the state must not sponsor or even appear to sponsor a religion which is one of the points of Schempp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.731" offset="7399299">Then preference, the fact that this Act manifestly prefers one religion over all others and prefers that very most two or three religions over all others and affirmatively discriminates against those religions too poor, too scattered to even think about running a school system black store front, mission type of churches for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.498" offset="7478397">Then interdependence, and that’s on the face of the Act because the Act says it's dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.105" offset="7500863">Entanglement and that’s shown by Section III (III).</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.884" offset="7755922">However, it is my desire to emphasize to the Court that the commonwealth has filed a brief in this case that I have studied that brief and I can concur fully in those arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.312" offset="7861666">The commonwealth, as Mr. Sawyer has indicated is and has been in deep financial crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.605" offset="7882773">The public schools of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and the coal regions are faced with bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.686" offset="7903148">One out of every four children, close to 600,000 presently attend some 1181 non-public schools in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.884" offset="7935958">In Pittsburgh, our non-public school population is 29% of the total school population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.780" offset="7955498">In Philadelphia, it’s 34%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.668" offset="7967096">The public schools of Pennsylvania could not begin to take on the burden of any substantial non–public school population.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.202" offset="8173255">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.195" offset="8189137">I'm speaking here today for seven Catholic, Protestant and Jewish name dependent schools who are the appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.332" offset="8237725">I think Mr. Chief Justice, I should begin by trying to clear up a point which hangs over the case at this moment, a preliminary point which relates to the question of whether the Court below improperly denied discovery and trial to the appellants and it is our contention that what the appellants have brought to this Court today Your Honors is an attack limited to the facial constitutionality of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.501" offset="8378368">Their complaint resided that they attacked the Act both on its face and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.342" offset="8401774">Let me come to the apply constitutionality point for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.574" offset="8426642">Their complaint in paragraph 7 says that they attack, they sue these seven schools as representative of all sectarian educational institutions in the commonwealth, defendant class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.733" offset="8495292">We then brought a motion under rule 23(c) to test this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.926" offset="8532072">We wanted in other words to afford Due Process for the seven schools which have a great deal of variation among themselves for all the remaining 1174 schools in the commonwealth which are under contract and finally even to the plaintiffs so that they would have an opportunity to come in and prove classes and subclasses and whether one or more or any of these schools belonged to any of this particular classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.803" offset="8643563">Now the plaintiffs at this point withdrew their class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.848" offset="8663834">They filed an answer which is contained in the appendix at A42, plaintiff agrees that the action will not be maintained as a class action under Rule 23(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.354" offset="8709810">This was followed promptly by the pre-trial order of the lower Court which said, the action shall not be maintained as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.420" offset="8742097">Therefore, the issue of representativeness of these schools went out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.439" offset="8762159">This was the first wing of their application attack, coming to their second wing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.831" offset="8783684">Did they attack the seven schools, the application of the Act as applied to just the seven?</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.953" offset="8816180">The lower Court asked that all parties submit a memorandum on the propriety of convening a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.242" offset="8865395">Did the plaintiffs want a three-judge court or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.200" offset="8877202">They insisted upon a three-judge court and in their memorandum, thinking now of whether they attack the application of this Act to these seven schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.752" offset="8915446">In their memorandum on the propriety of a three-judge court, A60 in the appendix, they said, certainly it would be a strange misreading of the complaint to in any way construe it as limited to a particular grant, to a particular school or class of schools or to anything less than an attack on the entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.327" offset="8993708">And my friend here on oral argument nailed this down, if it weren’t nailed down sufficiently, by saying A65 in the record, I am not saying and I think I have made this clear that this Act is only unconstitutional as to these defendant schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.909" offset="9060059">I am talking about it being unconstitutional in its entire purpose, thrust in effect, in 67 counties of the state of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.623" offset="9094855">I think therefore, we have to face the question of what is left in this case, plainly an attack on the facial constitutionality of the Act and in that event, what would be uncovered by the discovery and trial which the plaintiff so eagerly seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.928" offset="9164131">Well, let’s ask, that tax money is involved, it's on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.376" offset="9185865">The Act calls for the expenditure of tax funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.666" offset="9203106">The payments are made to sectarian institutions, the Act calls for payments to be made to sectarian institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.606" offset="9234871">The Act defines a non-public school, the payee in this Act, a non-public school as any school in which the requirements of the compulsory attendance law may be met or any school plainly include sectarian schools, that sectarian schools have sectarian purposes, would this be brought out upon discovery and trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.786" offset="9315537">This Court is taking judicial notice of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.144" offset="9324941">This Court stated in Board of Education versus Allen that parochial religious sectarian schools, church related schools serve two goals, secular and sectarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.701" offset="9371230">Therefore there would be nothing to be discovered upon trial with respect to that or that a high percentage of the non-public schools in Pennsylvania are under Catholic auspices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.476" offset="9418250">Indeed the Court must be deemed to have known that in Allen, this indeed is a fact of which this Court can take judicial notice, that seven schools blend sectarian and secular instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.182" offset="9469137">Well, if they do and they may, but if they do, this is in violation of plain terms of the Act is contained in section III, subsection III which provides that in the teaching rendered, if the school is to be paid, there shall not be included any religious teaching or the morals of forms or worship of any sect and I will come back to that provision of the Act in a moment, Your Honors because it's one that I would like to discuss under a discussion of the Act itself, in terms of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.086" offset="9612706">Now, only this Court can say whether the lower Court was right or wrong and its estimation of whether this Act stands up on the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.517" offset="9654502">But if the lower Court believed that this Act was constitutional under the Establishment Clause, certainly the lower Court was not merely within propriety but mandated to grant our emotion under Rule 12 (b) 6 rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.106" offset="9720853">And this was with complete propriety and with complete Due Process to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.006" offset="9748438">It's perfectly evident this case has been down here for a long time, as perfectly evident it seems to us that this case is ripe, if not overripe for a decision by this Court as to the facial constitutionality of this Act under the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.893" offset="9815939">And I would like now to come to the terms of the Act itself because I think with all due respect to Mr. Sawyer that he and I have read different Acts 109.</text>

            <text syncTime="3897.229" offset="15693281">Mr. Chief Justice, members of this honorable Court, if it please the Court, I will open and present the case numbered 570 and will be followed by Mr. Williams who will present 569.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.420" offset="15786068">I expect to take approximately 15 minutes in presenting 570.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.452" offset="15810205">Now Your Honors please, this matter numbered 570 is before you on appeal from a three-judge District Court in Rhode Island declaring one of the public laws of 1969 which is commonly referred to as the Salary Supplement Act on the grounds that if violates the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, by reason of the entanglement that is inherent in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.244" offset="15941339">The case comes before this Court with rather a substantial record, there is substantial documentary evidence, depositions and there was oral testimony below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.195" offset="15997137">I would like for just a moment to analyze the Act which is very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.918" offset="16020020">Section I of the Act sets forth the legislative findings and in essence it sets forth much of the crisis, which you have heard testimony about this morning involving these other cases that have been before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.509" offset="16078430">Particularizing in Rhode Island, the non-public schools are facing a crisis at the elementary school level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.092" offset="16112807">At this level, 45,000 or 25% of these children are educated in non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.348" offset="16149797">The crisis arises by reason of the financial difficulties of the schools in their ability to offer a substantial or a competing salary for qualified teachers that are qualified and are teaching in the public schools of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.513" offset="16222417">They pointed out that in 1960, this crisis was recognized by the state on behalf of the cities and towns in which the state of Rhode Island participates not rather heavily in the cost of the education of the public school students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.161" offset="16293052">Section II of the Act pertains to definitions and under the Act, the non-public school is a non-profit school and it is one where the per student cost of education does not equal or exceed the cost per student cost of education for a public school student.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.194" offset="16389183">Now, a non-public school teacher is defined as a teacher in a non-public school and one who teaches only subjects which are required to be taught in the public school and one who teaches only subjects which are required to be taught in the public schools of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.969" offset="16456265">Now those non-public school teachers who become eligible for what we call a salary supplement which is roughly 15% of their salary, must satisfy certain requirements that are set forth in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.481" offset="16526273">That is, number one the teacher must request the supplement. Number two—</text>

            <text syncTime="4116.544" offset="16570577">Now the teacher must also teach secular subjects to the same extent as those subjects are taught in the public schools of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.693" offset="16611119">And that teacher must also use materials that is textbooks and the like which are used in the public schools of the state and in addition to this, the teacher must promise that he will not teach a course in religion so long as he is receiving the salary supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.751" offset="16699413">Now, the regulations that are set forth or the power to make regulations that are given in Section V of the Act, make it very clear that the payment is to be made directly to the teacher and not the schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="4880.618" offset="19626904">I’d like to take just few a moments if I may and say a word about the statutory scheme that is under scrutiny here in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.319" offset="19665669">Rhode Island made the judgment some years ago as did the federal government that it was difficult to get quality teachers for the elementary school grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.581" offset="19706734">And so, it enacted a law granting a subsidy or a bonus to teachers in the elementary public schools of the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.765" offset="19747485">It gave that bonus directly to the teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.028" offset="19760546">Subsequently, in 1960, it escalated that bonus to 30% of the supplement, but it immersed it in other kids of aid that it provided to the cities and towns of the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.907" offset="19816030">It picked up 30% of the cost of elementary school education at the public school level in Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.058" offset="19852601">When this statute was passed in 1969, what the state legislature was doing was simply, including within the penumbra of the general welfare statute applicable to elementary school teachers in the state of Rhode Island, those teachers who were in the nonpublic nonprofit schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.953" offset="19944239">Now there are 98 parochial schools in the state of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.628" offset="19974959">There are about 1000 parochial school teachers, the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.604" offset="20002858">There are about 1076 teachers in non-parochial, nonpublic or independent private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.898" offset="20047997">How many of those teachers are eligible and qualified and how many have been declared eligible and have qualified under this act, only 161.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.921" offset="20184043">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.829" offset="20183939">-- because the Act is so tailored as to exclude those independent schools whose per pupil expenditure exceeds that of the public schools of the State of Rhode Island because indeed, they don’t need that kind of aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.858" offset="20183834">Now, how many of the parochial school teachers are qualified for this kind of aid, 342 the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.323" offset="20185715">Because the balance of them are nuns and nuns don’t qualify under this because the statute requires that the teacher receive the minimum standard applicable to the public schools system before a teacher can qualify for the aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.036" offset="20260530">And the statutes of Rhode Island show us that $4000.00 is the minimum salary paid to a public school teacher in the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.323" offset="20301699">And the record shows us that the nuns who teach in the parochial schools of the State of Rhode Island receive $1800.00 a year if they have a bachelors degree and $1,900.00 a year if they have a master’s degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.197" offset="20357183">So we come down to 161 teachers receiving a supplement of 15% of the salary that’s given to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.475" offset="20394277">What effect did this have?</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.425" offset="20402113">In 1968, the parochial schools of the State of Rhode Island were able to offer, the record shows, $5,000.00 as a starting salary to the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.635" offset="20450910">While the public schools were offering $6,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.751" offset="20467419">By virtue of the salary supplement here it provided for, the parochial school could offer $6000.00 by raising it’s contribution from 5 to 5100 and the state would then contribute $900.00 directly to the teacher under some very sharply defined and circumscribed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.434" offset="20554146">Number one, that the teacher did not teach religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.211" offset="20569192">Number two, that the teacher was certified by the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.578" offset="20586747">Number three, that the teacher used only those materials and textbooks used in the public schools for subjects being taught and required to be taught in the public schools at Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.142" offset="20632931">Number five, that the teacher received a minimum salary provided for in the public schools of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.689" offset="20659158">And number six, that the salary plus the supplement not equal or exceed, not exceed, the maximum average for the public school counterpart teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.191" offset="20725196">That’s what this Act did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.713" offset="20731256">In other words, it provided to certain teachers under carefully circumscribed conditions, a possible parity of income for teaching the same subjects with the same materials, with the same certifications in nonpublic schools, substandard public schools because their per pupil expenditure was below the public school expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.582" offset="20854763">Now, if the court please, what did the lower court say with respect to this Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.902" offset="20896037">Because I submit to the court that statutory scheme here in the State of Rhode Island is no different from a situation where the state would offer $500.00 grant or an $800.00 grant to all the elementary school teachers across the board in nonprofit schools so long as they did not teach religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.655" offset="20994988">I don’t think that kind of statute would be subject successfully to constitutional attack under the test that has been laid down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.099" offset="21024768">That’s precisely what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.866" offset="21031873">What do the Lower Court say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.738" offset="21043367">It purported to apply the purpose and primary effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.373" offset="21065937">And what it did say about the purpose, it said the first part of this test determining the statute's purpose presents little difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.560" offset="21098642">The Salary Supplement Act in our opinion was not intended to advance or interfere with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.634" offset="21122884">The statute resides that its purpose is to provide quality education for all Rhode Island youth, those in public and nonpublic schools, the quality of education in the nonpublic schools are legitimate legislative concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.633" offset="21178890">We find nothing in the history and the structure of the Act which suggests that the legislative purpose was other than as declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.647" offset="21210969">It then goes on to say that it’s certainly fulfills a secular purpose for the statute to have been limited to teachers in schools who’s per-pupil expenditure does not equal or exceed the public expenditure because it that way, this aid is directed to teachers who are teaching in substandard economic schools which cannot afford to pay them on a parity for the same services with the public schools in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.105" offset="21332804">Now what does it say about the purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.129" offset="21340954">And this is where we submit the lower court (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.691" offset="21363210">It says this, it says, and this is at page 37 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.653" offset="21391005">“On the one hand, we find the statute will have the secular effect of aiding the quality of secular education in the State of Rhode Island, precisely what it was intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.574" offset="21438652">Precisely what the purpose of a legislature was, it finds that it did have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.107" offset="21460804">But, it goes on to say on the other hand, we think it equally clear that the Act gives significant aid to a religious enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.422" offset="21506048">At page 40, it repeats and it says, the second part of the Schempp test determining the statute's primary effect presents a more difficult problem of definition and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.933" offset="21552128">Plaintiffs have argued that primary mean is essential or fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.186" offset="21565189">Defendants and interveners have taken a more literal position, claiming that primary means first in order of the importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.922" offset="21592043">The problem of definition is critical in this case because we have noted the Act has two significant effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.749" offset="21623390">On the one hand, it aids the quality of secular education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.685" offset="21643139">On the other, it provides support to a religious enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.993" offset="21664350">This Court, since it began the evolution of the purpose and primary test has found in four instances that the mere fact that an effect of a statute may be of aid or benefit to religion does not constitute a barrier to its passing constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.194" offset="21753166">It said it in Everson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.465" offset="21758286">It is said in the McGowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.145" offset="21764974">It said it in Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.454" offset="21770198">And it said in Walz.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.239" offset="21777304">Furthermore, this Court has found that in focusing on the nature of the primary effect, you look at the functions subsidized, not the institution benefiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.059" offset="21832683">It is said this in Everson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.572" offset="21838639">It’s said in McCollum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.955" offset="21844177">It’s said it in Allen and it found both in Pierce against the Society of Sisters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.884" offset="21867896">43 years ago and in Board of Education against Allen, three years ago that these schools do provide a secular function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.225" offset="21909274">Now, what would be the effect, what would be the effect of following the lower court’s concept of the primary effect test?</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.413" offset="21954100">It would be as follows, we would roll back, the law of Church and State 25 years, if we found that because a secular statute that had a secular set gave incidental aid to religion that it failed to pass constitutional muster then we must of necessity reverse Everson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.844" offset="22059739">We must reverse McGowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.889" offset="22067994">We must reverse Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.525" offset="22074472">And we must reverse Walz.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.715" offset="22087220">And if we consider the nature of the word significant, significant aid to a secular enterprise, then we better focus on how significant the aid is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.119" offset="22140824">The aid here, 161 teachers from 98 schools or one-and-a-half teachers per school, receiving $900.00 salary supplement pails into insignificance compared to the significance of the aid in Everson in 1947 when a whole school load of children were bussed to and from school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.274" offset="22257539">Simple arithmetic will tell you that if you are paid ten cents a ride to take 300 little boys and girls to and from school on a 180 school days a years, twice a day, you’re talking about $12,000.00 or $13,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.911" offset="22316053">In Board of Education against Allen, we talked about giving textbooks or lending textbooks to the children of the New York Elementary Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.631" offset="22358894">If they received their textbook in mathematics, if they received their textbook in science, if they received their textbook in a foreign language, then we are talking about a per-pupil expenditure or a per school expenditure that dwarfs the expenditure that is countenance in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.309" offset="22445620">So, I suggest that when the court strikes down the Rhode Island statute as failing to pass the primary test facet of the test fashioned by this Court, because it is giving significant aid to the schools, it is running counter to the whole train of decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5632.448" offset="22634224">Obviously, if the school as the record shows couldn’t afford to pay an extra thousand dollars to get quality lay teachers, it couldn’t afford to escalate the nuns from $1800.00 to $4,000.00 a year, when there were seven or eight nuns teaching in these schools and one or two layman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.803" offset="22703606">So that the nuns, practically, as the record shows, absolutely cannot qualify for this aid, the record does show if the court please, that one nun did and she qualified because her mother was dying, she had to leave the order, she had to go out and earn money to support her mother and live outside of the convent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5779.645" offset="23223024">I think that this was expressed and articulated clearly, perhaps for the first time in Walz against the Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.835" offset="23267746">And the question then becomes, because this is the caveat of Walz as I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.258" offset="23297421">It does not abrogate the purpose and primary effect test at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.266" offset="23313512">It simply adds a caveat to the primary effect test, the purpose and primary effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.422" offset="23334097">And it says if the program, if the statute creates an excessive entanglement between church and religion, then the statute must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.710" offset="23371191">And then the court made a calculated choice between the exemption of the ad valorem tax for churches and the imposition of the ad valorem tax for churches and found that there was a lesser degree of involvement resulting from the exemption than from the imposition looking down the road and apparently shunning the prospect of foreclosing on a church.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.349" offset="23453842">I suggest, if the court please, that the same rationale holds here, because this Court in discussing this problem had this to say, it said “If the quality of teaching,” this is at page 37 of the record, “falls too low, then not only will catholic parents be reluctant to enroll their children, but the parochial school will run afoul of Rhode Island’s education laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.026" offset="23604517">50 years ago, this Court said that parents could satisfy the compulsory school attendance laws of this nation by sending their children to these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.889" offset="23651955">The unspoken corollary of that of course was that the was that the state had the right to regulate the secular facet of these schools and indeed they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.407" offset="23686019">They’ve regulated the number of days to which children must go, they’ve picked the holidays, they’ve required certification of the teachers and they indeed have insisted that certain subjects be thought, Rhode Island has done the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.633" offset="23746936">Now I say, if the Court please, that if the state can compel then, it may assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.975" offset="23784344">And that’s what its doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.862" offset="23791867">I say that the degree of involvement between the operation of these schools and the compulsory school attendance laws of Rhode Island and the country in fact, make the degree of involvement of paying $900.00 to a teacher di minimus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.846" offset="23875772">I say also that if the legislative judgement has been made by the State of Rhode Island, that these schools cannot attract and hold qualified teacher for secular subjects, without those teachers being given a subsidy, then, the quality of secular education in those schools is going to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.210" offset="23981202">And when it becomes marginal, the ugly confrontation which this Court eschewed in Walz against the Tax Commission becomes a reality, because then, there comes the kind of entanglement, the kind of excessive entanglement that this Court expressed its abhorrence for last year in Walz against the Tax Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="6316.776" offset="25371544">This case, unlike Lemon and unlike Allen does present a record on trial with documentary and live witnesses and I believe that this is a case upon which the court can get at least a realistic glimpse as to what actually is the effect of these statutes because it’s upon the effect of the statutes that the court tells that is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="6513.197" offset="26157202">From Watson against Jones in 1870, to Cantwell against Connecticut when the court said we will not allow a state official to pass or to censor, what is and what is not religious.</text>

            <text syncTime="7482.516" offset="30034505">I want to know if a child is in anyway required to participate in religious instruction or religious practice, or in anyway, his religion is relevant to his enjoyment of that facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="7500.734" offset="30107335">Then, that is not constitutional, this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7505.813" offset="30127606">As a matter of fact, the Court said in Everson, you cannot deprive a person of a public welfare benefit, because of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7515.551" offset="30166580">And if a child cannot enjoy a park, because it's not of right religion or if the child can't enjoy the park or the gymnasium, unless he partakes religious teaching, it's seems to me that’s a violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7529.918" offset="30224050">Now, on the purpose, one word about the purpose, I've said in Tilton, that under the principle of coordinate branches of government, this Court may not, perhaps examine it beyond the stated purpose of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="7559.372" offset="30341914">I do not think that applies to state statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="7581.526" offset="30430521">The actual realities of this situation is that parochial schools are in economic crisis.</text>

            <text syncTime="7594.376" offset="30481930">This I submit is the purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7597.608" offset="30494783">And if, as this case shows, a parochial school system is established and created to maintain the religion of its adherence, then I say that a statue, whose purpose is to relieve that church of its financial responsibility, by taking part, then that’s the purpose that statute, is to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7623.596" offset="30598750">I would like to conclude and leave the balance to my associate, Mr. Stanzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="7631.340" offset="30629784">But I find it necessary to point out the tremendous significance of these two cases before this Court, as to the future of a public educational system in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7647.806" offset="30695612">The public school system, to me one of the most important, it's one of the most important contribution, which our democracy has made to civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="7658.297" offset="30737617">It is the only situation, the only institution, which has an open door policy by law, which no child can be denied entrance, because of child’s color, the child’s wealth or lack of wealth, the child’s religion or lack of religion, it is universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7675.031" offset="30804490">Because it is universal, because every child can come in without questions, the door will never close on a child entering a public school, because of that, that school deserves and merits financial support and maintenance, by taxes levied against all of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="7698.504" offset="30898427">But once an institution can close its doors, and say before you come in, I want to know your face, I want to know your color, I want to know whether you have a correct baptismal certificate, otherwise you don’t come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7712.743" offset="30955374">I say the constitution of the United States does not allow such an institution to be supported by tax raise, and funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="7953.473" offset="31918247">First, I would like to explain how the legislature is implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="7960.389" offset="31945937">The Deputy Commissioner of Education testified and related that he was appointed by the Commissioner of Education to draw up rules and regulations and then subsequently after drawing of the rules and regulations, they were considered at a public hearing, and they were adapted, and the material, the rules and regulations together with the applications forms for the teachers, and together with the NPS number 31 that Mr. Williams referred to, was sent to the non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7989.928" offset="32064115">Thereafter, the non-public schools submitted the accounting forms or the expenditure sheets, and the data contained therein, together with the applications to the Deputy Commissioner of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="8004.244" offset="32121375">And he then, reviewed the forms, some 250 teachers, and approved all of them, all of them coming from the Roman Catholic schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="8023.676" offset="32199116">He must set forth in page 3 of rules and regulations verify Department of Education, upon receipt of an application for a salary supplement, shall determine the applicant’s eligibility by verifying whether or not the applicant complies with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.401" offset="32274035">The expenditure form, which is attached to it, sets forth a summary of all the current expenditures of the school.</text>

            <text syncTime="8087.979" offset="32456265">If the expenditures exceed the per pupil expenditure for the grade in the public schools, then he will go into these schools, and conduct an audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8098.985" offset="32500360">And as he testify, would may give determination, as between the sectarian expenditures and the secular expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="8173.368" offset="32797842">There is a difference as to determining between the -- making a determination as to the sectarian expenditures and the secular expenditures, as required under this Act, as the Commissioner of Education says, he’s going to perform.</text>

            <text syncTime="8247.818" offset="33095638">But that does not have to -- it seems to me in any rate, does not seem to interfere with the religious aspects of the school itself, and with respect to making an investigation as now the Commissioner of Education has put in the role of making an investigation to determine, what is the sectarian or what is not sectarian, and this determination as to whether or not teachers who apply under this Act must qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="8272.171" offset="33193127">To move on Your Honor, I would like to point out the nature of the school itself, the totality of the religious atmosphere that’s involved in the school, this is amply supported by the record and I would suspect it's almost conceded by my brothers, but to point out the guideline, which is Exhibit 14, as the document that has been utilized in evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8295.541" offset="33286541">This handbook is in effect, it has been modified in certain forms, and it is used and is binding upon the administration, the operation of the schools, and each principle, and each of the school maintains his handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="8310.865" offset="33347877">In order to complete the -- to indicate to the Court the religious atmosphere that is maintained, though not in the record though, part of the evidence that as an Exhibit 14a, which supportedly where some modifications of the guidelines of the school system, and this was related by Judge Coffin in his decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="8335.974" offset="33448291">It was letter dated January 20, 1970, which the Court considered a letter from Father Mullin to the elementary school principals, where he pointed out under the question of whether or not, in light of the problems that there were maintained by the schools, with respect of the proportion of lay teachers to religious teachers that Father offered his own opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8358.147" offset="33537003">And this is in his letter to the elementary school principals, that reducing this proportion should not be done, (Inaudible) for lay teachers should be maintained at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="8367.939" offset="33576187">The reasons are: 1) the obvious financial difficulty, and 2) the delusion of the catholic atmosphere of that school, that might result, then of course, the financial considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8380.706" offset="33627178">The schools all have religious and lay teachers, fathers and priest do not teach, but occasionally will teach religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8390.669" offset="33667093">About 98 elementary schools, and the dioceses, one school has all lay teachers, and two or three schools have religious teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8397.549" offset="33694574">90-95% of a non-public elementary schools students are enrolled in the Roman Catholic parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="8404.288" offset="33721532">The diocese averages two religious teachers to one lay teacher, religious teachers are sisters and there are approximately 29,000 students in the elementary schools from grade one to eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="8414.968" offset="33764268">Substantially, all of the children in the schools are of the Roman Catholic faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="8419.182" offset="33781091">A great majority of the 98 schools are all parish schools, which means they are owned and operated by the parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="8424.781" offset="33803557">If the school is not own by a single parish, three are operated by two or three parishes together.</text>
            <text syncTime="8430.026" offset="33824455">There are six schools which are private, but these are operated by a religious community of sisters, who own and operate the schools, and there is one such which is operated by the diocese.</text>
            <text syncTime="8438.993" offset="33860399">A majority the principals are pointed by the Mother Provincial of the order sisters which staff the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="8443.938" offset="33880148">The last two years, Father Mullin has appointed the principal of one of the schools in which there are thirteen.</text>
            <text syncTime="8448.999" offset="33900419">And two cases, the pastor appoints the principal and then one school, which is autonomous, the principal is appointed by the Board of Director of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.094" offset="33928735">There are two school which have lay principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="8458.513" offset="33938453">The religious teachers are appointed by the mother provincial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8461.403" offset="33950051">The recruiting process of the lay teachers starts in the superintendent’s office, and one of his assistants interviews all of the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="8468.316" offset="33977637">They fill out an application, they are interviewed by one of the superintendent’s assistants, and she refers them to the pastor who signs the contract with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8476.618" offset="34010864">It might be pointed out that with respect to the contract, the evidence was clear that as Mr. Pfeffer pointed out, that if a contractual obligation, let's say it was $6,000.00, if the statute was held to unconstitutional, the parish would be obligated to pay the total of the $6,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="8492.079" offset="34072722">Finally, the principal for a particular school will interview the lay teacher after they are refered to the superintendent’s office, and then the pastor and the lay teacher will sign a contract, upon agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="8500.882" offset="34107935">The great majority of lay teachers in the Roman Catholic schools are Roman Catholics, approximately 10-15% are not Roman Catholics.</text>
            <text syncTime="8508.602" offset="34138760">The schools have the usual embellishments of the Roman Catholic school and is testified as brought out when one visits such a school, he knows he is visiting a Roman Catholic parochial school.</text>
            <text syncTime="8518.739" offset="34179302">Each class, day starts with a prayer for each of the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="8521.653" offset="34191005">They are usually -- instead at the beginning of the day, and sometimes at the end of day.</text>
            <text syncTime="8526.597" offset="34210753">There are lay teachers or religious teachers in the home rooms, where these prayers are said, beginning if prayers of a day are supervised, are conducted either by lay teachers or religious teachers, 150 minutes a week of school time is devoted to religious classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8540.167" offset="34265088">This curriculum is setup in the handbook, on a weekly time allotment that comes out each year in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="8545.643" offset="34286926">The religious classes will deal with the study of the various tenets of the Roman Catholic education.</text>
            <text syncTime="8551.786" offset="34311586">Since, the passage of the Act, teachers who have applied for the supplement do not teach religious courses, but prior the lay teacher could if they wanted to, and if they felt competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8561.572" offset="34350665">It would be up to the individual teacher, to determine if she wants to begin each class with a prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8568.118" offset="34376892">One reason for the Salary Supplement Act or I might point out that there are sometimes visiting missionaries, at least once year, and of course, the handbook provides that the vocations programs are conducted once a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8582.639" offset="34434988">There was testimony given by one nun, who did apply and did qualify under the Act, and she was asked what her view was of the role of teachers in parochial school.</text>
            <text syncTime="8593.541" offset="34478561">She said, on page 223 of the joint appendix, “According to the religious thinking of a Catholic today, it is that young adults going into the community, they should hold a Catholic attitude toward different things they meet with and yet this is not totally Catholic, it is a Christian attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="8609.774" offset="34543449">As teachers, we by our example, particularly and our handling of the children try to inculcate in them the same Christian attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="8618.574" offset="34578662">As with religious, we are toned to discipline, and we try to exert discipline with the children, so they will be open to studying and to proper attitude toward their word.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8626.967" offset="34612308">The religious atmosphere that permeates at the school is that of the teacher themselves, though she does not think that this is an overall religious atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="8635.358" offset="34645849">One of the principal functions of the parochial school she said, is to have available former religious training, because otherwise the children would not be reached, except in the catechetical classes after school and if you do not get them at an early age, you would do, if you’ll handled them right from the first grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="8651.928" offset="34712095">Father Geebung (ph) one of the pastors of the parish schools testified, and he testified that pastor entered to the contracts with the teachers under the salary aid, it is understood that it would mean the salary is paid by the parish, would be that much less, some of the burden will be taken off the parish’s shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="8670.761" offset="34787432">It is most fair to say that the financial responsibilities of the parish would be lessened, if the supplement payment were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="8676.905" offset="34811988">The money saved would be used to better school, but it could be spent for parish purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8684.480" offset="34842290">The Father also testified that he would not hire divorced school teachers, nor would hire ex-communicated Catholics from teaching those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="8692.498" offset="34874368">I might go on to point out that there are numerous references in the handbook's Exhibit 14, which relate clearly the religious atmosphere of the school, which relate and show, and supplement and support the findings of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="8707.914" offset="34936017">And I might in conclusion say, that the court below, the record that it found in making new findings, that it did, is amply supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8716.196" offset="34969140">I respectfully suggest and urge the court to affirm the findings of the court below, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="8726.531" offset="35010518">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8728.440" offset="35018146">I’d like to take these few minutes to just correct two impressions that have been left with the Court, in the argument of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="8742.414" offset="35074048">Mr. Pfeffer suggested to the Court that the superintendent of schools, for the parochial schools of Rhode Islands, testified that if the statute were held unconstitutional, then the money would just continue to come from the parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="8763.778" offset="35159521">The record shows first of all, that what the superintendent testified to, was that the contracts with his teaches were signed after the statutes were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8777.809" offset="35215632">And that because the individual schools were bound by those contracts, they would have to pay for that year, the amount of money called for in the contract, because it had been executed, but it did not suggest, he did not suggest, he did not say that thereafter, that the schools would be able to continue this higher stipend.</text>
            <text syncTime="8803.007" offset="35316464">Now, an issue has been injected in the last moments of the arguments here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8807.797" offset="35335586">The suggestion has been made that there are some kind of exclusion policy in these schools, either racial or religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="8815.985" offset="35368291">And I receive the (Inaudible) this morning from Mr. Pfeffer, when he said that I had misstated Title 6 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8827.846" offset="35415730">Well, Title 6 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is specifically incorporated in the Rhode Island Salary Supplement Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8837.485" offset="35454286">It's precisely stated such regulations shall ensure that any non-public school, as that term is defined earlier in this chapter, which employs teachers who receive salary supplements, as provided for in this chapter shall comply with the provisions contained in Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="8858.851" offset="35539759">And the suggestion was made this morning that there was exemption for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8865.930" offset="35568076">Well, there is an exemption for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8868.250" offset="35577375">There's a very narrow circumscribed exemption for religious in Title 42 2008, Section 1, in hiring policies of institutions, where the hiring is by a religious institution, for a religious activity, it is so that a religious school does not have to hire somebody of a different religion to teach religion, which would have no acquisition to this case, because religion teachers are excluded from the benefits of the Act, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="8905.407" offset="35726064">There was no suggestion at any time, until the veining hours of the argument here in this Court that there was ever any exclusion on the basis of race from any of these schools, never at any time in the lower court, and indeed the record is diametrically to the contrary, and I invite the Court to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8926.242" offset="35809343">And I suggest likewise, there has been no evidence produced in this record, in the lower court, that anyone is excluded from these school by virtue of religion for indeed the record once again is diametrically opposite to the suggestion that was made in the closing moments of counsel's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="8975.127" offset="36004948">And it was pointed out that many sections of the handbook were superseded or never operative and that were never put into practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8985.723" offset="36047266">And the counsel met and stipulated with respect to certain portions of the handbook and that whole dialog is contained between 120 and 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="8995.644" offset="36086972">And I suggest to the Court that there never was an issue in this case, there never was an issue to which this particular section could be germane, because there was no proof of exclusion on a racial or religious grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="9009.176" offset="36141098">For these reasons, we ask that this Court uphold the constitutionality of the Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act, as applied to the teachers in the nonprofit, nonpublic schools.</text>
