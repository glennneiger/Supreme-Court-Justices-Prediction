            <text syncTime="35.861" offset="246784">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.800" offset="258591">I'm representing a woman who was ousted from her job as a school teacher in Orange County, Florida because she refused to take a loyalty oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.284" offset="296521">Incredibly, the oath that was first tendered to -- to the appellant was the duplicate word for word, but the oath that was voided by this Court almost 10 years ago in the Cramp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.142" offset="347930">Indeed both this case and the Cramp case arose in Orange County and individuals comprise in that county's Board of Public Instruction were defendants in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.722" offset="398294">The Court will forgive counsel, he hopes if he confesses to a sense of déjà vu.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.717" offset="422222">The feeling of having been here before is enhanced by the fact that just three years ago, counsel stood at the bar of the Court to plead the Whitehill case on behalf of another teacher who chaffed at the loyalty of.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.562" offset="473631">From Cramp through Whitehill and James versus Gilmore, on seven occasions in the last decade, on relatively narrow grounds, this Court has invalidated all state negative loyalty oaths for public employees to come before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.117" offset="539878">The affirmative or positive oaths have been left standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.652" offset="557955">Now, we've come full circle, for we are back again to consider the oath and law that was reviewed by the Court in Cramp, the first case in this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.124" offset="603826">As enacted, the Florida loyalty statute contained five operative phrases, test oaths, we submit each separately or all taken together.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.829" offset="646666">In Cramp, this Court declared one of these phrases at least invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.655" offset="669968">In the present case, the Court below struck down two more.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.261" offset="692433">Over Judge Simpson dissent however, it declared severable and then validated the remaining two phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.287" offset="720541">On the surface, one is negative and the other is affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.947" offset="739140">Now, all teachers and all other employees are officials of the State of Florida must now swear an oath in the following form.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.669" offset="778010">“That I will support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida, and that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government to the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence.”</text>

            <text syncTime="224.721" offset="1002245">But you think it is unconstitutional for this Court to require as we did this morning, seven or eight men to take an oath that they will support and defend the Constitution?</text>

          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="236.227" stopTime="411.030">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="236.227" offset="1048325">Your Honor, I'm not here to press the question of whether an Attorney maybe compelled to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.918" offset="1087091">I understand that question maybe before the Court right now in three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.876" offset="1106840">However, I think the case of an Attorney maybe distinguishable, maybe different, really different in the case of a school teacher, a garbage collector, a subway conductor, a -- well, any number of potential public employees of the State of Florida or for that matter of any other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.843" offset="1186774">We are submitting that indiscriminate test oath of all public employees is a test oath, an unconstitutional oath for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.397" offset="1224913">We could also suggest grounds upon which this particular test oath could be voided without the Courts reaching that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.879" offset="1250931">However, we would respectfully submit that it would be appropriate in this case for that question to be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.093" offset="1279770">But taking the case of the Attorney, Mr. Chief Justice, one could suggest that an Attorney coming to the bar to operate within an system of law under a Constitution might well, at very least as a symbolic act of fidelity take an oath support the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.300" offset="1360541">Whether or not such an Attorney would ever be prosecuted for perjury of course is questionable in my mind, but if cause came on subsequent occasion to think that the oath were taking falsely, we're not quite even certain what that mean of course, but we do believe that the case of an Attorney would be somewhat different from that of just an ordinary public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.250" offset="1452387">In fact Your Honor, we make five arguments as to the oaths in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.905" offset="1479032">None of which do turn on particular phrase at issue or whether it is cast in negative or affirmative terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.336" offset="1508707">We propose in this argument to take the high ground and hope to persuade the Court that the time has come at last to address underlying question of whether indiscriminate test oaths, regardless of how they maybe cast, invariably offend the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.033" offset="1579551">Now, we would make five points in this case, two of them address the indiscriminate test oaths or all indiscriminate test oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.644" offset="1617899">The first is that such test oaths violate the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.951" offset="1643186">The second is by operating automatically in an area abutting essential First Amendment Rights, all such test oaths violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in this case or of to federal oath, the Fifth Amendment for lack of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.936" offset="1727091">The other three arguments we would make pertain more specifically to the oaths in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.381" offset="1760946">-- for lack of a hearing, hearing on what and at what stage?</text>

          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="418.050" stopTime="631.602">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="418.050" offset="1775574">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.704" offset="1782157">The hearing might be on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.579" offset="1801697">It's our submission that all test oaths had within them an element to vagueness and over breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.110" offset="1831790">None of them is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.303" offset="1840567">A layman taking the oath and who takes oath seriously might well wonder what the oath means.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.069" offset="1863659">There's no provision in the Florida law nor in most laws for any clarification of the oath and the case before the Court is a particularly interesting one in this regard because as the brief demonstrates and the record demonstrates, this Court had in fact struck down one provision in the oath that was first submitted to our client, to the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.444" offset="1953102">Now it just so happened, the appellant went to an Attorney and was informed that the oath that she was given was in firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.580" offset="1981733">And then the public -- the school board attempted to cure that oath and we got into a litigation posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.216" offset="2020185">In the absence of a hearing opportunity, that clarification in this case would never have occurred or might never have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.481" offset="2053308">In addition, if the oath is it all vague the clarification possibility would never occur, if the person has conscientious reasons to believe that the oath is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.970" offset="2091238">Secondly, a large number of people have conscientious objections to the taking of oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.234" offset="2120286">I'm not merely talking about whether they can swear or affirm, but they conscientiously scruple against taking oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.945" offset="2155186">Members of the Society of Friends for example, might well not wish to take any oath, members of the Seventh Day Adventist sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.373" offset="2180890">for example, might well not wish to take any oath as this Court recognized in Torcaso I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.814" offset="2210670">So, the indiscriminate across the board automatically operating test oath as in this case provides no opportunity for a person who may have a good constitutional exception to the oath, at least in her case or his in case to assert that exception or it provides absolutely no opportunity for that person to explain his or her reasons for not taking the oath and to provide if that's necessary the kind of a record to demonstrate whether in fact they are a risk to the Government in an employment capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.196" offset="2372106">Now, as I suggested, we will make three other arguments and have made them in our brief, addressed to the oaths at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.589" offset="2409723">The first argument will be that it is illuminated by the Florida Supreme Court on remanding the Cramp case, each of the phrases, each of oaths in this case is unconstitutionally broad in derogation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.842" offset="2466774">If not unconstitutionally broad, our second specific argument would be that each again is illuminated or perhaps obfuscated is the proper word by the Florida Supreme Court is unduly vague in violation of the Fourteenth and First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.078" offset="2535633">And finally under the Florida tests of severability, given the gloss put upon the oath by the Florida Supreme Court in Cramp on remand, any surviving provisions of the statute must now fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.010" offset="2587460">Now, if Your Honors will, I'll take up each of the points in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.912" offset="2607000">The first point is that test oaths generally are unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.726" offset="7406320">May It please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.501" offset="7417396">In employing a perspective slightly different from the perspective in which the appellee's brief was cast without abandoning any of the arguments in that brief, in the next few moments I just like to take account of appellant's argument within the somewhat per se context of a three-fold argument if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.525" offset="7505481">The position that the appellees going to advance to the Court this afternoon are briefly stated these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.440" offset="7533171">First, we think that the court below was correct in assuming and we think to that it was on operative assumption that oaths per se, we're not concerned for the moment with the content of the oath, are constitutionally legitimate running as they do, we think and as the Court pointed out through the very pith and marrow of the American experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.026" offset="7619480">Secondly, we think the Court was correct in advancing that assumption to a position that governmental employment as such maybe conditioned upon an oath under certain circumstances and we'll deal again with the content of the oath in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.955" offset="7695235">Secondly, we're going to take the position that the Court was quite correct in upholding after certain judicial excisions, the instant oath which is now before this Court and in the context of that I'd like to deal with the due process arguments advanced by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.834" offset="7754689">And then finally, I'd like to advance the argument that the court below was correct with respect to the doctrine of severalability in holding in effect that the doctrine is alive and is well, and then the case of Jackson and as well as in the Cramp case is alive, well and resident within this very chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.674" offset="7834102">First of all, Your Honors, we're going to be somewhat less categorical than the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.600" offset="7853746">We want to speak to this case before the bar at this point and we will paint with a brush less broad than a comet's tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.765" offset="7890422">We want to take the position, Your Honors as this Court knows, that Article II, Section VII of the Constitution itself prescribes an oath and later, I want to point out that the oath which it does prescribe for the President of the United States is far broader, far vaguer if you will, far less specific than the oath with which were confronted in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.208" offset="7984253">Article VI, Clause II of the Constitution requires that all executive, judicial and legislative officers of the United States and the several States must subscribe to an oath and as we noted in our brief, the first Congress in 1789 precisely prescribed an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.210" offset="8052172">This morning, I stood before this Court and very proudly subscribed to an oath promulgated by this Court and imposed upon me by this Court pursuant to Rule V, an oath which I want to point out to the Court was a tri-part tied oath was far more expensive, if you will, far less specific than the oath attendant to the cause at bar at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.729" offset="8150288">In the case of Bond v. Floyd, this Court held very categorically it seem to me if somewhat off handedly, “A legislator of course can be required to swear to support the Constitution of the United States as a condition of holding office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.907" offset="8214967">We do not quarrel with the State's contention that the oath provisions of the United States in Georgia Constitutions do not violate the First Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.264" offset="8248404">And then finally, at page 247 of lawyers edition in Bond v. Floyd, “Of course a State may constitutionally require a note to support the Constitution from its legislators,” and then, as Mr. Rosen pointed out in the Hosack case, in the Knight case, and the Olson case affirmed by this Court, the so-called affirmative mode of the loyalty oath was exacted, it was sustained and this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.447" offset="8353207">In Gilmore versus James, which was a case that had to do precisely with organizational membership and that particular oath or affidavit was struck down, nevertheless, the Court pointed out that the affirmative mode of an oath as such was hardly repugnant to the Constitution because the Constitution requires one in one place and prescribes it in another place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.382" offset="8444949">And then lastly, in the case of Stewart versus Washington which again, is not on point because it dealt with subscription to Title V of the US Code was a far more involved case than the one at bar, nevertheless in dicta, Stewart versus Washington the, Court pointed out that the oath in the affirmative mode was part and parcel of our Constitution and our constitutional experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.585" offset="8537736">I suggest to the Court that the oath per se is constitutionally legitimate on at least two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.348" offset="8572740">Number one, the Constitution of the United States in two articles, admits of an oath and prescribes an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.651" offset="8601997">And then secondly, this Court has held and I would cite the Court to the Mitchell case and I would cite the Court as well to Ex Parte Curtis that governmental employment maybe conditioned and maybe conditioned in such a way that the employee may claim an infringement of his First Amendment Rights, but that the Court itself will then determine not whether there has been an infringement because in the Mitchell case upholding the Hatch Act, the Court admitted an infringement of several provisions of the Constitution and rights derivative there from, but it will decide rather the permissibility or impermissibility of the extent of this alleged infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.641" offset="9077948">It was a delinquency in this case Your Honor and the Court moved very quickly to remedy that delinquency and to point out as did the Board of Public Education in Orange County after it was notified by counsel from Mrs. Kennel that that portion of the oath which this Court had dealt with in the Cramp case had no proper place being submitted to Mrs. Kennel and she was under no legal obligation to subscribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.326" offset="9620668">I am following the argument of this Court's statement in Bond, in the three cases which it affirmed and with respect to the oath, I took with respect to the two prescribe oaths that Government employment maybe conditioned upon the exaction of an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.434" offset="9681063">And I might point out to the Court right now that I am persuative that the State of Florida and then the other state could exact from a doctor who becomes an employee of the State and who takes the position as an employee in one of the State Hospitals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.891" offset="14274957">As I recall he said, “the Government, any Government, and I assume he meant a totalitarian one juridically as well as our Government has the right to protect itself against revolution and any person oppressed by that Government who does not have available to him constitutional means of altering that Government has a moral right to do what he can to alter it.”</text>
