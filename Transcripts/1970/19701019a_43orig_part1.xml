            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- in the first case on today's calendar, number 43 original, Oregon against Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.269" offset="192449">Mr. Johnson you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="26.593" offset="209795">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.317" offset="220662">This is an original action, under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, 28 U.S.C., Section 1251 in which the State of Oregon is the plaintiff, the defendant is the Attorney General of the United States, John Mitchell who is not a resident of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.192" offset="308120">We are seeking a decree that Title III of the Voting Rights Act of 1970 is unconstitutional and enjoining defendant from enforcing this Title with respect to the plaintiff's state.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.685" offset="370082">The guts of that statute is simply in Section 302 which prohibit states from denying the Franchise to any person over the age of 18 who is otherwise qualified to vote.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="81.168" stopTime="87.940">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="81.168" offset="428074">Residential and the recent case of that provision do not involve in the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_johnson" startTime="87.940" stopTime="886.611">
            <label>Mr. Lee Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="87.940" offset="455137">We are not challenging that, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.010" offset="471437">The Oregon Constitution like that of 46 other states restricts the Franchise to those who are 21 years and older.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.695" offset="510203">I might add that in May 1970, the voters of Oregon overwhelmingly defeated a Constitutional Amendment which would have reduced the voting age to 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.359" offset="564851">There are some points, in the plaintiff's argument over which I think there is a little dispute and which I would like to dispose off at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.123" offset="607901">First that states have traditionally determined voter qualifications and that tradition was contemplated by the drafters of the Constitution in Article I, Section 2, dealing with the election of representatives and Article II, Section 1, dealing with the selection of Presidential electors, and was reaffirmed even after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was reaffirmed in the Seventeenth Amendment which deals with the election of Senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.105" offset="719809">Secondly, states certainly have a vital and legitimate interest in restricting the Franchise to responsible persons, and age is certainly a relevant criteria in determining the qualifications for voter responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.777" offset="798490">Thirdly, the implementation of an age classification inevitably leads to line drawing and reasonable men can certainly differ as to the precise location of that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.922" offset="859094">I think also, there are obviously outer limits, over which reasonable men would also not differ that the line was not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.101" offset="907786">Fourthly, while legislative wisdom may prefer one line over another, no one can seriously argue that a minimum age of 18 or 19, or 20, or 21 is irrational, irrelevant or invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.225" offset="996289">I think this Court could perceive a reasonable basis for any one of these choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.132" offset="1023875">I think the -- the point was put very succinctly by Professor Herbert Wexler in a letter to the President which appears in the congressional record on this legislation, in which he stated and I quote, “Age is obviously not irrelevant to qualifications and since any age criterion involves the drawing of an arbitrary line, fixing the age at 21, most certainly this is not capricious.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.005" offset="1147382">I think that there will be considerable dispute over many issues that will follow in my argument and the Solicitor General will raise, but I think really the issue in this case boils down to one point, and it is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.359" offset="1216763">It's whether Congress has the power to substitute its legislative preference in selecting that line for the preference of the voters of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.597" offset="1265768">Of course, for Congress to exercise such a legislative mandate, it must look to one of the enumerated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.278" offset="1292518">The defendant concedes that the responsibility for determining voter qualifications is at least primarily vested in the states by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.933" offset="1335150">The defendant rests its case on Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.700" offset="1362213">I think in order to understand Section 5, we must first examine Section 1 of that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.464" offset="1397217">And I think the point should be made at Section 1, standing alone is not an affirmative grant of power to Congress, but rather it's merely a prohibition against the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.660" offset="1454059">And this is in contrast to the enumerated powers of Congress such as Interstate Commerce that are enumerated in Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.841" offset="1502751">Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to do all that is necessary and proper to enforce the prohibition of Section 1, but the test necessarily must be whether the power exercised by Congress is appropriate to the enforcement of what is prohibited by Section 1. in Title III, Congress and the defendant have attempted to obviate this test by bootstrap reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.340" offset="1640782">First, in Section 301 of the Act, Congress declares that requiring a citizen to be 21 years of age in order to vote is a violation of the Equal Protection Prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.441" offset="1697102">And therefore, it is necessary and proper to enforce the prohibition by preventing the states from denying the franchise to anyone who is over 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.172" offset="1744018">Secondly, defendant now asserts, the judicial review of Congress' findings is confined to the single issue of whether the Court can perceive any rational basis therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.776" offset="1814444">We concede that the perceive a basis test is the appropriate test of legislation under the necessary and proper clause embodied in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.093" offset="1863764">We also concede that it's a proper role for Congress to seek and identify violations of the Equal Protection Prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.596" offset="1901798">But there is still one defective link in defendant's chain of reasoning which destroys the connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.237" offset="1940355">We submit that first, that the perceive a basis test is not the appropriate test for judicial review in determining the scope and the meaning of the Equal Protection Prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.196" offset="1996152">This is a determination that must be made by this Court, exercising its independent judgment and review.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.505" offset="2041396">Secondly, even if the perceive a basis test is applicable, there is no ground in this case for perceiving a basis that Title III is aimed at a Fourteenth Amendment objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.598" offset="2105762">Now, the defendant relies on a single case, Katzenbach versus Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.059" offset="2131571">I am sure the Court is familiar with the case, but to briefly reiterate the facts, there Congress enactment had prohibited the states from denying the vote on account of illiteracy to any person of Puerto Rican ancestry who had attended six years in an American school.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.093" offset="2207744">The difficult problem in the case was the literacy tests on their face, certainly are not invidious or irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.428" offset="2249122">Nevertheless, the Court and we believe correctly upheld the Act, because it and I quote, “Maybe readily seen as plainly adapted to further the aims of Equal Protection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="551.141" offset="2307950">The Court in its majority opinion followed two rationales in reaching this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.697" offset="2334177">First, that the enhanced political power would or maybe helpful in gaining non-discriminatory governmental services for Puerto Ricans, and for that reason the Court could perceive a basis that the legislation was necessary and proper to ensure Equal Protection of the laws for this particular ethnic minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.425" offset="2429053">Secondly, the Court could perceive a basis for Congress ascertaining that the New York Literacy test was being used as a direct device to deny the Franchise to Puerto Ricans, solely because of their national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.670" offset="2502092">Under both rationales, the Court, and again we believe rightly, defined Congress' powers to determine what is necessary and proper in the broadest terms and confined its review to whether it could perceive a basis for the congressional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.962" offset="2587251">But contrary to the defendant's argument, the Court merely confirmed what was obvious in that case, that the object of the legislation was plainly adopted to furthering the aims of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.178" offset="2648064">As the Court itself said or recognized the practical, the sole practical effect of that Act in Katzenbach versus Morgan was to extend the franchise to large segments of the minority group which had heretofore been denied the right largely as a result of their national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.931" offset="2739075">And of course State action denying rights to the minorities because of their race, color, national origin are classic Fourteenth Amendment objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.815" offset="2790588">But contrary to defendant's argument, there is no suggestion in Katzenbach versus Morgan that the Court was saying that Congress had not only brought powers to fashion remedies, but that Congress could indeed determine what is prohibited by Sections 1, in other words, what is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause and that that determination by Congress would be binding upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.905" offset="2906990">Defendant's interpretation can only be supported by taking isolated sentences from the opinion and reading those sentences totally out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.212" offset="2952234">Furthermore, there is no support in the precedence for defendant's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.620" offset="2973863">Defendant cites two cases involving interstate commerce, but those cases, the issue in those issues was not what is interstate commerce, but rather what is Congress' powers under the necessary and proper clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.497" offset="3041364">In all of those cases the Court still reserved to itself the ultimate determination of the issue of what is Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.061" offset="3087653">I'd like to suggest that if we follow defendant's rationale, it would mean that there will be hardly an area of State Legislation or State Law which Congress could not preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.707" offset="3142196">Because as this Court has many times recognized, legislatures must make choices and necessarily must make classifications or if you like, we can call them discriminations, but these classifications are inherent in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.545" offset="3221504">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit all classifications and never has, but only those which are irrelevant, invidious, or irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.263" offset="3272391">But if we are going to leave to Congress the prerogative to determine which classifications come within the equal protection, then Congress could declare almost all State legislation, declare the classifications therein as a violation of Equal Protection and thus be within their scope, so that they can preempt the states and render your state legislatures virtually unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.186" offset="3392136">But as a practical matter, the contraction of state power or state jurisdiction under defendant's rationale may not be as significant as the effect of that rationale would have upon the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.661" offset="3474056">In the first place, if we follow defendant's rationale and if Congress can determine what is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, then by equal logic, Congress should be able to determine what is not violating of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.257" offset="3556394">I think the Court in its opinion, in Katzenbach versus Morgan clearly indicates that it was not buying the defendant's argument, because in Footnote 10, the Court indicates that, no, it is reserving to itself, to its independent judgment what is violative and what is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_johnson" startTime="1001.188" stopTime="1350.535">
            <label>Mr. Lee Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="1001.188" offset="4108100">I think it is possible to make them severable, although the Act is not contained in severability clause, and I think if we do make them severable, the Court should maybe consider the very definite administrative difficulty that this would probably create, and maybe it would be better to refer it back to Congress because if the states are put in a position, they have to grant this Franchise to eighteen-year-olds in Federal elections, but not in State elections, this creates a tremendous administrative burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.999" offset="4239339">So it seems to me there would be a real question of whether Congress actually intended that the statute to be severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.987" offset="4279359">The second point I would like to make is that if Congress is to be the interpretor of the Fourteenth Amendment, then it likewise would have to be the interpretor of other sections of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.977" offset="4339231">For example, Congress could not only determine what was necessary and proper, but could determine what in fact is Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.400" offset="4376952">Congress could reserve for itself to determine what is in fact a constitutional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.622" offset="4401821">I point you to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution which says that “Congress shall have the power to make all the laws which will be necessary and proper and all other powers vested by this Constitution and the Government of the United States or any department or officer thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.167" offset="4488025">Under defendant's rationale, Congress could determine itself the limits of the power conferred upon itself, the limits of the power conferred upon the President, the limits of the power conferred upon this Court, and the limits of the powers of the Federal Government as against the State subject only to the test of whether this Court could perceive a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.665" offset="4582066">It seems to me that if we follow defendant's rationale, we're doing nothing less than repudiating the doctrine of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.721" offset="4618219">We submit that Katzenbach versus Morgan does not go that far, but merely holds that Congress has broad powers to fashion remedies to enforce the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.998" offset="4679346">In the instant case, there is no equal protection objective that can be identified, unlike Katzenbach versus Morgan which enfranchised a minority ethnic group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.778" offset="4742457">The sole effect, the sole practical effect of Title III will be to enfranchise any person who is between the age of 18 and 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.712" offset="4782268">There is no suggestion on the congressional debate and indeed there could be none that this will enfranchise a group which had heretofore been discriminated against because of their race, their color, their national origin or economic status or on any other basis that could be classified as invidious, irrelevant, or irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.236" offset="4888325">Now to some, including myself personally, it would be desirable to extend the franchise, but legislative desirability is not the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.798" offset="4938585">The issue which this Court must decide and cannot cede to Congress to decide, is whether restricting the franchise to those who are 21 is so inherently unreasonable to be irrational or irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.427" offset="5013086">We submit that 21 years of age, the 21 years of age standard employed by Oregon, 46 other states, indeed which is infirmed in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment which deals with re-apportionment, the only place in the United States Constitution where the 21-year standard is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.170" offset="5096051">But this is certainly an affirmance of what has gone for many years, that the 21-year age standard is a reasonable classification even if it might not be a desirable classification, it is a reasonable classification, the ball is far short of the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.324" offset="5180688">We feel that the government advances the argument that there must be a compelling state interest and advances many arguments which are legislative reasons, not constitutional reasons, but legislative reasons for extending the franchise to 18-year olds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.119" offset="5279848">And the suggestion is made by the Government that great deference should be given to Congress because they are better at this line drawing exercise than a Court gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.316" offset="5316629">We suggest, once you accept the proposition that a line has been drawn, there is an area in here to which reasonable men differ as to where that line should be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.524" offset="5369501">But the decision there is not to be made by Congress because the Constitution contemplates that decision as to voter qualifications would be made by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.789" offset="5414536">And still the question must be made, must be the only question is whether the classification that is made by the states meets the Fourteenth Amendment standards of being invidious, irrational or irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.602" offset="5469811">For these reasons we pray that the Court will grant the relief to plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.256" offset="5552358">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.011" offset="5567404">The legal position of Texas is exactly the same as that of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.432" offset="5593109">I want to check insofar as possible to avoid duplicating the able arguments that Attorney General Johnson has made on behalf of Oregon with regards to Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.895" offset="5646921">Last week, reading one of the amicus briefs to which one of the most respected law firms of the United States has lent its name, I came across an argument in support of the statute that seemed to be quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.232" offset="5728319">It was said that even if, it is not a denial of equal protection to deny to vote to those between 18 and 21, that many in that age group think that it is, that this causes a sense of alienation and the Congress has power under Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment to cure this feeling of alienation even if it is the product of only an apparent and not a real denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.192" offset="5844093">That argument seemed to me to highlight the unreality of this entire litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.049" offset="5879620">Were it not for the respect, as always do to the body that sits across the street, I suggest that the proper response to this Court would have been to dismiss out of hand, the attempt to support this legislation on the grounds that the legislation frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.787" offset="5970526">Prior to 1965, I cannot suppose that anyone would have imagined that the Congress of the United States has the power to substitute its preference for that of the state with regard to the age of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.951" offset="6043146">Even under the broadest reading of Katzenbach v. Oregon it is still necessary, and the phrase that John Marshall has picked up there that the acts of Congress be consistent with letter and spirit of the Constitution and I submit that this legislation is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.091" offset="6127783">This legislation flies in the face of the letter of the Constitution, that it does violence to a constitutional tradition that has gone on as long as the country has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.775" offset="6178461">There are many provisions for the Constitution of the United States that are not hastily read, but about which reasonably men readily differ, but I should have thought that the numerical provisions in the Constitution above all, are provisions that have one meaning, a meaning that does not change with passage of time, but when people of the United States in the Fourteenth Amendment referred twice, 21 years of age as being an appropriate age for people to vote, that they meant 21 years of age, they did not mean 18 or some other number, no matter how functionally, similar that number today maybe to what 21 was a century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.849" offset="6386813">It is, I suppose always a temptation to counsel to overstate the importance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.893" offset="6418996">I do not wish to sound like George Pepper argument in Carter v. Carter Coal or like the distinguished Advocate (Inaudible) first income tax case, but I submit as seriously as I can that the issue in this case has nothing to do with whether 18-year-olds vote or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.383" offset="6492871">That's an (Inaudible) is going to come whatever the decision of this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.043" offset="6523591">The issue in this case is more fundamental than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.116" offset="6539786">It is whether the historic concept of this country, a country, a federal union in which the Central Government and the states share powers and responsibilities allocated by a written Constitution, whether that concept is a failure, whether we now must take constitutional shortcuts in order to impose on the states a reform, to a majority of Congress seems desirable, but that 46 states have not yet seen fit to embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.416" offset="6681057">The most rigorous test for state voting qualifications under the Equal Protection Clause is that the states must be able to show a compelling state interest to justify the exclusion of a group from the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.601" offset="6745736">Even measured against that test, it seems in my submission, that Texas and 45 other states come through with flying colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.630" offset="6797876">The distinguished Solicitor General agrees, as I understand his brief, that there is a compelling state interest in seeing to it that the electorate is composed of persons who are well-informed, mature and responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.709" offset="6870183">The question then becomes how you go about implementing this compelling State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.432" offset="6897142">How you identify those persons who are qualified to exercise the privilege or suffrage from those who are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.406" offset="6932982">Now here again I believe, if I understand them correctly, that the Solicitor General does not disagree with our position, that age is an appropriate means for making this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.077" offset="6987630">No one supposes that age is infallible, perhaps, not even very good criterion for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.324" offset="7024619">There is in Courtroom today, a 17-year-old citizen of my State who is better informed, more responsible, more mature than most 18, 21, 43-year olds that I know, yet neither Congress nor the State of Texas are willing to allow him to vote, because neither one of those have any calibers by which we can say, “Yes, this 17-year-old is ready to vote, this 17-year-old is not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.598" offset="7145723">And so, the invariable practice of the American states, a practice that Congress does not undertake to supersede in this legislation, is that we are going to watch the age, we are going to indulge a presumption that when a person reaches a certain age, at that point he possesses in sufficient quantity, these qualities of education, responsibility, maturity that will let him become a part of political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.314" offset="7264632">Perhaps, as a matter of preference, desirability, all the impressive data that was spoken of on the floor of Congress suggest that today, we can safely entrust to those who are 18 of this privilege and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.359" offset="7340805">But Texas and 45 other states have said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.656" offset="7353971">We have said that we would rather wait until a person is 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.290" offset="7372570">We feel that when he reaches that age, that we can be reasonably confident that he has the needed qualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.976" offset="7403290">For Congress to say that we are denying to our citizens the Equal Protection of the laws by doing this, for Congress to say that somehow this determination on the part of Texas is irrational or invidious or unnecessary for state purposes is simply to substitute Congress' determination of this factual question for the determination with the people of Texas have made for themselves, a determination that we think we were amply justified in making for ourselves in the light of this specific twice repeated language of Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.045" offset="8279542">Justice Brennan, I think that everyone who has studied Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment knows that it was a cleverly contrived, compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.971" offset="8331264">It was pretended not only to put a premium on Negro voting of the South and not the North, it was intended also to make sure that aliens in New York, and women in Massachusetts were counted in apportionment of Congress, though they were denied to vote at the time, but I have not understood that there was any history indicating that the choice of the age 21 in that provision was any part of this elaborate political compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.359" offset="8448815">And as I read history, age 21 is there because the draftsman of the Fourteenth Amendment of the states that ratified it, regarded 21 as the appropriate age at which one become a part of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.481" offset="8513285">The Solicitor General has suggested that perhaps the references to 21 in Section 2 maybe regarded as descriptive rather than prescriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.041" offset="8559574">It is a suggestion that we find it difficult it to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.273" offset="8588413">The Section says, and this is not merely describing, it is prescribing, that if you start denying the right to vote to persons who over 21-years of age who otherwise meet the tests we say here, you are going to lose that proportion of your congressional delegation that the number you exclude bears to the whole number of persons over 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.207" offset="8672214">Now that, in my submission is prescriptive language, that it is never been enforced, does not mean that it could not be enforced or that it was not intended to be enforced or that it should not be read today as having legal significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.569" offset="8829680">I would not suggest that the Constitution of the United States is not an instrument but has a capacity for growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.810" offset="8878582">Obviously the power of the Central Government under the Commerce Clause and others is much greater now than it was at an earlier time and anyone who bares the scares of Maryland free words can't be unaware of that, but I do submit, that it is one thing to allow Congress a very great discretion, and considerable free play and decide what regulatory measures are needed in order to foster the economy, to promote commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.016" offset="9027480">But that it would be quite another thing, to give Congress that same kind of a free-hand in regulating the political make-up of the states, and particularly in the relation to the Federal Government, that this is the one area that until now has been left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.529" offset="9117445">We have still been a body politic, a constituent part of the Federal Union, free to govern ourselves at least in terms of determining how we will govern ourselves, though we must of course yield to Federal Legislation and regulatory sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.398" offset="9188916">It is this that the judgment of Texas is endangered by the statute that is now in front of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.472" offset="9245236">The resort to imaginary (Inaudible) is always a risky form of legal reasoning, and I prefer not to use it, and yet as we have suggested in our brief, if this act is constitutional, it is hard to visualize any other act of Congress with regard to voting qualifications that could not be justified as easily, and there are good many things that go beyond the area of voting qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.469" offset="9381282">The Congress might decide where necessary in order to enforce the grants of due process of law and of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.696" offset="9426108">In Texas' view, the reason nobody ever suspected until this past spring that this power isn't Congress under the constitution is because the power under the Constitution is not in Congress, because the internal control that the State has with regard to its own government by the Constitution is specifically left to the states and with regard to our particular issue here, the choice of the age 21 is one that the Constitution of the United States specifically says, Texas may make, and it is for those reasons that Texas prays for a judgment declaring Title III to be unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2393.108" offset="9675839">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.320" offset="9700603">The cases now being argued, numbers 43 and 44 original Oregon and Texas against John N. Mitchell, Attorney General, are being argued first I suppose because they have the lower docket numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.174" offset="9788061">They involve only the question of age, under the 18-year old vote provision in the Voting Right Amendments Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.828" offset="9838634">And I am representing the respondent in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.032" offset="9859532">The two following cases are, United States against Arizona and United States against Idaho, numbers 46 and 47 original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.434" offset="9901119">They also involve the age provision, but in addition two other provisions, one relating to literacy test and the other relating to residency requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.655" offset="9962036">In those cases, I am representing the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.085" offset="9979695">Since we were appearing for the plaintiffs there, our briefs had to be filed before our brief in this case was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.476" offset="10017311">The consequence is that our principal brief has been filed in the Arizona and Idaho case, numbers 46 and 47 original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.629" offset="10061928">After the factual statement in that brief, there is a general discussion on pages 23 to 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.947" offset="10095156">Then it deals with the literacy and residency matters, and finally it deals with voting age at pages 63 to 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.198" offset="10144162">The general portion of that brief are Arizona brief and the final portion relating to age are in effect are opening brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.200" offset="10196198">Then the briefs filed by Oregon and Texas are in effect, they are answering briefs and the brief which we have filed for the defendant in this case is in effect our reply brief on the voting age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.832" offset="10258683">I have taken this time to explain that situation because I think it is a little confusing, if one just picks up the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.622" offset="10297866">The chronology and the sides of the parties in the several cases and the varying issues made this I think inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.676" offset="10338095">There is another preliminary matter which I should lay before the Court before I proceed further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.646" offset="10373935">I appear in these cases for the defendant John N. Mitchell, Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.234" offset="10408312">In the two following cases, I appear for the plaintiff, The United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.277" offset="10432449">The matter about which I speak relates only to the voting age issue which is in all four cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.121" offset="10463901">It does not relate at all to the literacy or residency matters which are involved only in the Arizona and Idaho cases, which will be heard after these cases are completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.212" offset="10528266">The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 1970, originated in the House of Representatives, simply as a proposal to extend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which by its terms expired in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.215" offset="10604231">And to add a provision, making it in effect no longer as invidious as it had been, by extending the abolition of literacy requirements, nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.607" offset="10661804">In the House, provisions with respect to residency were added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.904" offset="10686986">The Bill was passed by the House and went to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.868" offset="10706840">In the Senate, amendments were proposed to provide for 18-year old voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.437" offset="10737142">There was extensive consideration and debate in the Senate as to whether this should be done by act of Congress, whether it could be done by act of Congress or whether it should be done by constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.555" offset="10797641">When it was pending before the Senate, officers of the Department of Justice appeared before the congressional committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.839" offset="10826689">I may say there are three volumes of hearings with respect to this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.065" offset="10863679">One, the house hearings deals only with the literacy and residency, and then there are two volumes of Senate hearings before different sub-committees, in the summer of 1969 and in February 1970 where these matters were extensively considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.143" offset="10951973">Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst appeared before one of the Senate committees and presented the view of the President that the change should be made, but that it should be done by Constitutional Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.265" offset="11008397">This appears at pages 78-80 of the Senate committee hearings for February 17, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.747" offset="11046327">And on March 10, 1970, Assistant Attorney General Rehnquist presented to the same committee a substantial statement against the constitutional validity of making the change by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.487" offset="11109334">This appears beginning at page 233 of the hearings and the Court will of course want to give consideration to these views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.640" offset="11153951">Finally, when the legislation had been passed by Congress as a statutory provision and not a Constitutional Amendment and the President signed it on June 22, 1970, the President made a statement of which I shall read the first two paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.608" offset="11237752">This is the President's statement, “On Wednesday, Congress completed action on a Bill extending and amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and sent it to me for signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.560" offset="11285608">As passed, the Bill contained a "rider" which I believe to be unconstitutional, a provision lowering the voting age to 18 in Federal, State, and local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.716" offset="11338271">Although I strongly favor the 18-year old vote, I believe along with most of the Nation's leading constitutional scholars that Congress has no power to enact it by simple statute, but rather it requires a Constitutional Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.729" offset="11410265">Despite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one provision, I have today signed the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.436" offset="11441089">I have directed the Attorney General to cooperate fully and expediting a swift court test of the constitutionality of the 18-year old provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.424" offset="11485080">There is more on the statement, but that is the relevant portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.837" offset="11506709">The Attorney General is the party defendant in the two cases now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.770" offset="11534503">He signed the complaint for the United States in the two cases which are to follow, the Arizona and the Idaho cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.787" offset="11566477">He has signed the briefs in all four cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.729" offset="11582255">However, because of his relationship to the President, he felt that he should not present the argument in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.434" offset="11617155">So I am here and I and my associates have endeavored to support the statute as vigorously as we are able.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.591" offset="11657697">As I have indicated, these two cases, Oregon and Texas, involved the validity of the voting age provision only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.616" offset="11701791">It's interesting to note I think that Oregon has a literacy provision, but it has not chosen to contest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.785" offset="11738467">Similarly, Texas has residency provisions, but has not chosen to contest them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.704" offset="11770232">Thus, we are dealing here only with the voting age provision which maybe the most difficult of the three provisions to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.904" offset="11830941">The constitutional validity of this act of Congress --</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.114" offset="11847868">Before you launch on that Mr. Solicitor General, is it implicit on what you said so far that you think the voting age provision maybe severable from the rest of the legislation?</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.133" offset="11915891">I don't believe I have made any reference to that one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.722" offset="11938252">I think that there is a severability provision in the original Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.640" offset="11969912">The Act of 1970 is inform an amendment of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.874" offset="11990915">Whether that severability provision which in the amended act will appear only in Title I is applicable to all three Titles or not, is a nice question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.351" offset="12048802">I would suppose that they were severable simply as a matter of my own personal judgment because they are --</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.056" offset="12087568">They are separate ideas, neither one of which is in any particular way dependent upon the existence or non existence of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.972" offset="12123303">I think if you have got, when we come to the residency problems in the cases which follow, we will find that there really are three different ones there and should the Court find that one of those is valid but others aren't, there might be some intricate questions of detail, but I think I would take the position, though it has not been covered in our brief that the statutory provisions are severed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.310" offset="12232600">The legislative history that you related, might thereon -- that United States versus Jackson as you may remember, the Court relied somewhat on the legislative history of the death penalty provision – what they called it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.142" offset="12379930">Was there any -- is there anything in the legislative history that suggests that any attention was given at the time of this last action of the county?</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.510" offset="12417442">I do not think so Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.114" offset="12431862">I will ask my associates to check through and advice me if I am wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.990" offset="12459342">There was just no focus on severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.520" offset="12477419">The constitutional validity of this act of Congress, fixing the voting age at 18 years on a nationwide basis, acting under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and I find, may I please the Court, that last week I constantly referred to Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment and that was wrong, it's still Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.924" offset="12583058">The Constitution of this provision is firmly based I think on a series of fairly recent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.633" offset="12621928">No one of them deals with this issue by itself, but taking together they seem to me to found a very substantial argument that this statute is a valid exercise of the power, expressly given to Congress by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.824" offset="12710640">This can best be shown I think by taking up these cases one-by-one and using them as building blocks to the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.482" offset="12769259">There are roots in the past of course, but the first of the cases I wish to mention now is Lassiter against Northampton County Board of Elections in 360 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.290" offset="12824534">That case upheld in the absence of any acts of Congress, the validity of the Virginia literacy's test as a proper exercise of state power under Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.721" offset="12894229">And in reaching that result, the Court said at Page 51 of 360 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.477" offset="12925262">“The right of suffrage is subject to the imposition of state standards which are not discriminatory and which do not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.961" offset="12999241">Now I suppose that analytically that sentence is a truism, but it does indicate that the Court considers that Congress had constitutional powers under which it could impose restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.964" offset="13063189">It states the proposition for which I stand here and it is I believe completely established by this Court's subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.518" offset="13109478">The next case to which I would call your attention is Carrington against Rash in 380 U.S., decided in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.397" offset="13156916">There the Court had before it, a Texas statute, which provided that a serviceman could vote only in the county where he resided at the time, he entered in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.802" offset="13218565">If he entered in the service from another state, he could never vote in Texas, as long as he was in service, no matter how firmly he had established a residence in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.452" offset="13277184">And the Court held that statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.560" offset="13309576">Now that is simply Section 1, the basic Equal Protection Clause, there was no act of Congress involved, and the important thing to note is that the result would reach under the Equal Protection Clause alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.381" offset="13368926">There was not a trace of racial discrimination in the Carrington case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.417" offset="13393063">There was none of what was referred to in one of the opening arguments as classic Fourteenth Amendment objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.930" offset="13435068">There is no suggestion of a foundation of power in the Thirteen or the Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.930" offset="13463071">It is a voting case, and it arose under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment alone, thus establishing that that clause is of its own force applicable to discriminations in voting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.282" offset="13716459">Now of course the reapportionment cases could also be cited in support of the applicability of the Equal Protection Clause alone to voting, but the next case that I want to refer to in the series I am putting before you is South Carolina against Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.169" offset="13824084">I am doing this in chronological order, because it seems to me that's natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.593" offset="13845713">That case involved the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.622" offset="13869850">The statue drew support from the Thirteenth and the Fifteenth Amendments, and what was important about the case was the scope it gave to the Enforcement Causes of those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.479" offset="13937246">Section 2 of the Thirteenth, and Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, and these are identical with the power to enforce given to Congress by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and under those provisions the Court held that what Congress had provided in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the abolition of literacy test, was a constitutional provision and I point out that this is almost immediately following this Court's decision in the Lassiter case where the Court had held that the mere existence of literacy provision did not violate the Equal Protection Clause provision of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.203" offset="14156152">The significant difference between the situation here and in the Lassiter case is simply that Congress had undertaken to exercise its power under the Enforcement Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.119" offset="14203800">It's quite clear, as I have indicated, that it was not merely the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also of the Fifteenth and residually I think of the Thirteenth, but here is a situation where Congress acting under its power to enforce provisions of the Constitution, made invalid state statutory provisions which had only recently been held to be constitutional under the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.881" offset="14354892">Now a few days later in Harper against the Virginia Board of Elections in 383 US, that case proceeded solely under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.335" offset="14416750">Now the Court held invalid the Poll Tax provisions which had long been enforced in Virginia. Of course, the situation had racial overtones, but it is again a case involving voting where the Court proceeded solely on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.226" offset="14504312">Perhaps the Court could have proceeded under the Fifteenth Amendment, but it did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.166" offset="14528031">Of course, the statute and decision were broader than any matter of merely racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.332" offset="14556662">They barred white voters who had not paid the poll tax, and proceeding simply on a racial basis would not have achieved the result which was achieved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.116" offset="14623848">Now the next in the line of cases is I suppose the one of greatest importance here, but I do want to suggest that Katzenbach against Morgan does not standout all alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.047" offset="14675571">It is part of a stream, a part of a development which has been occurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.084" offset="14731682">It upheld the constitutional validity of Section 4 (e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.605" offset="14773791">That was another instance of action by Congress to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, taken pursuant to the power granted to Congress by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.372" offset="14832828">As the Court will recall, it provided that persons who had received an education in American flag schools where the language was other than English through the sixth grade could not be barred from voting on the ground that they were not literate in the equal -- in the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.384" offset="14940871">There was nothing to indicate, and never had been anything to indicate that the New York Statutory Provision requiring literacy in the English language was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment by itself, but Congress made it invalid by Section 4 (e), exercising it’s enforcing power and this Court upheld the power of Congress to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.141" offset="15067930">The Court proceeded solely under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3843.333" offset="15476694">You can pick out passages as you so often can in legislative history would support one side rather strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.397" offset="15512952">You can pick out other passages which seem to be almost equally strong the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.088" offset="15543672">The legislative history is reviewed in the concurring opinion of Judge McKenin in the Court of Appeals which we have printed in full in the appendix to our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.577" offset="15613680">And Judge McKenin comes to the same conclusion, pointing out, among others things, that after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, Congress went ahead and proposed the Fifteenth Amendment indicating that it did not have the view that the Fourteenth Amendment alone solved the problems in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.474" offset="15725275">It has sometimes been said that Katzenbach against Morgan provides a startling accession to the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.231" offset="15776266">It’s clearly true that the full potentiality of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment was long unappreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.060" offset="15835617">Indeed, Congress did undertake to exercise powers under Section 5, shortly after the amendment was adopted, but the immediately ensuing decisions of this Court were not such as to encourage further experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.168" offset="15904057">Perhaps, it was a sleeping giant, but there it is, and it has been there for more than a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.639" offset="15949928">As a matter of fact, it was not such an innovation, that is the bringing of it to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.405" offset="15996949">The Eighteenth Amendment had a similar enforcement clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.249" offset="16020355">In Katzenbach against Morgan, the Court cited James Everard Breweries against Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.007" offset="16055359">You will recall that the Eighteenth Amendment forbade the use of alcoholic liquor for beverage purposes that this language quoted from the Eighteenth Amendment for beverage purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.158" offset="16127979">In the statute involved in the James Everard Breweries, Congress enacted a statute under it’s power to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, which forbade the use of malt liquors for medicinal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.339" offset="16188688">Now the amendment gave Congress no power over the use of liquor for medicinal purposes, acceptance so far is the power to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.097" offset="16239783">And in the James Everard Breweries case, the Court upheld the constitutional validity, and discussed the scope of the enforcing clause, saying that it was comparable to the powers given to Congress by the Necessary and Proper Clause, which too I think were in a sense a sleeping giant, not until they were utilized by Congress and shall I say, encouraged by the famous language of Chief Justice Marshall with respect to the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, was it fully realized how far Congress could go under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.552" offset="16413550">Similarly, Congress has no explicit power under the Constitution to regulate intrastate commerce, but the Shreveport case found that power in the Necessary and Proper Clause when it is necessary to make Congress’s power over interstate commerce effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.492" offset="16513337">More recent instance of the same exercise of power is found in United States against Derby, and in many decisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.960" offset="16571225">And then more recently in association with South Carolina against Katzenbach, there is the case of Katzenbach against McClung, decided 5 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.410" offset="16625037">Likewise, arising under the commerce clause and upholding the exercise of the power of Congress to provide equal accommodations in local restaurants as an exercise of necessary and proper power to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.211" offset="16724198">One other case here to which I would like to make reference, Williams against Rhodes, decided just 2 years ago, is an election case where the Court proceeded solely under the Equal Protection Clause to strike down provisions of State Voting Laws which it found discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.243" offset="16816358">This decision along with Carrington and Rash are enough it seems to me to answer the suggestion that Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution provides the states with exclusive power in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="4343.180" offset="17476106">I don't really suppose that for our purposes that adds anything to Carrington and Rash.</text>

            <text syncTime="4409.328" offset="17740675">That case involved a statute of the State of Maryland under which residence of federal enclaves in Maryland, in this particular instance, the National Institute of Health, were not allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.276" offset="17816430">There was a good deal of uncertainty in history, and not merely the history of this particular area, but also the whole history of the treatment by this Court and of the government of federally owned property within the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.662" offset="17905977">It was found for example that residence of this enclave got certain benefits, and were subject to certain burdens, on the other hand, they did not pay taxes to the state of the -- did not pay real estate taxes to the State of Maryland, and insofar as they were renters, they did not pay indirectly to the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.755" offset="18006392">On the other hand, they sent their children to Maryland schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.654" offset="18030007">If they wanted to adopt a child, they did it in Maryland Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.798" offset="18042546">If they wanted a divorce, they did it in Maryland Courts, and questions about that had not in recent years been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.532" offset="18085491">Now in Evans and Cornman, like Kramer and like Carrington and Rash, were solely and simply Equal Protection cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.257" offset="18132407">They are cases saying that specialized discrimination with respect to voting are barred by the Equal Protection Clause alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.644" offset="18177964">In Evans and Cornman, I note, was as it appears in the book say, unanimous decision, at least no dissenting votes were stated and so we have two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.414" offset="18252988">One, a series of cases holding that state control of voting rights is subject to the Equal Protection Clause, even though there is no racial or ethnic or religious basis of discrimination, even though it doesn't come within the classic historical foundation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.474" offset="18357269">The leading cases on this are Carrington against Rash, Kramer against the Union Free School District, and Evans and Cornman.</text>

            <text syncTime="4605.552" offset="18525602">South Carolina against Katzenbach, which involves the enforcing clauses of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, and Katzenbach against Morgan on which the Court relied, and I think could only have relied to achieve the result on the Fourteenth Amendment alone, and not on the Fifteenth Amendment Enforcing Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="5729.010" offset="23019395">Yes, I suppose that it might as a practical matter had a deterrent effect from having an age above 21, although it hasn't been enforced as to its other aspects, and whether as a practical or political matter, it could be enforced in that sense by reducing representation in Congress if states went above 21, I don't know, but I don't think that there is anything in Section 2 which has any bearing on ages less than 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="5766.719" offset="23170278">It obviously has some bearing, it's stated age 21, it certainly reflected the understanding of the time that that was the current voting age.</text>

            <text syncTime="6273.360" offset="25196857">I would, seeing the clock to make my points, if I grab the mic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.852" offset="25218800">First, with regard to the question that Justice Harlan and Justice Stewart asked about separability, I believe that Section 205 of the statute provides sufficient answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.312" offset="25264671">It is a Separability Clause, part of the 1970 Legislation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.715" offset="25286196">It appears at sort of funny place, you generally expect to find Separability Clauses at the end of the statute, but this is because Title III was added as a rider in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.114" offset="25319842">It was the final section.</text>
            <text syncTime="6305.950" offset="25327156">As it passed to House, it does speak general to Act, so that the Age Provisions of Title III can be separated from the literacy and durational residency provisions of the other portions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6320.022" offset="25383476">I would not wish my argument to have been understood at all, as suggesting that the Fourteenth Amendment, and specifically Protection Clause Fourteenth Amendment do not reach the question of voting qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.699" offset="25462157">I recognize the force of the historical argument that Justice Harlan has mustered on several occasions, but my own conclusion has been with the whole history of the 39th Congress and various legislation, and constitutional amendments have produced is sufficiently inconclusive, but interpreting those provisions of the Constitution, it is better simply to look at the constitutional language, than to try and discern the intent of of the framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.553" offset="25589635">My recollection is that when Harper v. Board of Elections was argued here, that one of the members of the Court inquired if Virginia could deny the franchise to persons who had red hair, and the answer, Solicitor's position and thing argued was, that the Equal Protection Clause was totally inequitable, the answer was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.442" offset="25681168">Now, I do not envy counsel who was in a position where he had to give that answer, plainly a discrimination that invidious is one that it could be very odd if the Equal Protection Clause didn't reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.817" offset="25734666">And so cases such as evidenced in Cornman in which my friend Solicitor General finds very comfort do not trouble me at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6415.222" offset="25764237">They seem -- may have wholly consistent with position we take here, that voting qualifications may be a matter within the can of the Equal Protection Clause, but this particular qualification that we are defending in this case is not long that either this Court or the Congress can rationally say false or afoul of the the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.958" offset="25871235">The principal burden of my argument in chief, was that to sustain the statute would be to replace a system of Constitutional Federalism, with a system of Congressional Federalism, and I undertook to suggest you that this seems peculiarly inappropriate, with regard to the political arrangements of the states that Congress should be allowed to decide for itself the extent of its power to order the political arrangements in Texas and other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.370" offset="26000802">Many years ago George Brayton wrote an article on the Chicago Law Review, called Empire to the Federal System.</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.277" offset="26028492">And it seems to me that that is one of the highest functions of this Court, but when disputes arise between Congress and the states as to the respect of powers, we can't ask Congress to decide, whether it is safe or out?</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.499" offset="26085334">We come here, because this Court in a tradition of Marbury v. Madison, must make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.535" offset="26117517">I think that it would not be only Constitutional Federalism could be jeopardized by a decision against us here, but we would also run a great risk of replacing Constitutional Liberty with Congressional Liberty, because I have the difficulty that Justice Harlan indicated from the bench, with regard to Footnote 10 in the Morgan opinion, and it is hard to see what Congress might not do if Congress is to be given as broader scope as is argued under Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.250" offset="26268400">It is true as the Solicitor General says that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment is all -- probably as little used, as ineffective a provision as appears in the Constitution, but it is there, and I do not think that constitutional provisions wither away by (Inaudible), or the words that were adopted by the country in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, are less important today, simply because they have not been invoked in other occasions in which they might have been appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.819" offset="26414686">Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
