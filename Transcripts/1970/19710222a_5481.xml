            <label>Mr. Herbert P. Schlanger</label>
            <text syncTime="6.292" offset="128502">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.308" offset="144593">This case comes to you on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review its affirmance of the District Court of Arizona’s dismissal of my petition for writ of habeas corpus for lack of jurisdiction over the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.770" offset="202480">The question presented is whether a District Court lacks the power to inquire into the lawfulness of restraints exercised over a petitioner who is present in its district when the persons responsible for those restraints are elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.444" offset="265174">Stated in other words, can a petitioner be in custody and within the jurisdiction of a District Court but not be in custody within the jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="51.693" offset="310105">After 18 months of litigation, the allegations contained in my petition for writ of habeas corpus remain uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.236" offset="340302">Those are that I enlisted over eight years ago in United States Air Force and in 1965 reenlisted for a period of six years in order to enter the Airman’s Education and Commissioning Program and obtain a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.401" offset="396936">At that time, I was assigned for duty to Arizona State University and enrolled there under the AECP.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.082" offset="423685">I attended the University from January 1966 until June of 1968, ten weeks before my scheduled graduation at which time I was summarily removed purportedly for having demonstrated a lack of officer potential by cutting some classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.039" offset="487528">But in fact, as alleged in my petition, I was removed because of my participation in the formation and leadership of the Arizona State University Civil Rights Board, a group which sought to quiet and adjudicate ethnic and racial grievances arising on campus by working with the University and city officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.978" offset="571329">The removal was unlawful both substantively and that it violated First and Fifth Amendment rights and procedurally and then it violated regulations and due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.102" offset="619813">While attempting to obtain a hearing or reinstatement or administrative remedy, I was reassigned to Moody Air Force Base in Georgia and was relieved of duty as an Officer Trainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.553" offset="673625">I was denied access to the evidence that was used against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.665" offset="690030">I requested but was denied a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.663" offset="702046">I requested but was denied a discharge first, by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and later by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records and by the Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Seamans.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.942" offset="743111">During this entire period of course, I was performing my duties as an enlisted man at Moody Air Force Base and was promoted twice, first to sergeant then to staff sergeant both noncommissioned officer ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.971" offset="795251">In May of 1969, I requested a temporary duty assignment to return to Arizona State University so that I might complete my degree requirements for Bachelors Degree in Mathematics in the summer session since I was only ten weeks away from my degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.529" offset="853452">Since I had apparently satisfied my superiors that I was doing my job in an outstanding manner, I was reassigned to Arizona State.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.050" offset="887620">The orders said that I was to be assigned for 70 duty days and was permitted 15 days leave in conjunction with that temporary duty assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.286" offset="928475">After completion of my schooling in Arizona while I was still Tempe pursuant to those orders, I filed the instant action for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.760" offset="966405">It was immediately dismissed by the Court without issuance of the show cause order and reconsideration was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.764" offset="990438">I then appealed to the Ninth Circuit and returned to Georgia to continue my duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.220" offset="1008201">I requested expeditious action and in December 1969 the Court of Appeals scheduled the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.343" offset="1032756">I argued the case while on leave for Moody and the case was remanded to the District Court for issuance of a show cause order.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.312" offset="1060655">When it became apparent that the District Court would not regain jurisdiction prior to my removal to Georgia, Judge Browning of the Ninth Circuit entered an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.914" offset="1103078">The Air Force immediately terminated my pay and allowances an act which I consider unlawful but which is not of issue at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.107" offset="1227839">Your Honor, the Government’s brief makes this distinction between a permanent assignment and a temporary duty assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.001" offset="1259395">I was -- I felt that having been issued the orders and having left Georgia under those orders, if I went any place except to Arizona State University to enroll in school and attend classes and get my degree that summer I would have been prosecuted as being AWOL.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.927" offset="1327104">There is a difference in that my permanent duty station in the AECP was Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio with duty that was on a State University and under Bootstrap, I was paying my own expenses, my permanent duty station was in Georgia and I was assigned for duty at Arizona State.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.536" offset="1401501">I think the distinction is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.172" offset="1412054">Certainly, the order has existed authorizing my travel to Arizona and attendance of the University.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert P. Schlanger</label>
            <text syncTime="371.505" offset="1589373">That had been on appeal to the Fifth Circuit on an issue of exhaustion of remedies and all the remedies suggested by the Government have since been exhausted and I believe I submitted to the clerk papers from the Fifth Circuit containing an order entering a voluntary dismissal since the question of exhaustion is moot now.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.509" offset="1669413">Furthermore, if indeed this Court upholds the Government’s position concerning jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit and the District Court for Georgia no longer have jurisdiction in the matter since I’ve been removed and reassigned to Iceland.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.581" offset="1729703">If on the other hand, the Court holds for my position contending that the District Court for Arizona does have jurisdiction and it should be properly be remanded to Arizona rather than Georgia since that was the first filed action and that is where the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.941" offset="1799084">The Court of Appeals never reached the question that the District Court reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.696" offset="1814131">The District Court dismissed the action pointing out that there were no respondents restraining me of my liberty within the jurisdiction within the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.983" offset="1855300">The Court of Appeals simply affirmed on the basis of an earlier decision which held that a serviceman on leave voluntary had a place other than duty station is not in custody at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.012" offset="1903470">The Government now brings -- takes up this argument and argues that custody -- you can be in custody since I was concededly in custody on the day I filed and that I can be lawfully in Arizona which I was on the day that I filed but that I was not in custody in Arizona under the meaning of 2241.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.189" offset="2000123">It is my conviction, Your Honors, that this makes an artificial distinction that I am not attacking Col. Baker or Dr. Seamans personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.077" offset="2043695">What I am attacking is the effects of their authority which are -- manifest upon me wherever I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.466" offset="2077236">In this case, they were manifested upon me at a place I had been assigned for duty for the three months prior to my filing of the action that is in Arizona at the place which all of the actions which gave rise to the habeas corpus action occurred that is Arizona State University.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.167" offset="2148080">At which all the witnesses for a hearing if it should ever be held are present except those officers of the Air Force who might be needed to be called and at which any evidence outside of that under the control of the respondents is that is University records, professors records and things like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.256" offset="2236374">I cannot see that there is any bar in the statute and indeed Ahrens v. Clark which Mr. Douglas -- in which Mr. Douglas wrote the opinion -- Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the opinion in 1948 held that it was the presence of the petitioner which was the threshold requirement to filing of the habeas corpus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.509" offset="2317458">In this case, it was the effects of Air Force authority on me in Arizona that I was contesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.112" offset="2343790">It was obviously custody since I was forced to return to Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.054" offset="2943561">The concern with this kind of question seems to me to be more a question of venue as Mr. Justice Blackmun has pointed out than really a question of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.934" offset="4523133">This is an important, though from some points of view a somewhat exotic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.165" offset="4556048">It is important because it involves the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.267" offset="4576423">The importance of which and its proper preservation and utilization cannot be exaggerated, and it is exotic because the present case seems so foreign to the true function of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.802" offset="4642565">It reminds of the course I once took in advance equity from Professor Chaffee where we learn much about bills of interpleader and then we learn more about another bill called a bill in the nature of a Bill of Interpleader but perhaps this case can be better understood if it is thought of as a case involving an application in the nature of habeas corpus rather than habeas corpus itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.041" offset="4771506">We recognize of course that habeas corpus is not limited now as it once was to persons who are actually imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.255" offset="4808391">It has been made available to persons whose liberty is significantly restraint and thus has been held applicable to persons who are denied admission to the country to persons on parole or probation and to service matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.997" offset="4887385">I think I might say please say though that there has never been a serviceman case like this one in the history of the writ or its analogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.396" offset="4940988">It is important to get the facts clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.576" offset="4957706">Sergeant Schlanger was not hijacked or impressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.266" offset="4976410">He was not inducted into the service as he himself alleges in his petition in the District Court, paragraph – page 4 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.113" offset="5019773">He enlisted in the Air Force on December 9, 1965 for a period six years, a period which has not expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.904" offset="5067003">He makes no claim of conscience and does not suggest that he is entitled to discharge under any regulation of the Department of Defense or of the Air Force as is the case for example of the man who seeks discharge on the basis of conscientious objection to participation in war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.324" offset="5156655">There is a specific regulation that provides a procedure that says that such a man is entitled to a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.615" offset="5185808">He does allege a breach of contract but I suggest that it is a distortion of the great writ to say that it can appropriately be used to review the military determinations involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.009" offset="5251427">As a petitioner alleged, he reenlisted in the Air Force for the purpose entering the Airman’s Education and Commissioning Program and he was pursuant of that program assigned to the Arizona State University in a program designed to lead to a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.761" offset="5338467">He entered the University in December 1965 with his tuition paid and received an enhanced Air Force salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.460" offset="5377233">He continued in this program until June 1968 when he was removed from the program by his superior officers for failure to attend classes regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.956" offset="5431150">He was then reassigned to Moody Air Force Base in Georgia where he returned in July 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.848" offset="5466781">It is important to note that if there had been a breach of contract and if that breach of contract was for some reason now unknown sufficient to relieve him of his responsibilities to the Air Force that had occurred by June or July 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.617" offset="5549850">All of the events of which the petitioner complains whatever their effect may be occurred before July 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.007" offset="5595408">The petitioner then returned to Georgia where as far as we know he performed well in the duties which were assigned to him in May 1969 nearly a year after the events of which he complains and in pursuant to his application to the Air Force, he was given an opportunity to return to Arizona State University for the approximately two months needed to complete his work for a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.060" offset="5719646">This was under what is called Operation Bootstrap which is a voluntary program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.429" offset="5745037">He went at his own expense on what is called permissive TDY.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.178" offset="5768129">TDY being Air Force is for Temporary Duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.614" offset="5785788">This means that he was not ordered to go, he was permitted to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.968" offset="5807208">He could have terminated his participation in Operation Bootstrap and returned to his permanent duty station at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.377" offset="8784854">When he was there under the Airman’s training program before 1968, he was there under orders and he was under an obligation to report and they apparently did not like the way he acted and they removed him from that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.458" offset="8849220">He then went back to Georgia and a year later, he came back to Arizona at his expense at his own request on leave to complete his education under a different program Operation Bootstrap.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.482" offset="8937305">Yes, Mr. Justice that is precisely our position, this might have been a different case had habeas corpus been brought in 1968 although I would still say as I suggested to Mr. Justice Stewart that this is not the kind of issue that ought to be under taken to be resolved in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.002" offset="9055378">It’s crucially important that the habeas corpus power be protected and that it remain fully available for its proper purposes but is equally true that the habeas corpus power should not be converted into a means of general review of intra-military decisions as this Court pointed in our Orloff against Willoughby that and I quote, “would be a disruptive force as to affairs peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the military authorities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.827" offset="9190693">In this case, Sergeant Schlanger was admittedly enlisted for a period of six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.006" offset="9219427">That was more than five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.279" offset="9232488">During that period, he has received a college education and nearly all of which was at public expense including his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.253" offset="9268433">Since he filed this petition for habeas corpus, he has been on leave status from December 9, 1969 much of it by order of the United States Court of Appeals until July 8, 1970 when Mr. Justice Black refused to continue his leave that was for a period of nearly seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.666" offset="9366026">Shortly after this Court granted the writ of certiorari, he was again granted various periods of leave and finally, he was granted leave on December 25th until the present time for nearly two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.120" offset="9439901">Thus there have been more than 9 months and nearly 10 months of leave connected with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.747" offset="9466337">Sergeant Schlanger was ordered to Iceland in January and as I have indicated that was deferred at the request to my office until after the hearing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.115" offset="9519835">By great energy and persistence, Sergeant Schlanger has held the Air Force at bay for nearly nineteen months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.318" offset="9552645">It may be that this is not within the legitimate purpose and function of the great writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.432" offset="9589112">Even if it be held that it is not a perquisite to habeas corpus jurisdiction that there would be someone within the district who has custody of the petitioner, it is still our contention that the District Court here properly held that it did not have jurisdiction of this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.169" offset="9672077">Habeas corpus petitions are not avenues to advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.415" offset="9697050">It still remains a constitutional truism that federal courts have jurisdiction only over cases or controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.141" offset="9735920">A case or controversy requires two parties both of whom are properly before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.549" offset="9769566">Here there is only one party before the Court in Arizona and that is Sergeant Schlanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.659" offset="9797987">The Secretary of the Air Force and Colonel Homer Baker are the only persons alleged to be restraining the petitioner of his liberty and neither one is within the District of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.912" offset="9859009">District Courts do not have nationwide jurisdiction in habeas corpus and there are manifest reasons why Congress has never provided that they should have such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.993" offset="9911359">There is the problem of transportation and there is the problem of forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.695" offset="9942183">If there is jurisdiction in Arizona in Sergeant Schlanger’s case, then any serviceman on leave can file a petition for certiorari in any court he chooses by simply going there or perhaps by filing such a petition by mail or through local counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.418" offset="10025044">That seems obviously undesirable and in no senses it required by any legitimate concern to make the great writ available when it is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.660" offset="10078020">There is of course Section 1391 (e) of Title 28 which provides for nationwide service of process on government officers in civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.196" offset="10144162">We would contend first the Section 1391 (e) does not apply to habeas corpus that it was not intended to apply the habeas corpus and need not be found to apply the habeas corpus to keep that writ effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.889" offset="10222947">Even if Section 1391 (e) does apply in habeas corpus it is not applicable here since the cause of action did not arise Arizona and since it appears clearly on the face of the petition that Sergeant Schlanger is not resident in Arizona that is domicile there which is the proper construction of that word in the statute as a number of courts have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.595" offset="10341752">And finally, we would contend that even if there is jurisdiction in Arizona this a case which should be transferred to the Middle District of Georgia or to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.087" offset="10399744">Sergeant Schlanger suggests that the witnesses and the evidence are in Arizona but that simply highlights the fact that this is essentially a breach of contract suit not a habeas corpus matter and as a breach of contract suit, it is very clear that there is no jurisdiction in the District Court in Arizona under this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.625" offset="10513847">Unless this case is brought to a conclusion, it is obvious that there will be endless further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.949" offset="10547179">The court below is correct in holding that the District Court for Arizona does not have jurisdiction and its judgment should affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.723" offset="11186239">But I, the way I understood the Solicitor General’s point was that habeas corpus would not lie at such a time because of the tenuous nature of restraints at that particular point in time and the restraints were only potential to be imposed when I had to return to Georgia and yet in the brief they can see that it was properly filed since I was in custody under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.689" offset="11282160">But I think that that really is clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.833" offset="11290728">I think the more important question is on subject matter jurisdiction which at least I would like to clear up a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.414" offset="11321031">It is claimed that exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction or District Court’s jurisdiction in cases of this nature would dilute the writ -- would distort its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.429" offset="11357080">I would like to point out that in Orloff v. Willoughby which the Government cites in support of this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.148" offset="11379963">The Court said that they would not interfere in military duty assignments and I concur wholeheartedly, I do not think that it is a proper judicial function to determine what assignment a man in the military should be put to work in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.782" offset="11438477">However Your Honor, the Air Force could you use me as whatever they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.800" offset="11458539">They could have kept me as an Aircraft Instrument Repairman if they had commissioned me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.374" offset="11476825">I might have been the only 2nd Lieutenant Aircraft Instrument Repairman in the Air Force but it would have been lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.177" offset="11500126">However, what were discussing here is a status difference between that of an enlisted man and that of a commissioned officer which I was entitled to expect under the program for which I reenlisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.453" offset="11545161">Failing to commission me, I submit entitles to a discharge just an entitled Dr. Nelson in Nelson v. Peckham where the Fourth Circuit ordered him discharge because the Army refused to commission him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.956" offset="11603153">Following this Court’s decision in Orloff, the Congress revised the Doctor’s Draft Act to require commissioning of doctors drafted under its provisions and the Army did to Dr. Nelson what it did to Dr. Orloff and that they just refused to commission him and still held him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.659" offset="11661981">He brought habeas corpus and he won.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.192" offset="11676191">There was another case which I don’t have the site off in California citing Nelson v. Peckham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.743" offset="11698343">It is not unusual to -- it is not unusual to contest status differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.164" offset="11728018">Admittedly, this is the first case I have seen of an enlistment status question but I don’t think as the fact that I enlisted dilutes my claim anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.405" offset="11768978">If the Air Force did in fact unlawfully changed my status then the contract is void and there is absolutely no basis in fact for the custody now being exercised over me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.722" offset="11810252">Your Honors, I submit that habeas corpus is the proper vehicle to challenge a breach and void enlistment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.790" offset="11846510">Going to the jurisdictional issue, it seems to me there is a contradiction in the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.145" offset="11863960">On the one hand, they say that the District Court for Arizona lacks jurisdiction because there is no respondent within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.856" offset="11890813">On the other hand, they maintained that the District Court in Georgia retains jurisdiction even though there is no respondent within the district now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.365" offset="11920802">Colonel Baker, I submit sir, is no longer a proper respondent since he is no longer in any way shape or form controlling or having custody of me.</text>
