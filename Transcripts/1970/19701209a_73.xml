            <text syncTime="216.214" offset="968182">Thereafter, respondent answered the complaint admitting that its receptionist told petitioner she would not be considered because she was woman with pre-school-age children, but denying that they discriminated against her solely on the grounds of her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.922" offset="1043101">Thereafter, respondent moved for summary judgment, which motion the District Court granted based on statistics that 70, approximately 75% of the people hired as assembly trainees were women.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Robinson</label>
            <text syncTime="376.906" offset="1611003">Yes sir, you are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.492" offset="1625318">Petitioner appealed the District Court's decision to the Fifth Circuit which affirmed and rather clearly announced a sex-plus exemption to the Act of which we find here.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.919" offset="1687071">The Court held that a per se violation of the Act can only be based solely on one of the categories of the Act and the petitioner had not been subjected to discrimination on the grounds of sex, because here there was a two pronged qualification, that is she was a woman with pre-school-age children, or in other words sex-plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.863" offset="1786859">Thus the lower courts in judicially engrafted on the Act a further exception based on sex-plus and we submit that this doctrine should be rejected for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.878" offset="1842866">First, it conflicts with the basic purpose of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.246" offset="1860315">The basic purpose of Title VII is to ensure that women, and other protected categories are not excluded or otherwise hindered in their employment opportunities on the the basis of stereotypic assumptions or prejudgments about their desirability as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.624" offset="1933876">Rather the Act requires that an employer consider each person on an individual basis or present a bona fide occupational qualifications defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.871" offset="1982882">This is of course the defense that the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.816" offset="2002631">In this case, the lower courts permitted respondent to exclude petitioner based on an unsupported assumption about differences between the normal relationship of working fathers and working mothers to their pre-school-age children.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.284" offset="2072534">It would seem that these differences are, that the father goes out and works, the mother stays home and takes care of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.612" offset="2105866">This we submit is exactly the kind of stereotypic assumption, that Title VII is intended to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.041" offset="2135542">It is of course true that many women do indeed stay home to take care of the children, on the other hand many don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.494" offset="2169396">The point of the statute is that they should be treated as individuals, rather than as members of a broad category.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.008" offset="2203355">The second reason we submit that the decision below should be reversed is that it conflicts with the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.454" offset="2237210">Section 703 on its face would seem to prohibit the policy of refusing to hire women with pre-school-age children while at the same time hiring men with pre-school-age children, the Act declares that it shall be an unlawful employment practice to fail or refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.437" offset="2361135">The Court of Appeals attempted to avoid this plain language of the Act, by asserting that the Act only prohibits discrimination based solely on one of the categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.487" offset="2413275">However, the Senate by Roll call vote specifically rejected an amendment which would have inserted before each of the enumerations in the Act, the word sole.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.228" offset="2464266">In speaking against that amendment, Senator Case, one of the joint floor managers said that such an addition would completely vitiate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.388" offset="2524975">The sex-plus doctrine enunciated by the courts below in this case, clearly illustrates why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.517" offset="2569488">Restricting the sex-plus doctrine just to the notion of women with pre-school-age children.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.924" offset="2607104">It would exclude, based on a recent study done by the Department of Labor, 4.2 million women currently in the labor force from the protection of the Act, and allow solely on the grounds that they are women with pre-school-age children, their employers to discriminate against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.475" offset="2681292">This would go far toward vitiating the Act, but of course the sex-plus doctrine can easily be extended just as to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.011" offset="2719431">For example, an employer could, under this doctrine, announce a decision to refuse to hire based on sex-plus marital status or sex-plus an age requirement i.e. refuse to hire women who are 26 years of age or over, or refuse to hire women who are over 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.697" offset="2822144">Thirdly, if the Act permits discrimination on the basis of sex-plus, it would also seem to permit discrimination on the basis of race plus, religion plus, or nationality plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.403" offset="2880972">For example, an employer could then refuse to hire Negroes with chunky hair, or on the other hand Negroes with straight hair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.452" offset="9737174">Well, it seems plain to us that what prevented development of the record was the erroneous granting of the summary judgment prematurely, and that a reversal and remand of the case that called for and on that premise, I would like to comment briefly on how some of the respondent's suggestions about development of the record seemed us to bear on the issues to be resolved on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.882" offset="9846888">One suggestion is that, what the receptionist told the petitioner may not have accurately reflected the company's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.560" offset="9885654">Now, that possibility might affect whether an injunction should be granted or what the terms of the injunction should be, but it would not in our view, be a defense to the charge of discrimination against the petitioner herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.479" offset="9953259">Her right to relief under the Act does not depend on whether there has been a pattern or general practice of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.410" offset="9992965">Section 703 of the Act, which is set out in our brief on page 2, on which she relies, specifically forbids discrimination against “any individual” on account of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.327" offset="10068720">And if that probation is to be effective employers must be held responsible of the acts of their agents, who have apparent authority to reject employment applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.238" offset="10120338">Petitioner's only contact was with the receptionist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.236" offset="10136325">There was no other spokesman of company policy for her and the company never undertook to resend the receptionist rejection of her employment application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.721" offset="10186271">So, the practical, sensible way to apply the statute in our view is to look at the situation realistically from the standpoint of the person and upon whom the statute confers the right not to be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.627" offset="10245831">And that is precisely what this Court did in applying a similar right not to be discriminated against, under the Interstate Commerce Act, in Boynton against Virginia, in Volume 364 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.475" offset="10301315">The Court there held, that there is a statutory right to nondiscriminatory service in a bus terminal restaurant, even though the record did not show whether the restaurant was owned or controlled by a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.972" offset="10355231">It was enough that the terminal and the restaurant operated as an integral part of the carrier's transportation service for interstate passengers and in those circumstances the Court said, “an interstate passenger need not inquire into documents of title or contractual arrangements in order to determine whether he has a right to be served without discrimination” and it seems to us that the same general approach should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.418" offset="10477066">Now, respondent's other suggestion that there may in fact, be no disparity in it's treatment of men and women, or that whatever disparity exists maybe justifiable, raise somewhat more complex issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.478" offset="10537253">We recognize that the Act does not prohibit discriminations between parents and non-parents, or between married and single persons so long as those discriminations fall equally on persons of both sexes, and of all races, religions and nationalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.514" offset="10613426">But, the Commission and the Government have contended with some success in the lower courts, that when the burden of a discrimination based on a non-statutory factor, one of these so called neutral factors, such as seniority or educational background, in fact fall substantially more heavily on persons of a particular race or sex, or on etcetera, the discrimination is prohibited unless it is justified by reasons of business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.786" offset="10746546">Now that is the issue to be explored in the case of Griggs against Duke Power Company, Number 124, which will be argued in a few says, and in which we have also filed a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.834" offset="10794715">The Commission has been reluctant however to see their approach and their possible justification extended to discriminations applied directly to the categories of person specified in the Act, such as discriminations between men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.089" offset="10863679">Now, on the other hand the Act itself, in Section 703 (e), which is quoted in our brief, the bona fide occupational provision, expressly authorizes the restriction of certain jobs to persons of a particular religion, sex, or national origin, although, not interestingly to the persons of a particular race in instances where this is reasonably necessary to the the normal operation of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.125" offset="10987917">But, the legislative history indicates that this exception was intended to be a narrow one, confined to the need for employees of a particular nationality religion or sex, to perform a particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.488" offset="11041311">Examples given by the Act sponsors were French Chef for a French restaurant, or male baseball players for a male baseball team and the Commission accordingly has been reluctant to see this exception extended to cases such as the present one, in which it is admitted that women, as well as, men can and do perform the job of assembly training.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.415" offset="12525066">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.635" offset="12541889">Martin Marietta Corporation does not have and has never had any such policy of discrimination as has been suggested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.355" offset="12576789">And this respondent does not concur in the language of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which had been denominated the Sex Plus Doctrine or the coalescence principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.172" offset="12628093">The statement attributed to a receptionist, does not and did not reflect any sort of company policy of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.426" offset="12669053">Rather the record, in this case, shows that the respondent did not practice discrimination against woman or anyone else in its employment practices or procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.983" offset="12715342">This is highlighted by the the documentation in the record which reflects the company's absolute policy of non-discrimination and equal employment opportunities, which is consistent with its particular reputation as an equal employment opportunity and a substantial government contractor, particularly sensitive to the pronouncements of the government in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.071" offset="12815653">We do however, vigorously defend the correctness of the result reached by the District Court and the judgment of the Court of Appeals which affirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.671" offset="12874062">We consider it to be elementary, of course, that a correct decision shouldn't be reversibly because it may have been reached through an avenue of erroneous reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.960" offset="12919202">We would suppose that a court reviewing a correct judgment with an incorrect opinion, might have a duty to enunciate the appropriate reasons for the decision while affirming the judgment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.886" offset="12982941">The facts in this case simply do not justify escalation into a cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.417" offset="13021080">The petitioner and her amici have invited this Court to decide far more than is necessary for an appropriate disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.108" offset="13067786">There is but a single issue and the resolution of which can appropriately determine the question of affirmance or reversal and of the judgment of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.992" offset="13123375">That question is of course, very simply and obviously whether the District Court's order for summary judgment in favor of the respondent was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.720" offset="13170291">And the sanction of course to the determination of that question is a review of the framework of the record upon which the District Court's summary judgment order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.735" offset="13226297">The essence of this petitioner's complaint or efforts to charge the respondent with a violation of her rights under Section 703 (a) appears in the two sentences where she said first, that when she gave her application to the receptionist, she was told, she a woman was told that her application -- that the defendant was not considering applications from woman with preschool age children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.292" offset="13344580">She followed this by the general and rather conclusionary charge that the defendant refused to employ her solely on account of her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.634" offset="13393899">We think it appropriate to observe here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.200" offset="13404139">It'd be difficult to imagine a more normal or natural term for the receptionist to use in addressing herself to the petitioner, who was a woman than to use the word women, in speaking to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.140" offset="13475924">Deluding any innuendo which it had otherwise might have add, the petitioner annexed to her complaint a copy of the decision of the EEOC which made no finding or affirmative assertion that the respondent treated women with preschool age children differently than it treated men similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.287" offset="13568502">In fact, it twice referred to the respondent's non-consideration of people with preschool age children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.125" offset="13607894">To the complaint, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike, a motion to strike has no relevancy to this issue and the court while not granting the motion to dismiss as such, the District Court's order struck the allegation based on a refusal to hire the petitioner because she had preschool age children.</text>

            <text syncTime="4647.394" offset="18692995">The court specifically assumed for purposes of the record that they hired men with pre-school-age children and held that immaterial.</text>
