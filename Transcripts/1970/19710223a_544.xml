            <text syncTime="35.270" offset="244485">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.281" offset="256502">This federal income tax case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.255" offset="284400">It raises a question that affects the tax liability of every savings and loan association that insures its depositors’ accounts with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, respondent is such an association.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.116" offset="355871">During 1963, the only taxable year in issue, it paid a regular annual insurance premium for depositors insurance to the Insurance Corporation, amounting to approximately $135,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.152" offset="423999">This payment was required by Section 404 (b) of the National Housing Act and the Commissioner allowed it as an ordinary and necessary business expense deduction under Section 162 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.921" offset="491081">The treatment of this payment is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.306" offset="508635">Also during 1963, respondent contributed an additional $882,000.00 to the Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.027" offset="547506">This contribution was required by Section 404 (d) of the National Housing Act and it is described in the statute as being in the nature of a prepayment with respect to future premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.047" offset="611558">The question presented here is whether the $882,000.00 is an ordinary and necessary business expense of a 1963, on the ground that it is simply an additional cost of current insurance as respondent claims or whether as the Commissioner urges, the $882,000.00 is a capital expenditure, which is deductible in future years, if actually used to pay respondents’ regular annual insurance premiums or to meet insurance losses of the Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.806" offset="758575">In other words, the basic question here is not whether a deduction should be allowed, but when a deduction should be allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.304" offset="904547">The term capital expenditure appears and is defined in Section 263 of the Code.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="210.339" offset="944776">Right, but that issue has been dealt with explicitly by Mr. Justice Blackmun, when he sat on the Eighth Circuit in a case called General Bancshares Corporation, which is not cited in either of the briefs, but was cited below and which is reported at 326 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.244" offset="1024397">There, Mr. Justice Blackmun speaking for unanimous Eighth Circuit, in the case in which this Court subsequently denied certiorari, said this about Section 263, and I quote, “Section 263, with its denial of deductibility for specified capital expenditures, and Section 162 (a), with its grant of deductibility for ordinary and necessary business expenses, are not of course, mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.836" offset="1142680">Neither are they together all inclusive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="262.976" offset="1155323">Section 263 obviously is not in itself an exclusive list of nondeductible capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.931" offset="1187088">Apart from Mr. Justice Blackmun’s comments in that case, this Court only last term in two unanimous decisions in the Woodward and Hilton cases held that appraisal expenses incurred in connection with the evaluation of dissenting shareholders’ stock were nondeductible capital expenditures, but they too are not new buildings or permanent improvement or betterments.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.637" offset="1289906">And the Court did this of course, without mention of the fact that Section 263 has only a limited definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.285" offset="1320521">So, I think it's fair to say, Mr. Justice that this Court has innumerable occasions done that in --</text>

            <text syncTime="311.920" offset="1351032">No, on innumerable occasions, as early as 1938 in Helvering and Winmill, it held that brokerage expenses in the acquisition of capital stock are capital expenditures to be added to the cost of the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.502" offset="2593416">At all relevant times, respondent has been a member of Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and has insured its depositors’ accounts with the Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.079" offset="2639705">Prior to 1962, respondents was required to own stock in itself Federal Home Loan Bank in an amount at least equal to 2% of its mortgage loans and to maintain this percentage of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.005" offset="2699368">Respondent has always capitalized its purchases of such stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.328" offset="2716714">Also prior to 1962, it was required to pay an annual insurance premium to the Insurance Corporation of 1/12 of 1% of all insured accounts and creditor obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.219" offset="2768227">This expense corresponding to the $135,000.00 premium for 1963 has always been allowed as an ordinary and necessary business expense by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.833" offset="2814725">In 1961, Congress changed these requirements, effective January 1, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.541" offset="2845550">This change resulted in the present litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.083" offset="2859656">First, Congress reduced the stock ownership requirement in the Federal Home Loan Bank from 2% to 1% of mortgage loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.280" offset="2896541">Second, it continued the regular annual premium requirement of 1/12 of 1% of savings account and creditor obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.537" offset="2933530">And third, it imposed a new requirement in Section 404 (d), that in certain years each insured institution contribute 2% of any increase in its savings accounts and creditor obligations, during the proceeding year to the Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.376" offset="3008867">Congress thought that the additional contributions required under Section 404 (d) would be about the same as the larger stock purchases that would have been made under the prior Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.033" offset="3055470">Indeed, if the Savings and Loan Association has to purchase any stock to meet the new lower 1% requirement, its obligation under Section 404 (d) is reduced by that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.438" offset="3101132">Regular insurance premiums received by the Insurance Corporation are part of its gross income to the extent that the corporation does not use them to meet its current expenses and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.029" offset="3151496">They are transferred to the Insurance Corporation’s primary reserve which the corporation is directed to establish in the National Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.652" offset="3189948">That reserve contains its cumulative net income and it's available to meet losses if income of any year is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.825" offset="3226624">Section 404 (d) contributions on the other hand, the ones that are here in dispute are not considered part of the Insurance Company’s gross income and are not added to its primary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.510" offset="3277406">They are transferred directly to the Insurance Corporation’s secondary reserve, which the Insurance Corporation also is directed to establish in the National Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.419" offset="3321083">Unlike the primary reserve, this secondary reserve is not freely available to meet expenses and losses of the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.585" offset="3357759">It may be used only to meet losses and only if all of the corporation’s other accounts are first exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.462" offset="3393181">Once respondent makes a regular annual premium payment, that payment is loss to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.626" offset="3417840">The premium obligates the corporation only to provide insurance coverage for the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.784" offset="3442500">On the other hand, the contributions to the Insurance Corporation’s secondary reserve create a beneficial ownership interest in that reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.309" offset="3480639">This interest is evidenced by annual statements which the Insurance Corporation sends to each insured institution each year advising it of its then current share of the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.508" offset="3533406">Respondent’s share of the reserve amounted to nearly $5 million, as of the end of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.393" offset="3568933">This share consists not only of the contributions made by the insured institution, but also includes an annual return on investment at a rate equal to the return earned by the corporation on its investments.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.582" offset="3721697">And I'm trying to give a picture in a way I think can make it simplest for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.549" offset="3741550">Although, an insured institution’s interest in the secondary reserve is not generally transferable, an association may transfer its share in a merger, consolidation, or other similar transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.436" offset="3801109">Moreover, an association is entitled to a cash refund of its share, if it withdraws from the federal insurance system or if it goes into voluntary or involuntary liquidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.508" offset="3853354">I come now to consider how an association share in the secondary reserve is built up and how it is used to pay regular annual insurance payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.389" offset="3900897">Contributions to the secondary reserve, the ones that here in dispute, must be made until the primary and secondary reserves together equal 2% of all savings accounts and creditor obligations of all insured institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.965" offset="3975189">When that point is reached, the obligation to make secondary reserve contributions is temporarily suspended, while it remained suspended, an association share in the secondary reserve is used to pay its regular annual insurance premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.599" offset="4045720">This reduces its share in the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.318" offset="4060662">Now, if a particular savings and loan association has no remaining share in the secondary reserve, while the obligation to make contributions to the secondary reserve is generally suspended, it pays its annual insurance premium in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.208" offset="4128162">The use of shares in the secondary reserve to discharge the regular annual insurance premiums continues until the total of the primary and secondary reserves falls below 1.75% of all insured accounts and creditor obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.448" offset="4845171">All that this Court needs to understand about this complicated arrangement is that in some years, like 1963, an association will be making regular premium payments in cash, and also, contributing to the secondary reserve in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.724" offset="4910268">In other years, for example this year, it will make no cash payments and its regular annual premium will be paid out of its share of the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.496" offset="4957393">I think the matter can be further clarified if we look at what has actually happen since 1962, when this scheme went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.122" offset="4991875">From 1962 through 1969, respondents paid regular premiums and cash, and also made contributions to the secondary reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.025" offset="5063450">By the end of 1969, the total of the primary and the secondary reserves reach the 2% level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.660" offset="5093961">Consequently, the obligation to make payments to the secondary reserve was suspended and respondent’s regular annual premium was paid of its share of the secondary reserve in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.218" offset="5148296">It will continue to be paid out of the secondary reserve this year, and for the next several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.122" offset="5171911">Respondent’s position is that no deduction should be allowed during these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.251" offset="5188420">We say that a deduction should be allowed for the regular annual premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.425" offset="5205034">In short, under respondent’s method, deductions for insurance coverage would be bunched in the years, in which it makes contributions to the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.674" offset="5246098">Under our method, the cost of the insurance would be spread over the entire period, by allowing a deduction each year for the regular annual premium, irrespective of whether it is paid in cash or out of an association share of the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.811" offset="5322585">The tax court upheld the Government’s position in the unanimous reviewed decision that these payments into the secondary reserve constituted capital outlays, if I may use that word. The Ninth Circuit reversed in a 2 to 1 decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.269" offset="6164459">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.741" offset="6182327">We are certainly in agreement with the Government here that this question not to turn upon what the payments in question really are or were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.403" offset="6229034">It is a taxpayer’s position that in essence the payments were primarily insurance premiums and constituted ordinary and necessary business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.276" offset="6280443">To go back to 1961, when the legislation in question was introduced, each association was required to pay an insurance premium of 1/12 of 1% of its savings accounts and creditor’s obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.145" offset="6347943">I will not keep repeating creditor’s obligations, but I refer to them by including them in savings accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.418" offset="6385037">Had the savings and loan industry remained static, those insurance premiums of 1/12 of 1% would have produced a 2% reserve in approximately 24 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.069" offset="6447626">But of course with tremendous growth of the Savings and Loan Association, to continue to collect only 1/12 of 1% did not keep pace with the ultimate insurance risk, which the statute has imposed upon the FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.512" offset="6521396">And therefore, Congress when it introduced the Act in question, stated in both of the Committee Reports, that there is general agreement that some action should be taken to build up the corporation’s reserves at a faster rate, after pointing out the extent to which they had declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.360" offset="6620766">And therefore, the legislation took the form of continuing the premium of 1/12 of 1%, but the additional element that was then introduced was that if any association had an increase in its insurance -- in its savings deposits; it would have to pay this additional premium of 2% of the amount of the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.645" offset="6729958">And to us it is significant that this is right in line with the element of a premium for insurance, it's an attempt to measure the cost of protection by the increased risk that the insurance is company is put to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.694" offset="6798190">For example, in our particular case, Lincoln’s savings accounts at the beginning of 1962 amounted to approximately $90 million and they increase during 1962 to $135 million, with the result that the potential insurance risk of the FSLIC, which it was obliged by law to insure was increased by $44 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.966" offset="6923264">And to us, the essence of what Congress required was that because of the additional insurance risk, thus imposed upon the FSLIC, thus should be paid a 2% of that increase as a premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.358" offset="6988779">Not a premium to take effect 10 years later when there might be a bookkeeping entry transferring an amount from a secondary reserve to a primary reserve, but an insurance risk that it was assumed immediately in 1962 because of the increased savings accounts of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.084" offset="7079685">So therefore, it seems to us that basically the nature and the substance of what was paid was a premium measured directly to the increased insurance risk assumed by the FSLIC and therefore, it meets basically the criteria of an ordinary expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.335" offset="7160665">On the other hand, undoubtedly may have been associations, which experienced no increase in their savings deposits, as such an association, there would have been no increase insurance risk assumed by the FSLIC, there would have been no increase premium paid by such an association which to us gives further illustration of the fact that this really was in essence the payment for an insurance risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.832" offset="7338715">You seem to draw a distinction between one whose deposits had increased substantially and one whose deposits had not increased substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.348" offset="7380720">Do I understand you to imply, I don’t think you said it bluntly, that for the latter one there would be mo deduction?</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.840" offset="7414784">That’s true, Your Honor, because there would be no payment due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.136" offset="7427950">In other words, if an association did not increase its deposits, it would pay nothing more than the original 1/12 of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.655" offset="7465984">It would not pay it as 2% and therefore, having paid nothing that of course wouldn’t be entitled to no deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.183" offset="7528155">Let me carry on one more, what then is the statutory purpose in setting out both 404 (b) and 404 (d)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.618" offset="7557831">Why do you think they’re separated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Adam Y. Bennion</label>
            <text syncTime="1866.806" offset="7570578">This will have to be my own personal opinion, because I cannot climb into the minds of Congress, but I think it was primarily a device to bring about fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.409" offset="7621047">The plan of the insurance statute from the very beginning has been that there will come a time when the reserves reach a certain point, when all payment of insurance premiums will be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.135" offset="7683950">Under the original Act, it was 5% then it was reduced to 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.118" offset="7699832">So, there has been inherent in every payment of every premium, the possibility of a future benefit, when that reserve reached that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.012" offset="7735463">Now, I personally think the reason they adopted this complicated formula and said, “We’ll charge the growing associations an additional 2%,” was that when the combined primary and secondary reserve should reach 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.512" offset="7837445">And therefore, there should be a suspension of payments, under the congressional determination that 2% was enough to cover the risk, that early suspension would be available only to the growing associations which had paid this additional premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.975" offset="7911320">Whereas, if you had an association which had paid no secondary premiums and therefore, had no secondary account, there would be nothing to transfer on their account, and therefore they would have to continue to pay the 1/12 of 1% premium until the primary premium by itself got to be 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.507" offset="8005360">And I believe that that is the only reason for this exceedingly technical and complicated formula was set up, just as a matter of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.129" offset="8043917">And I think it is fair, I think that the associations that had been growing and have been building up this fund and paying the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.653" offset="8086026">When the 2% is arrived at which Congress thought was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.979" offset="8103267">That’s fine, let's give these associations a little bit of (Inaudible), while the others who have not been contributing will continue until all of the funds are transferred over to the primary reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.369" offset="8244851">Now, from a practical standpoint, the Government has referred to this transfer of a part of the Lincoln’s account from the secondary reserve to the primary reserve, as an event which should give rise to a deduction at that time and also, which prevents a distortion of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.304" offset="8364596">I’d like to just call your attention to what seems to me to be a true distortion of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.581" offset="8389674">Under the Government’s theory, and as the Government said, this transfer started, as far as Lincoln is concerned in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.313" offset="8440665">Under the Government’s theory, the original payment of this $800,000.00 although was completely beyond the control of the taxpayer and in our view, had gone for insurance, is set upon the taxpayer’s book as an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.338" offset="8512763">Now in 1970, when the whole industry reserve gets up to 2% and instead of having to pay the original 1/12 of 1%, the taxpayer has the benefit of having transferred, let's say $500,000.00 from the secondary reserve to the primary reserve, this has the effect on the financial statements of the taxpayer of telling the public that is now, its net worth has now decreased to $500,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.840" offset="8666781">And yet, from a practical standpoint, the day before that transfer was made and the day after that was made, we had exactly the same transfer, as far as anybody can tell from the outside, it's worth exactly what it was and yet, under the Government’s treatment, you show a decrease in net worth of a half million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.110" offset="10307793">It was really not the Ninth Circuit, when we finished our argument, there said and asked us if we would next time bring a complicating case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.182" offset="10344051">I tell you the complication arising out of what had just been mentioned here is tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.018" offset="10367457">Actually, the industry is facing this exact situation right now, where in 1970, there were transfers made out of the secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.736" offset="10410297">And the associations don’t know what was transferred, whether their contributions, whether the income, and therefore, my recollection is that the only instructions they have so far from the FSLIC is to treat it the way you want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.804" offset="10486575">But it is true that as far as the income is concerned, it seems to be it would be a wash transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.659" offset="10509981">The income would become taxable and then it would be deductible because it applied on this obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.851" offset="10542791">But the whole business of credit in this return, forgetting for a moment the possibility of refunds on termination or liquidation, really is of no great moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.223" offset="10612276">The amount that’s credited from the primary reserve to the secondary reserve simply increases the secondary and decreases the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.326" offset="10680717">And yet, any benefit to be derived by any taxpayer, depends upon when the combined primary and secondary reserves reach 2%, so that the mere fact the one is increased, and the other decreased, really is not that significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.791" offset="10870575">One of the final arguments of the Government and in this respect, the reliance was placed primarily upon an argument, which the Tax Court of the United States developed, and that is the legislative history of the statute proves that the payment is not an insurance premium, but was intended as a capital investment in the FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.502" offset="11005367">We have searched the legislative history and can find nothing in support of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.839" offset="11034728">The tax court even said that the secondary reserve and the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank were fungible, which to us indicated a failure to grasp the completely different functions of the two agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.647" offset="11101915">The Federal Home Loan Bank Board is a credit organization and an association by stock in that board, and thereby becomes entitled to borrow from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.348" offset="11152802">On the other hand, the FSLIC is solely an insurance company and is concerned solely with insuring the accounts of the savings depositors of the FSLIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.754" offset="11214346">The only reference between the two in Congress was that in order to lighten the financial burden upon taxpayers that had to pay the addition of 2% insurance premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.720" offset="11266278">The amount required to be paid in for the bank stock was reduced from 2 to 1% because as Congress said there was general agreement that the bank was overcapitalized, whereas, the insurance company needed to greatly expand its insurance reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.693" offset="11350183">Other -- there is no connection whatsoever in function or purpose of the two payments, and we think the fundamental fallacy of the tax court here was this point that this was in the nature of capital because it was fungible with a bank stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.750" offset="11434402">We think if there's absolutely no basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.986" offset="11527293">If it please the Court, I think that covers most of our arguments, other than those that we’ve set forth in our brief and this is a complicated thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.646" offset="11565955">We certainly agree with the Government that really the essence of these payments should govern whether they are deductible expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.123" offset="11595839">We think that the Government concedes that they were necessary expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.413" offset="11612975">We think the fact show that they are ordinary and it all goes faced in a similar situation to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.363" offset="11640874">And we do not believe that there was any element of the capital expenditure or a capital investment involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.416" offset="11677027">I think the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.747" offset="12110346">Let us suppose that there had been a lot of fires in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.247" offset="12124348">And a local ordinance is passed requiring each business in that locality to obtain each year, from a local fire department, a certificate of fire safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.848" offset="12174712">Let's suppose in order to obtain that certificate of fire safety, guards have to be posted on the business premises each night, and also a modern up-to-date sprinkler system has to be installed on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.026" offset="12231450">I would suggest that although the salaries of the guards are ordinary and necessary business expenses, that this Court would hold unanimously that the cost of the sprinkler system is a capital expenditure, this time within the meaning of Section 263, even though, and if I may quote from the respondent’s brief, “the purpose of making both expenditures is the same, the compulsion of making both expenditures is the same, and the consequence of not making both expenditures is the same.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.590" offset="12385782">Precisely and an expression from this Court on that issue, I think would do a great deal to resolve for a lot of tax cases that are now pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.584" offset="12429667">Well, can there be any -- does anyone seriously raise any question that the cost of sprinkler system would be amortized over its useful life?</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.279" offset="12464462">It seems to us Mr. Chief Justice that respondent’s argument here, principal argument in its brief, which they did not elaborate this afternoon is that it had to pay the Section 404 (d) payments, under the National Housing Act, it had to pay them, that’s what the Ninth Circuit said, that’s why they held adversely to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.059" offset="12543561">And we say the fact that you have to pay them, doesn’t -- isn’t of any more significance in the resolution of this case than the fact that you require to put in a sprinkler system. The question is whether you have an asset within the meaning of those regulations, with the useful life extending substantially beyond the close of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.579" offset="12617644">And that question is the same, whether it be a sprinkler system or the contributions to the secondary reserve that are involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.215" offset="12660276">Suppose that in this insurance scheme, there were a formula that fix the amount to be paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.697" offset="12726209">I realized that mathematically it could be a little difficult to do that at the end of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.366" offset="12772812">Right, the hypothetical you put is very similar to a ruling relating to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which is cited in both briefs and which we think is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.738" offset="12814294">And under that ruling, the banks would pay a premium each year, and we’d get back any excess in the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.790" offset="12850552">And the question was whether that was an ordinary, necessary business expense and the Internal Revenue Service rule that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.261" offset="12880436">The reason that it ruled that it was, was this, the only reason the money wasn’t paid back at the end of the same year was if the FDIC couldn’t go and make all the computations to figure out how much was going to be needed to cover the expenses and losses of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.420" offset="12945011">You didn’t have an asset with the useful life extending substantially beyond the close of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.743" offset="12966327">The refund was made within a few months of the succeeding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.062" offset="12979597">As I said, we rely on this regulation, which we think squarely fits this case.</text>
