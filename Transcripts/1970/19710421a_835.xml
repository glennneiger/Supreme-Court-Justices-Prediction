            <text syncTime="34.844" offset="242709">Mr. Dewey has been working at Reynolds Metals Company since the district judge ordered him reinstated to the present date.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.189" offset="308120">The last time, Sunday, work was scheduled at that Reynolds’ plant was in November of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.793" offset="350542">The statute involved in this case, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 703 (a) (1), deleting the material not bearing on religion would say, “it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual’s religion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="84.626" offset="441866">The clause in the entire section or otherwise to discriminate against, I believe, defines discharge for religion as discrimination and thus the language is rather broad in prohibiting discharge for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.434" offset="533086">While religion is difficult to define precisely, I think there are at least two elements always present in that they are beliefs on the one hand and conduct flowing out of these beliefs on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.627" offset="629844">Except in the Chamber of Commerce brief, they would interpret the statute to cover and protect naked belief only rather than conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.329" offset="692642">This Court has applied the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.392" offset="720959">I’m thinking particularly of Griggs against Duke Power which was decided March 8 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.194" offset="764113">And the Court said that the face of a rule or even the uniform application of the rule is not an adequate matter for investigation “but Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices not simply the motivation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="191.746" offset="870379">This of course followed the Court’s doctrine in the constitutional free exercise of religion also in such a case as Sherbert against Verner and Barnett where it is the effect of discrimination rather than the face of the rule that counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.567" offset="1033592">Mr. Chief Justice, this is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.425" offset="1041115">That case involved that kind of a fact situation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="238.846" offset="1058774">But do you claim any long history of discriminatory practices against religious beliefs in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_oosterhouse" startTime="247.358" stopTime="675.493">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Oosterhouse</label>
            <text syncTime="247.358" offset="1092838">No, we do not, but we do claim that the language which this Court used in Griggs is broad enough to cover more than the bare fact situation in that case that the approach to this Act is to look at consequences of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.700" offset="1222196">Reynolds’ defense that this rule of required over time applied uniformly to all people whether they had religious objections to working on Sunday or not, we claim therefore, is not an adequate defense because the effect of this rule is to put a person with Dewey’s religious beliefs to a choice that no other employee is put to and that is of either sacrificing his job or sacrificing his religious convictions was precisely this kind of a conflict which this Court disapproved of in Sherbert against Verner, even though that was under the Constitution I think the principle of interpretation is applicable to the conflict between religion and employment under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.187" offset="1520097">The commission charged with enforcement of this Act has adopted regulations and it has by the regulations adopted an intermediate interpretation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.719" offset="1594284">As I indicated before the Chamber of Commerce brief would have us apply the protection of the Civil Rights Act only to belief, not to conduct flowing from that belief at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.038" offset="1655515">The language of the statute itself is very broad in prohibiting discharge because of religion without any reference to the degree of hardship which might result from continuing the employment of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.949" offset="1723120">The regulations adopt an intermediate interpretation, saying that a person maybe discharged because of religion, if to do otherwise would create undue hardship upon an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.672" offset="1794069">The regulations place the burden of proof of showing this undue hardship also on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.088" offset="1839731">In this case, the accommodation which is required by the regulations could have been easily accomplished and I think that the employer here has completely failed in his burden of proof to show that to accommodate would have created undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.228" offset="1952266">The evidence indicates that there were, on each of the Sundays involved, several people in Dewey’s classification who were not assigned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.860" offset="2018826">The evidence shows that Mr. Dewey was the only person in this classification with the religious convictions against Sunday work.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.308" offset="2060622">The evidence also shows that there were two persons outside of the classification who were qualified and that in fact on one of the three Sundays involved, Reynolds did ask one of these persons outside of the classification to work and he did work.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.906" offset="2147035">And there were no great problems according to the facts which are before this Court resulting from Reynolds doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.631" offset="2181935">We submit that on the basis of the evidence presented, there is nothing to show that Reynolds was unable to accommodate by getting volunteers to take Dewey’s place on the three Sundays in question and that’s an accommodation even short of using their Compulsory Overtime Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.422" offset="2301053">I don’t think that we on the evidence, even have to get in to the Compulsory Overtime Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.588" offset="2329684">They could have done it without directing an employee to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.393" offset="2352985">They could have done it by asking another employee to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.076" offset="2375659">However, even if use of the Compulsory Overtime Clause had been required, I think this is still in the area of reasonable accommodation and does not show undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.371" offset="2428844">Reynolds claims that at one point, some 10 years prior to the three Sundays which Dewey was involved, they had trouble obtaining enough people to do overtime work, but this was before their contract contained any Compulsory Overtime Clause, so I don’t think that that constitutes any evidence whatsoever of undue hardship in Dewey’s situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.605" offset="2561755">Their other claim of undue hardship is that to accommodate Dewey would completely negate their Compulsory Overtime Clause and I submit that this too is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.284" offset="2636466">If the statute is as we interpret it, it will supersede the provisions of the contract only to the very narrow extent necessary to comply with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.084" offset="2707728">If the law be that accommodation must be made on the basis of religious belief, this does not mean as Reynolds argues that accommodation has to be made for every personal reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.781" offset="2766451">The statute only lists specific classifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.067" offset="2891630">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.735" offset="2906363">This is the third case under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to be argued in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.538" offset="2945546">The first two cases were decided earlier this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.337" offset="2964668">In all three cases, the complaint had been acted upon by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prior to the filing of suit as the law requires, but because of statutory differences between the enforcement powers of that commission and the powers of other federal agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was not a party to any of these three suits in the federal courts to enforce Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.302" offset="3112626">Since we believe that this Court’s decisions in these cases are in many ways as vital to the work and responsibilities of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as this Court’s decisions under the statutes, other agencies administer are to those agencies and since the Attorney General also has important statutory responsibilities for the enforcement of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.503" offset="3233416">The United States filed an amicus brief in each of the three cases and asked to participate in the oral argument in each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.193" offset="3268106">And in two of the three cases including the present one, the Court granted our request to participate in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.108" offset="3307813">Now, the District Court’s judgment in this case in favor of the petitioner was reversed by the Court of Appeals on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.235" offset="3348355">And we believe that the Court of Appeals was wrong on both grounds and that the District Court’s judgment should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.040" offset="3387538">The first ground of reversal was that arbitration under the collective agreement foreclose suit in the Courts under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.408" offset="3429021">This holding is of great concern to us because of the severe impact it would have on all of the rights against discrimination conferred by Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.632" offset="4829915">We pointed out in that case that the dissenting justices emphasized the fact that the statutory penalty in those circumstances depended quoting from Mr. Justice White’s opinion “entirely an interpretation and application of the bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.116" offset="4907865">We're not involved with that kind of right at all here and for other reasons that we discuss in the course of the brief, we don’t think that the difficulties of that case are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.722" offset="4966275">Here, all the arbitrator decided was that the discharge of petitioner did not violate the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, containing no anti discrimination provision relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.738" offset="5038373">In other words, under the Court of Appeals holding, the petitioner is entitled to virtually nothing more than he would have had if Title VII had never been enacted, a decision by the arbitrator about whether the Collective Bargaining Agreement afforded a protection or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.497" offset="5117367">I say virtually nothing more because he did have the benefit of conciliation efforts on his behalf by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that those efforts are likely to be of little effect in a situation in which any possibility of enforcing Title VII will be foreclosed and because of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.737" offset="5218304">Now we believe that in enacting Title VII, Congress did accomplish more than this otherwise, a large category of employees covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements would be virtually denied the benefits of Title VII which to us is a very important matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.208" offset="5304195">Although the relationship between arbitration in Title VII rights was not explicitly discussed in the legislative history of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.112" offset="5343796">Congress was of course aware in 1964 of the widespread use of arbitration under collective agreements and this is another distinction of the Arguelles case where you were dealing with an old statute and yet the whole design and intent reflected in Title VII was to confer an ultimate individual right to sue that would not displace all the rights, but would be an addition to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.202" offset="5464168">We elaborate that in our brief and this is all taken into account in the decisions of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits which have held that the selection of rights doctrine is inappropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.433" offset="5521115">Those decisions I cited on page 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.762" offset="5546402">And their holding is that arbitration under the collective agreement and remedies under Title VII may each be separately pursued to judgment, so long as double recovery is not allowed which we think is the proper approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.149" offset="5631979">It may be coincidental that the same remedy is appropriate if rights under both the collective agreement and Title VII have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.688" offset="5674088">In this case, no right under the collective agreement was violated by the employer, so that issue doesn’t even arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.132" offset="5719855">There are important differences between arbitration and the Title VII rights which we think justify this view and one is the fact previously mentioned that the submission of the grievance to the arbitrator is controlled by the union whereas Congress in Title VII conferred the right to sue on the individual complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.647" offset="5833958">And it is significant in this context that Congress found it appropriate to afford protection under Title VII against discrimination by the unions as well as by employers and thought that this was a comparable problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.446" offset="5893204">And although in this case, no claim of bad faith when the union’s representations is made, it is not worthy that in the grievance proceeding before the arbitrator, the employer was represented by a lawyer, the union was not and the employer filed a post-hearing brief and the union did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.613" offset="5993827">We think it’s significant that Congress gave of the complainant the right to control his own litigation under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.815" offset="6030608">Another important difference and I think the crucially important difference is that the scope of judicial review of an arbitrator’s award is very limited and this is appropriate because arbitrators are applying the disparate provisions of private agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.818" offset="6106676">But in Title VII, Congress conferred the statutory right on individual and provided for it’s enforcement through the normal judicial processes which assured greater uniformity in the interpretation and application of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.952" offset="6179192">And there’s a corresponding public interest in assuring that access to the Courts is available because the availability of that access encourages compliance with the act as the courts have interpreted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.416" offset="7505063">None of the -- the only difference of substance between the earlier ones and the later ones is that earlier ones gave a number of examples of the application, none of which that these precise facts and so the general standard in the earlier one in our view is the governing standard and that is essentially the same as the general standard applied by the District Court in relying on the 1967 guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.330" offset="7620733">It’s set forth in the 1966 guideline on page 41, appendix B of our brief and the commission there referred to an obligation on the part of the employer to accommodate to the reasonable religious needs of employees so long as this can be done without serious inconvenience to the conduct of the business of virtually identical formulation of the 1967 formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.484" offset="7749360">And this approach which is very similar to the Griggs approach seems to us entirely appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.498" offset="7785409">Its application in this case is indeed much less disruptive of the employer’s preferences than was the application of the general business necessity standard in the Griggs case because there the employer was required to give up its high school diploma and testing qualifications altogether for jobs to which they were not shown to be job-related and here are the respondent is free to retain its over time substitute policy just as it has been applying it and all it need do is make a simple accommodation to the religious needs of this employee by arranging itself for a voluntary substitute for the petitioner rather than insisting that the petitioner make the arrangement which is a very minor intrusion it seems to us on is the employer’s preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.238" offset="8028348">The record shows that at least four possible substitutes were available on each of the Sundays in question and the respondent did not show that it could not arrange for one of them to work voluntarily in petitioner’s place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.963" offset="8099192">It seems to us, it was the respondent’s burden to make a showing just as this Court held in Griggs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.687" offset="8878164">Indeed, the argument is made that this application of the Act would violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.592" offset="8901778">It seems to us to be almost exactly the same preference that this Court held in Sherbert against Verner, was required in the circumstances of that case under the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.214" offset="8956217">It seems a little strange to us to be making the argument so much the other way with that case in West Virginia Board of Education against Barnette and Zorach against Clauson on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.097" offset="9003760">I think actually the case that’s most closely in point of the Sunday closing law cases decided by this Court in the 1960 term and in one of those cases Braunfeld against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.943" offset="9059140">The Court held that while an exemption for Sabbatarians is not constitutionally required, it is constitutionally permissible and indeed the opinion of the Court said that may well be the wiser way of handling the problem of Sunday closing laws, even though it could be argued that, that gives Sabbatarians advantages to compete on Saturdays in a way that others can’t compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.206" offset="9192155">There is also an argument advanced here by the respondent that even if the District Court was otherwise correct, it should not have awarded back pay because the respondent relied in good faith on the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the respondent there cites a District Court decision in Oregon in which the District judge did not award back pay because the respondent there had relied on a state statute, limiting the weights that can be lifted by women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.830" offset="9346696">We don’t think, in the first place, we do not endorse the decision of the District Court in Oregon, but we don’t think it is really apposite here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.981" offset="9383267">The respondent here was not in any dilemma comparable to that of the employer in Oregon arguably was in, where he felt he would be violating a requirement of state law if he exceeded to the request of his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.101" offset="9455783">Here, although the Collective bargaining Agreement, the arbitrator held, empowered the respondent to fire Dewey, it certainly did not require the respondent to fire Dewey in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.764" offset="9518477">And the respondent could hardly claim that it felt its obligations under the agreement to the union required that it fired Dewey since the union took exactly the opposite position throughout the grievance preceding that the employer should not fire Dewey because of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.617" offset="9593814">And so in sum argue is if the District Court properly applied the Act here in accordance with the congressional intent to protect religious freedom and diversity in this country from unnecessary rigidities in the employment practices of institutional employer such as the respondent and accordingly we asked that the District Court’s judgment be reinstated.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Coughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2429.548" offset="9821602">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.486" offset="9837275">This an action for money damages and reinstatement of position brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.464" offset="9873220">The respondent Reynolds Metals Company discharged petitioner Dewey because he violated the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement entered into by his union and his employer Reynolds Metals Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.815" offset="9922644">The violation consisted of his refusing to work on three overtime Sunday assignments when assigned pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement and his refusing each of the Sundays in question to arrange for a replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.697" offset="9986173">This was an ultimate procedure which had been extensively used by all employees including petitioner Dewey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.292" offset="10012505">If you’ll bear with me and we feel strongly about this, there are six separate grounds which establish in this matter that the respondent did not violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and I would like to briefly outline them and then go to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.642" offset="10081991">One, in this case, the discharge did not violate the Civil Rights Act in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.030" offset="10115532">Two, the Act itself, the Civil Rights Act itself contains a number of exemptions, exceptions and limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.582" offset="10145729">Reynolds falls within the particular exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.752" offset="10158373">Three, the Government through the EEOC has stated that the prohibition against discrimination for religious reasons includes an obligation to accommodate religious group also. Respondent argues there is no legal basis under this Act for an accommodation and the enforcement of accommodation by the EEOC may well be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.275" offset="10256488">Four, even if accommodation required as a part of prohibition against discrimination the EEOC has issued guidelines which in two instances in 1966 read up by the conduct the Reynolds Metals Company and in a third part of the 1966 guideline, we accommodated in the words of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.879" offset="10346872">Five, because of the wording of the Act itself which call in the remedial section thereof requiring intentional violation which Mr. Wallace just referred to, we don’t think there’s any right under the law to reinstatement of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.990" offset="10403297">And finally under the election of remedies theory, the case shouldn’t even be here as the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated, but I would say that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in ruling on this case went to the merits first and then to the procedure and so it's well done in our estimation at this point that the whole matter can be clarified because the individual involved, the petitioner does not suffer on the procedural basis, you have before you both the merits and the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.600" offset="10513742">I’d like to go to the first of our basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.532" offset="10529520">We don’t think under any interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, whether you go discrimination by intent or discrimination by effect that there’s any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.829" offset="10566719">The objective of the Act as was said in the Griggs case is to achieve equal employment opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.703" offset="10594200">This objective is to be achieved through prohibiting selected forms employment discrimination involving religion, race, color, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.200" offset="10636204">What is discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.010" offset="10643414">It isn’t defined in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.380" offset="10652923">The classical definition has to do and it’s that of making a distinction or making a difference in treatment between one employer and another, based on religion in this particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.687" offset="10694092">The more important question, I suppose, is what kind of discrimination is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.122" offset="10715826">What are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.861" offset="10722826">Are we’re talking about discrimination by intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.900" offset="10734947">Are we’re talking about discrimination by effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.337" offset="10748740">I would summit to you that if you look at the legislation and I know you gentlemen are much more familiar with it than I, but nevertheless I submit that if you look at the Act itself, for instance, 703 (h) in this particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.693" offset="10814151">It says, “an employer may have different -- may apply different terms and conditions to an employee,” and then the magic language, “if it is provided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.375" offset="10852916">If it’s based on a bona fide seniority system.“</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.838" offset="10862738">provided there is no intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.280" offset="10880502">Go to 706 (g); the remedial relief under this Act as envisaged by Congress was to be applied reinstatement and back pay and injunctive action if the employer has intentionally engaged in unlawful employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.684" offset="10958137">Both sections seem directed at discrimination by intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.368" offset="10976841">Let me quote to you, if you will, and it is very hard in the legislative debates because of the way that the Act was passed and the format that it went through the Senate and the House, but at the time that it was passed then Senator Humphrey had this to say, and he was talking about Section 706 (g) and he said in part, “706 (g) is amended to require a showing of intentional violation of the Title in order to obtain relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.212" offset="11092198">This is a clarifying change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.032" offset="11103483">Since the Title bars only discrimination because of race, color, religions, sex and national origin, it would seem already to require intent and thus the proposed change does not involve any substantive change in the Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.459" offset="11157191">The express requirement of intent is designed to make it wholly clear that inadvertent or accidental discriminations will not violate the Title or result an entry of court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.041" offset="11199509">It means simply that the respondent must have intended -- must have intended to discriminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.789" offset="11430536">A further support for this definition of intent is found in the views expressed by Senators Joseph Clark and Clifford Case, the floor managers over Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.453" offset="11481213">In their interpretation -- in their interpretive memorandum concerning Title VII, they noted inter alia, “It has been suggested that the concept of discrimination is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.032" offset="11523532">In fact, it is clear and simple and has no hidden meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.597" offset="11541713">To discriminate is to make a distinction, to make a difference in treatment or favor and those distinctions are differences in treatment or favor which are prohibited by 704,” which was later changed to 703 when the Act to came out, “are those which are based on any five of the forbidden criteria: race, color, religion, sex and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.212" offset="11620185">Any other criterion or qualification for employment is not affected by this Title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.237" offset="11644322">The reference is 110 Congressional Records 7230.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.350" offset="11680789">I submit that with this background, I would like to take you to the actual facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.719" offset="11714226">Prior to 1960, this plant located on the outskirts of Grand Rapids, Michigan was found it impossible not difficult as the district judge said, but as the stipulation says found it impossible to work in overtime situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.857" offset="11798758">This was because of the fact that overtime under the UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement was based on a voluntary overtime proposition as far as employees were concerned and the plant found it or the management found it impossible to operate on overtime situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.455" offset="11881200">The company negotiated with the UAW in 1960 as the bargaining agent and achieved the Compulsory Work Clause which provides for the allocation of overtime work equally among the classification on a voluntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.080" offset="11943685">And let me explain to you briefly how that’s done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.373" offset="11956851">In that situation, when there is an overtime situation, according to union contract, you equalize, you go to the classification and you at first, where there is an attempt to equalize the overtime opportunities, go to the low man in the classification, low man on overtime as far as overtime is concerned, his past experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.180" offset="12052041">He is given first opportunity and then the next man and the next man based on his -- whether where they are on the overtime regardless of seniority for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.349" offset="12088717">If enough people volunteer then there is no reason to go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.405" offset="12108988">If you don’t have enough people then you go to the low man in the classification by seniority and you compulse until you get enough people to work the overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.259" offset="12156426">This compulsory overtime was necessary in this plant to enable the company to work in overtime situations when business demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.991" offset="12211388">This is in the sense, a job shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.470" offset="12221210">They do not produce for storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.509" offset="12233435">They produce on the basis of orders and as the orders to accommodate your customers to compete with Alcoa and Kaiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.202" offset="12264155">This is the necessity that arises at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.086" offset="12275754">This was the business necessity to enable this plan to work on six and seven days and also to work in a normal overtime situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.723" offset="12306265">Beyond that, the substitute program was instituted in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.207" offset="12332178">By the substitute program we mean that if an individual wanted a day off for whatever reason, be it religion or otherwise, he could have a day off, but under the compulsory overtime, the responsibility was his to seek out a substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.978" offset="12387244">This system of accommodation was inaugurated in 1965, long before the EEOC suggested accommodation by guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3893.356" offset="15676792">The right in Title VII that’s alleged is discrimination against the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.172" offset="15696018">The remedy is reinstatement back pay under arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.589" offset="15709706">The remedy under Title VII is restatement of back pay and my answer is that I think in this situation that the rights are the same and there are two four of it are available, but you can't go both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.028" offset="15771460">And in answer to your question, I think you could make clause of that sort possibly, but I suppose it might not be applicable in every case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3929.521" offset="15821406">In this particular case, Mr. Chief Justice, the rights and remedies are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.614" offset="15837811">The Hutchings case says that there are two causes of action here and you can see that and look at the distinction between the rights and remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.275" offset="15876472">Hutchings and Bowe both say that analysis doesn’t bear the amount in this case and there’s one cause of action or one claim in this case, one common claim and really we don’t quarrel with whichever way you go, whether you go the arbitration route or whether you the civil rights litigation route, but go on -- and go both at the same time if you wish but when you get a judgment at one, it should be foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.688" offset="15962154">And in that regard, in that regard if this Court should go the concurrent remedy route, an interesting thing will come to pass, I believe, in this that the vitality of arbitration is its finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.745" offset="16030386">In this particular situation, if you go, if you espouse a concurrent route, every employee will write his grievance in the language of the contract, in a discipline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.511" offset="16081377">I was disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.566" offset="16085661">I didn’t get a promotion, I didn’t get my vacation on time, you discipline me or you took me out of line to seniority and it will add one of the word in every grievance and that word will either be age and we all have it one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.324" offset="16140622">It will be sex, we all have it one way or another, religion, generally we have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.603" offset="16165804">Color, we have it one way or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.134" offset="16175940">And so in that case each individual add one word and it doesn’t have to be too cleverly done, then the matter will be submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.563" offset="16213661">If the employee wins, that’s the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.455" offset="16229230">If the employee loses, Mr. Chief Justice, at that point, he said that was too bad that was a bad ride, now, I will go on to my second of my two rides to the litigation route by statute under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.132" offset="16291924">And I say to you that as far as you union contracts are concerned that I can foresee very quickly that that vitality of that arbitration as a final and binding rule is gone and the Government says in its brief at a certain juncture, “Now look, what we really mean in this case is you as an employer get a quid pro quo for arbitration is a no straight clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.228" offset="16388263">I grant you that but there is also a significant thing that when you get arbitration as a final step, it won’t be final anymore because these things are the basic essences of life when you take those things that are on the Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="4226.301" offset="17008619">I'm going to ask your friend if he will comment on that in rebuttal, if they wish, but what would your reaction be to that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_a_coughlin_jr" startTime="4235.274" stopTime="5703.695">
            <label>Mr. William A. Coughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4235.274" offset="17044459">Let me say this; that the hypothetical that you impose and the actual case before you, in other words, the union shop clause is negotiate -- the Taft-Hartley or the Labor Management Relations Act says that that union shop is a -- can be negotiated and it is negotiated and practically in every UAW contract with which we’re most familiar the union shop is in being.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.292" offset="17144560">And it -- and also, in the case before you, the Taft-Hartley also says that overtime -- negotiation in overtime is a compulsory matter of negotiation between the parties and it can be negotiated, so that Taft-Hartley approves both of these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.986" offset="17219271">And your question to me I gather is that if there is a conflict between these situations as far as religion I have to say at this juncture, at the present state of the law, that I would say that as long as the application is made to -- as long as the law is in its present state and you apply the law to everybody the same rule, there isn’t any discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.253" offset="17336404">The question I think that you’re getting at or what I sense and in this sense is what has the Civil Rights Act done as far as espousing discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.644" offset="17385932">Some say and I think this is in direct answer to your question, what they really did, what Congress really did was they took the First Amendment and moved it into the Civil Rights Act of 1964, I say and that would be that you can freely exercise your religion and employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.218" offset="17448208">I submit to you sir that the language -- if the Congress wanted to do that, they could very well have done it but they didn’t do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.063" offset="17479659">So the question is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not involve a First Amendment transplant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.663" offset="17514036">I think what it does do is equal employment opportunity and it says, “Look, will you please treat everybody the same as far as religion is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.158" offset="17551966">Treat them the same as far as sex is concerned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.629" offset="17561893">For instance, in Martin Marietta that was before you, you say -- the Court says that you can't treat married woman differently from married man, this is equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.013" offset="17611421">So, that under those circumstances -- under those circumstances as far as your question is concerned, I must say that as far as I'm concerned, I think that the Civil Rights Act would not prohibit -- would not strike down the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.959" offset="17691251">In my -- in summary on the interpretation of the Act, the objective as far as we are concerned and we see the Act as equal employment opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.355" offset="17728763">However, the Act prescribes discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, words from Griggs v. Duke Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.269" offset="17760423">In our estimation, Dewey is requesting preferential treatment not accorded to other employees. He has no such right under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.225" offset="17792293">He has no such right under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.113" offset="17803786">In Michigan Civil Rights Act and this was raised today, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, a constitutional body in the State of Michigan treated this case as far back as 1966 and said that an employer has the right to establish a normal work weekend foreseeable overtime in its labor agreement and absent an intent to discriminate there was no right of accommodation and there were no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.975" offset="17895320">I submit to you that the same result should be pertain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.655" offset="17914023">I’d like to touch on one other aspect as far as Congress is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.947" offset="17931160">There are a number of exceptions in this Act and no one with the exception of the Sixth Circuit would pay much attention to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.966" offset="17967208">The exception to which I refer and is one that I start out with and I think it exemplifies again what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.448" offset="17997197">703 (a) specifies that it is not an unfair labor practice for an employer to apply different terms and conditions of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system provided that differences are not resolved with an intention discriminate because of race, color, religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.026" offset="18067519">The questions in the Senate debate are very revealing and they ask at the time and they said at the time that the intent of the Act was that it shouldn’t conflict with the rights of seniority nor with collective bargaining contract which are based on bona fide seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.115" offset="18123839">And in the Senate, the question was asked, “Well, what if a Negro were the last man hired in your plant and you came to a layoff situation and the seniority provision says, the junior man will be laid off first as historically it does, that maybe a classification of seniority, it maybe plant wide seniority and what if it says the junior man is to be laid off and this Negro is the last man in?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.557" offset="18229582">Then the answer in the debates, there would be no discrimination on that theory that the low man on the totem pole or the junior man goes first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.853" offset="18258735">In the Reynolds overtime situation, the application is based on a seniority clause negotiated years ago based on classification of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.240" offset="18292381">You get your seniority when you go to the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.928" offset="18303039">No one chooses, picks or does otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.132" offset="18311920">You get it when you go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.034" offset="18319548">There can be no question as to the bona fides of that classification of the seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.641" offset="18337938">So, the assignment of overtime is tied to a neutral policy, so that thus there arises differences in terms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.519" offset="18377435">I work on Sunday, you don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.679" offset="18386108">You work on Sunday, I don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.769" offset="18394467">This is allowed under the Act and as far as I'm concerned the Congress said this is an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.166" offset="18420067">I want to touch on one other point and this was alluded to I believe by Mr. Justice White and by Mr. Justice Stewart at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.111" offset="18455803">Two things, the prohibition against discrimination according to the EEOC includes an obligation to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.194" offset="18500106">The Civil Rights Act is expressed in term of prohibition meaning that an employer should not differentiate between employees on the basis of religion, I'll restrict myself to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.272" offset="18544410">The concept of accommodation has no basis in the statute and in effect is a form of discrimination itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.184" offset="18576071">Accommodation in its simplest form means, to adjust, to help, to do a favor for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.885" offset="18606895">The Civil Rights Act permits the EEOC to interpret the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.255" offset="18628420">The Civil Rights Act doesn’t permit the EEOC to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.065" offset="18647646">The Sixth Circuit on page 32 or our brief said that the requirement of accommodation is not consistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.214" offset="18676276">The Stemple case from California which was refused certiorari by this Court, although on a constitutional question because the relationship is the Government to an employee, also takes the position that accommodation is not necessary under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.555" offset="18741582">The Houston Greyhound case on page 33 of our brief, a decision of the highest court in the State of New York holds that as to accommodation one not need making accommodation to particularization which could assume many variations in appearance and in time schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.165" offset="18804067">And not only is their apparent, as far as we are concerned, that accommodation constitutes legislation not interpretation here, but to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, I think that authorizing of accommodation by the EEOC or compelling employees to accommodate raises a question of whether you are not into the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.102" offset="18899780">In Shepp, you held that the Government must be neutral with respect to religious matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.532" offset="18921514">In Gillette versus the United States, this term, you said that as a general rule the Establishment Clause prohibits the Government from departing secular purposes in order to put in it premature on one religion or on religion as such or to favor the adherence of any sect or religious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.901" offset="18994970">By issuing guidelines the EEOC, by issuing guidelines in which religious beliefs are to be accommodated, the Government find itself putting it in premature on religion as such and this seems to us a violation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.989" offset="19051290">If the Government has a general rule as without power to support or favor any religion, it is submitted that the effect on this case is that EEOC is in fact favoring religion through its guidelines and such action could well be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.154" offset="19103953">This question was raised in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.104" offset="19123806">Another step and this was raised also by you gentlemen especially I think by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.014" offset="19147421">If accommodation is required, I suggest that the guidelines exempt Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.703" offset="19186186">Section 713 (b) provides a guideline upon which one is, this is a Congressional Act of a Civil Rights Act, if you are on conformity with the guideline, if you rely on the guideline it’s a bar to actions or proceedings under this Act, the first guideline and the guideline that should be applied in this case is the 1966 guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.943" offset="19267166">Employee Dewey was disciplined and subsequently discharged in August and September of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.613" offset="19289840">The 1966 guideline set forth for the first time the principle of accommodation as being included within the ambit of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.017" offset="19319411">But look what that guideline said at 1605.1 (a) (3), it said, “However, the commission believes that an employer is free under Title VII to establish a normal work week generally applicable to all employees, notwithstanding that such schedule may operate with uniformity in its effect may not operate with uniformity in its effect upon the religious observances of one’s employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.772" offset="19422438">This is the 1966 guideline. Reynolds established a normal work week generally applicable to all employees long prior to the discharge of Dewey, long prior to the effect of date the Civil Rights Act and long prior to the effect of date of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.297" offset="19480534">When the guidelines came out in June 1966, Reynolds looked at those guidelines knew that they were, if you’ll excuse the expression, “on the money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.703" offset="19518151">They were squarely in agreement with those guidelines with the exception that’s written into the 1966 guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.953" offset="19539153">That guidelines sets forth the impact, it sets forth the uniformity of application theory and specifies that regardless of the impact if you have a uniform application, you are free, you have a bar to this action and I submit to this Court that this case should have been taken care of by the EEOC years ago under it's own guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.800" offset="19634552">I recognize that the guideline was changed in 1967, a year later, but the law as written by Congress, if anybody is interested in it and I know you gentlemen are, but the question that the law is written it says this guideline or any guideline, if you are in conformity with it, if you rely on it under those circumstances it will be a bar to any action for discrimination even if the guideline is subsequently changed by judicial fiat, by administrated decree, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.082" offset="19763702">Again, look at the 1966 guideline, it says, here are some illustrations, what do you mean by accommodation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.654" offset="19794004">It says we authorized the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.890" offset="19802885">The employer should be authorized to prescribe the normal work week and foreseeable overtime requirements and absent any intent to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.554" offset="19833605">An employee who knows or has reason to believe that the requirements of his employment will conflict with his religious beliefs is not entitled to request an accommodation of his religious needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.681" offset="19874147">We negotiated our Compulsory Work Clause in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.541" offset="19889507">Mr. Dewey attained and we have no question he attained his religious scruple in 1961 for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.073" offset="19923675">When he did, he had knowledge of our Compulsory Work Clause and under the guideline, he knew that our schedules had presented him with the problem and whether you like it or not and whether we like it or not, the EEOC at that time said that as far as they’re concerned, in such a situation you don’t have a right to request an accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.465" offset="20021269">And then you go another step, what’s the accommodation in the guideline? The accommodation in the guideline is time off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.842" offset="20050735">That’s what it reads and I submit to you that’s what we have done as far as time off is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.693" offset="20074141">We have reasonably accommodated, if there’s an accommodation obligation and the further question that's raised by the petitioner and by the Government is, “Look, when you get down to basics, why don’t you take the step and get the substitute?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.746" offset="20142373">Our answer is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.974" offset="20151254">“In 1960, prior to ’60, we couldn’t work overtime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.110" offset="20167764">We negotiated -- we negotiated the Compulsory Overtime Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.429" offset="20193050">We worked hard for that and in 1965, it was renegotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.062" offset="20219591">It has subsequently been renegotiated beyond this -- beyond the confines of this record in the seven-week strike and suit, partly on that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.048" offset="20259610">Disregard that if you will, but it's hard one, this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.142" offset="20275911">Now, under those circumstances, you get the substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.015" offset="20295450">If we get the substitute, three things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.620" offset="20309870">We fear, one and we went in to this a little bit, Mr. Justice Blackmun, at that point, one if we get Dewey’s substitute, obviously, we have to get all religious -- substitutes for all religious people who request.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.969" offset="20367235">Now, the second step is what holds you to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.913" offset="20386983">In other words, if you accept as to one element in your organization there are no and hand holds or bars to accepting to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.507" offset="20429406">The Government says at a particular point in its brief as does petitioner, that in that situation, what you should do is you should accept as to the religious people and impress the other people, make the nonreligious people work because the Civil Rights Act takes precedence over the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.680" offset="20514043">I submit to you that what we’re doing, what they are suggesting that we do we will be back here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.758" offset="20538389">God willing, in approximately two or three years under a situation where what we then are doing is making people work who have no religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.002" offset="20583424">Whatever their beliefs are, we must say there are no religious beliefs and under that circumstance, the religious people are free and those without religion or impressed into work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.205" offset="20620204">I think that’s a discrimination of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.111" offset="20635773">I think we’re making our decision basically on religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.833" offset="20646745">This is just what the Act says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.536" offset="20653537">I think this is intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.703" offset="20662209">I also think it's a violation of Title VII and it is also a violation of our labor contract because you -- such a situation would be making us go back up the ladder and skip those seniority people who had a religious exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.844" offset="20718738">And under these circumstances we’ll not only have grievances, we will have arbitration, if we accept as to religion, I would if I were on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.620" offset="20753847">If I were an employee and I I’m with UAW, I would probe us through arbitration to determine the extent of the waiver of the exception that we’re doing and we submit to you that if we were forced to get the substitute, these results come about, we will be back as the biblical expression is, “our last days will be worse than our first.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.090" offset="20839737">In other words, we will back to pre-1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.527" offset="20853530">We will not be able to work overtime to meet our demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.808" offset="20866591">We will be possibly faced with the Title VII violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.361" offset="20884773">We will also be faced with the violation of our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.121" offset="20903894">So, under those circumstances, I think if you want to talk in terms the 1966 guideline, that certainly is a serious inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.176" offset="20936077">If you want to talk about the 1967 guideline, that’s undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.531" offset="20973484">I would say that on the -- as far as we are concerned, that we have not violated the contract under any -- the Civil Rights Act under any interpretation of the law and I would like to touch upon the election of remedies briefly and in that area, the two general theories that have evolved are the theories they were posed to you today, the Sixth Circuit saying that claims that when you have an employee obtains an adjudication in arbitration, he should not be permitted to proceed on the same claim because you impose upon an employer multiple legal actions on the same claim and you can lead to an erosion of arbitration as a final remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.305" offset="21168567">The second theory is phrased in terms of Hutchings and Bowe in terms of the rights and remedies under arbitration and under Title VII are separate and I mentioned this briefly but I wish you’d bear with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.777" offset="21222484">In the grievance that was presented, in the arbitration or a grievance part of the contract, it was said that it was a clear case of discrimination on the part of the company in applying its policy to a petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.226" offset="21268250">In the process of arbitration in which petitioner was represented by the international rep of the UAW, and I might add, notwithstanding Gideon and its ramifications, I think that in arbitration and in those areas that the international reps have most unions are as skilled, if not more so, than many lawyers and do a better job because this is their bread and butter vis-à-vis the lawyer who doesn’t specialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.336" offset="21368665">But I say that in that situation, the union suggested in that arbitration that the effect of the application of the labor agreement resulted in discrimination against its employees who seek to be excused from assigned work for reasons of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.236" offset="21428328">Now, the arbitrator found the employee could not refuse to work on Sunday because of the wording of the labor contract and the employer’s consistent administration as to all employees of the relevant provisions of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.913" offset="21482977">I submit to you that the argument, that the rights under arbitration are different from the rights under the law or under the statute doesn’t stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.020" offset="21535431">They are the same in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.437" offset="21545148">Again, the distinguishing factor according to the Fifth Circuit, the remedies are different and I said before in this case the remedy, what is the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.932" offset="21575137">The remedy in arbitration is reinstatement of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.753" offset="21586422">What is the remedy under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.122" offset="21599901">It's reinstatement on back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.041" offset="21607528">Someone would add, yes, but you can get in injunction under Title VII in the statutory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.249" offset="21632397">I say you can get a prior decision of an arbitrator or a decision of an arbitrator which acts as precedent, so that I submit that under circumstances, the better judicial principle would be that enunciated by the Sixth Circuit and the District Court in California to the effect that you may pursue both remedies as long as you will, but when you get a decision in one then the issue becomes moot in the other forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.743" offset="21730304">It would appear that this approach to the question would also be sound administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.429" offset="21749112">Speaking in that concurrent jurisdiction, it brings waste, confusion, forum shopping and what appears to be an unnecessary series of litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.681" offset="21786102">And I have given away part of my argument in the sense that I think that as far as arbitration is concerned and Mr. Justice Black discussed the finality of the arbitration, I think that we are in serious difficulty as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.139" offset="21851930">And I recognize Lincoln Mills and Boys Market and Steelworkers Trilogy and everything that this Court is said and it can be undone if you allow a concurrent jurisdiction theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.762" offset="21902399">And then, I write into my arbitration, I write into my grievance, you violated my seniority provisions because you didn’t follow the wording in the contract and also I'm 49 because of age and you say this is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.914" offset="21975019">What it's got to do with age?</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.736" offset="21982333">Don’t use age, use religion, use color, use sex and I say under those circumstances, this is what is coming in this situation that you then have two bites of the apple in every situation and unlike the National Labor Relations Act, the matrix of the Civil Rights Act is interwoven into the labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.525" offset="22089435">Everything you do in the labor contract takes all the condition that you cover involved in the working conditions cover the prescriptions of the Civil Rights Act, so that as far as I'm concerned, the election of remedies theory should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.224" offset="22152234">I read -- Arguelles is very interesting and the problem that was raised there and I think this problem that is raised here is much more significant than the problem with all due respect to Arguelles because of the impact that you’re going to suffer, that we are going to suffer are arbitration as a final process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.191" offset="22232168">So under these circumstances, I would conclude by saying that it is submitted that the Civil Rights Act -- under the Civil Rights Act management should have the right to establish working schedules including overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.108" offset="22287757">The working schedules in this case were applied on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.674" offset="22314088">An employee has the duty to observe these work schedules that are so established and for the religious beliefs of an employee don’t entitle of individual to special or peculiar privileges denied to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.468" offset="22361213">From a practical point of view, you gentlemen are faced and the enormous problems don’t balk you, they don’t bother you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.568" offset="22397680">I'm a lawyer from a Midwestern State and I am overwhelmed at some of these problems, but I won’t oppose the problem that faces you eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.716" offset="22430281">According to the 1962 Yearbook of American Churches which is the nearest year that I can take to the Dewey discharge in 1965, there were 259 religious bodies reporting membership in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.469" offset="22485243">They had a membership at that point of 114 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.599" offset="22501752">The work force of the United States today amounts to 70 million employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.806" offset="22522546">As to religious observances of various days I selected four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.772" offset="22550444">I chose Catholic because I am and I wanted to see what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.185" offset="22564133">There are 52 Sundays and 13 holidays, holy days or total of 65 particular days where we could wear this accommodation may work in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.805" offset="22602585">The Jewish religion has 52 Saturdays and 30 other holy days for a total of 82 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.198" offset="22624214">The Greek Orthodox has 52 Sundays and 10 other holy days for a total of 62 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.344" offset="22644799">The Seventh Day Adventist as best that I can see have 52 Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.287" offset="22660472">The total of these four religions alone amounts to approximately 261 days upon which the employees under the EEOC accommodation theory might ask for accommodation in terms of time off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.260" offset="22712404">The problem of scheduling, the problem of extra manpower, the problems of administration which are difficult in ordinary situations become a great deal more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.155" offset="22752005">Such an analysis brings in to perspective the statement of the California Court of Appeals in the Stemple matter where they said “the proliferation of religions with an infinite variety of tenets would if the state is required as an employer to accommodate each employee's particular scruple place an intolerable burden upon the state and accommodation was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.898" offset="22846986">It is submitted that the EEOC approach also places an intolerable burden upon the private employers of America if the Court should accept the EEOC version of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.291" offset="22892544">We submit that it is not only intolerable; it is illegal under our Constitution and under our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.065" offset="22915636">Thank you, gentlemen.</text>
