            <text syncTime="169.859" offset="782817">The principle constitutional and statutory provisions involve the Fourth Amendment and Sections 482 and 1582 of Title 19 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.059" offset="839659">There are set forth in the government’s brief at pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.469" offset="861288">The facts upon which this appeal is based are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.583" offset="881664">On Sunday, August 18, 1968, Sandra Denise Johnson and a female traveling companion, one Jolene Harris, crossed the Mexican-American border on foot at San Ysidro, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.331" offset="948746">Inspector McCown, who at that time had 27 years experience as a customs inspector at that port of entry, San Ysidro, observed Ms. Johnson and her companion and questioned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.367" offset="1008828">He thereupon became suspicious that they were carrying contraband, so he arranged for a personal search to be conducted by a female inspector so that their clothes could be thoroughly searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.594" offset="1061700">This type of search is frequently referred to as a strip search.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.870" offset="1082807">The search in this case was conducted by Mrs. Netta Lohman.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.811" offset="1102660">She searched each of the women separately in a secondary search room which was a completely closed private room with no windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.551" offset="1157622">Each of the women was asked to please remove all of her clothing and hand them to Mrs. Lohman.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.136" offset="1191894">Mrs. Lohman’s search of the respondent’s clothing disclosed two bundles in the seat of her underpants.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.987" offset="1219271">One bundle contained two ounces of heroine, the other Librium and unidentified capsules.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.808" offset="1246647">No contraband was found in Ms. Harris’ clothes and the women’s bodies were neither searched nor touched.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.460" offset="1285204">In the District Court, a motion to suppress the evidence was made on behalf of the defendant Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.444" offset="1313102">Defense counsel agreed with the District Court that the defendant had the burden of proving the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.727" offset="1342255">The defendant did not produce any witnesses or other evidence in support of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.751" offset="1366392">At the hearing, the government attorney called Inspectors McCown and Lohman as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.799" offset="1394604">Inspector McCown testified that after he saw and talked with the defendant and her traveling companion, he became suspicious and arranged for them to be personally searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.869" offset="1450820">He was not asked and he did not state any other reasons as to why he became suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.957" offset="1479241">Mrs. Lohman testified as to the method and conditions of the search and what it revealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.566" offset="1545592">Defense counsel cross-examined Mrs. Lohman but did not cross-examine Inspector McCown, stating by way of explanation that the government had to prove something more than mere suspicion, and he said “he wasn’t about to put his foot into it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.029" offset="1631483">Defense counsel, in essence, argued that a strip search was invalid under the Fourth Amendment in the absence of an affirmative showing of objective grounds for reason-- for real suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.528" offset="1697520">The government attorney relied on the Ninth Circuit’s case of Witt v. United States where a strip search reveal narcotics concealed in the defendant’s brassier and was upheld on that basis, on a basis that mere suspicion was enough to justify such a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.015" offset="1775470">The Trial Court denied the motion to suppress and rejected the defense claim that it was the government’ burden to establish, on a motion to suppress, reasons for Inspector McCown’s suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.773" offset="1838477">The case was tried without a jury on a basis of the testimony of the two inspectors in certain stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.672" offset="1870033">The Court found for the defendant-- found for the-- found the defendant guilty, and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Trial Court’s ruling on a motion was erroneous in the light of that Court’s, that’s the Ninth Circuit’s court decision in United States v. Guadalupe-Garza.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.656" offset="1954043">And, although the Guadalupe-Garza case involved a cavity as opposed to a strip search, the Ninth Circuit did define for the first time in that opinion the requirements “real suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.072" offset="2015692">”The Court said that a strip search cannot be conducted on mere suspicion that something more was necessary and there’s a merit to real suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.712" offset="2054248">It defined the term “real suspicion” as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.177" offset="2072116">Real suspicion, justifying the initiation of a strip search, is subjective suspicion supported by objective articulable facts which reasonably lead an experienced prudent customs officer to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border is concealing something on his body for the purpose of transporting it into the United States contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.840" offset="2194683">The Court of Appeals held that the search in the instant case did not meet this standard since the government did not prove that there were objective articulable facts to support the inspector’s suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.561" offset="2253615">The dissenting judge was of the view that Garza was distinguishable since it dealt with cavity-- with a cavity search which required a more stringent standard than a simple inspection of clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.615" offset="2321847">In his view, the case was on “all fours” with Witt v. United States which had approved a personal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.489" offset="2361344">Parenthetically, the Garza case was decided on February 2, 1970 which was more than 9 months after the District Court had decided the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.066" offset="2419649">We believe that the Court of Appeals should be reversed for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.868" offset="2454862">First, the statutory authority for a customs inspector to conduct a personal search on a basis of suspicion is clear and unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.267" offset="2508466">Second, the great public need to stop the huge inflow of contraband, particularly narcotics, into this country demands that the balancing of the governmental interest in inspection against the traveler’s interest in minimizing inconvenience 7and embarrassment be resolved in favor of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.370" offset="2616822">And, third, that the Ninth Circuit’s objective articulable facts test is an impractical and unworkable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.575" offset="2665723">Now, the statute in question, 19 USC 482 clearly states that a customs officer may search any person on whom he shall suspect there is contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.159" offset="2736044">Congress used a simple word, “suspect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="662.211" offset="2752240">They did not qualify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.140" offset="2759973">They did not use real suspicion, actual suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.974" offset="2775228">There is every reason to believe that Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.870" offset="2790902">Simply, that a person-- that a personal search may be conducted solely on suspicion and if they want-- meant otherwise, we think they would’ve stated because, in this statute, this very statute, 482, they set up two different standards of suspicion, one, suspicion that we’ve been talking about with respect to the person, and then another standard that relates to trunks or envelops.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.193" offset="2908139">In that statute, it says that a customs inspector may search any trunk or envelop wherever found in which he may have a reasonable cause to suspect there is merchandise which was imported contrary to law, which means that the Congress was well-aware of the words that it was using.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.848" offset="2998732">Now, this statute is a very old one, over 150 years in age.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.584" offset="3025690">It dates back to 1815 when it was first enacted and, at that time, they had the mere suspicion test in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.622" offset="3061844">In fact, it was an extension of an even older statute going back to the first Congress of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.617" offset="7753853">Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court, I have had an extremely difficult last few moments in beginning my argument because I’ve heard some of the inquiries presented by this honorable Court to my opponent, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.443" offset="7841102">And, rather than reply directly to any of the petitioner’s argument, I think I have elected and will do and proceed to what I believe to be the gravamen of this case, I believe to be the critical issue here, it’s been raised by Your Honorable Court already this morning, and go on to some concluding remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.491" offset="7945383">First and foremost, when Congress enacted the laws, border search law on vessels and travelers, it cannot be imagined they had in those days even a remote thought that a party coming into this country might be made naked at a port of entry so their body could even be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.094" offset="8035767">When the government here in frames the issue that the reason a person is told to get nude is to look at their clothing, that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.013" offset="8067427">That is incidental to their remaining naked in a room, as appears in the government’s brief, perhaps 15 minutes while the custom inspector looks over these clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.298" offset="8108596">In this day and age, when every travel agency, when every port, when every hotel suggest that our country travel, when travel is permitted to even the poor and the modest people for a day in Canada or a trip shopping in Nogales, Arizona or, as is correct, San Ysidro, California, it cannot be in the reasonable expectation of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.201" offset="8204204">It cannot be understandable to the public in terms that they can know that, by crossing this border, upon returning to this country or as an associate in the offices coming home, they’ll be told on the mere suspicion of an officer “all be it 27 years or 1 year to go into a private room and remove your clothing--</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.615" offset="8501791">One, in balancing the interest, as Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, mentioned this morning, the search of the briefcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.239" offset="8524361">In this day and age, when there are things to be concerned with, it’s a minor intrusion that I open my attaché case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.319" offset="8552678">It’s a minor intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.999" offset="8559365">In the Courts of Los Angeles, it’s the same intrusion and, to enjoy the practice of my profession, I will submit to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.539" offset="8585488">But, to balance coming back into the country after a day to be told to get naked, I don’t think is a fair analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.718" offset="8614222">The privacy that Your Honor refers to in a doctor’s office cannot be equated, and I might add there are many people in this day and age that may not be considered puritanical that do object to removing all of their clothing in a doctor’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.909" offset="8670960">Teenagers, for example, even old women who had their first illness don’t like to get naked at a doctor’s office, but is that anticipated upon coming back to the country that one stranger, a customs officer, all be it experience, has that power on an encode, hunch, or a guess, as Mr. Justice Marshall mentioned this morning, what is it?</text>
