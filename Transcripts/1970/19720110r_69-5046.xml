            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">We will hear arguments next in number 5046 Apodaca against Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.405" offset="105535">Mr. Sobol, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="30.444" offset="121731">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.555" offset="134165">In 1968, this Court decided Duncan against Louisiana in which it held for the first time that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is applicable to criminal trials of State Court by virtue of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.030" offset="200098">A month later in DeStefano against Woods, the Court held that the holding in Duncan would only be applied to cases tried after the date of the decision in Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.682" offset="238655">After Duncan, the three petitioners in these cases were tried in Circuit Courts of Oregon for serious crimes and each of them were convicted by a split verdict under the procedure authorized by the Oregon constitution of allowing a criminal verdict with 10 out of 12 juries concurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.775" offset="311066">The votes in the respective cases were 11:1 and two of them in 10:2 in the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.564" offset="342204">The jury in each of these three cases was out of the Courtroom in the jury room for less than an hour in one case for less than a half an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.835" offset="375327">The convictions were appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals raising the argument that the Sixth Amendment rights annunciated by Duncan had been violated by the acceptance of a split jury verdict and the Court of Appeals of Oregon following a very recent decision of the Supreme Court of Oregon affirmed the convictions and held that the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to a unanimous Jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.914" offset="467592">The Supreme Court of Oregon refused review of the cases and the cases that here on certiorari to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.830" offset="507298">The question therefore, which is presented in light of Duncan and DeStefano against Woods, is whether the Sixth Amendment permits a conviction for serious crime without a unanimous jury verdict and I would like, to in light of the arguments made with the State of Oregon, define that question even further and that is where there is no state procedure for minimum periods of deliberation, which is the case here, whether the Sixth Amendment permits a conviction of a serious crime without a unanimous jury verdict.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="155.357" offset="621401">In your view would a minimum period for deliberation make a difference, Mr. Sobol?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="159.633" stopTime="311.843">
            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="159.633" offset="638433">I think it would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.109" offset="644389">My personal view on it was that, it would still not be satisfactory but the reference in the State's brief to the English system on the proposal of the American Bar Association are systems and proposals which as part of them secure a minimum period of deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.259" offset="708963">The draftsmen in both those cases recognize what we think is a very important value lost by the Oregon system of requiring jury deliberation and I think when and if that case ever gets here, the Court would have different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.919" offset="759641">If another provision is made to ensure deliberation, whether or not that insurance is satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.377" offset="785450">Now in 1970, in Williams against Florida, the Court passed on the question of the six man juries in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.229" offset="808856">And the Court held that although there had been a six manned jury historically at common law and although the Court in past have indicated that the Sixth Amendment does in fact require, I am sorry there had been a twelve man jury at common law and although the Court, this Court had indicated in the past, the twelve Juries are required under the Sixth Amendment and reconsidering the question, the Court made a two-step analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.532" offset="886073">First, it said that the history of the constitution, the history of the Sixth Amendment left the question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.063" offset="908225">That it was impossible to tell from the historical materials what the draftsman of the Sixth Amendment meant on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.379" offset="933512">And Mr. Justice White for the Court said, the way we are going to determine which feature of Jury trial right at common law is incorporated in the Sixth Amendment is to determine whether the feature in question serves an important purpose in terms of the functioning of the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.936" offset="991713">It is a practical test to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.853" offset="999340">Applying that test, the Court held twelve men are not required and specifically left open with the question of whether a unanimous jury verdict is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.851" offset="1031314">Now, we are arguing this case squarely within the holding and the test annunciated in Williams, and we think the application of this test resolves the case in our favor, because the requirement of a unanimous jury verdict serves four very important purposes in terms of the basic function of the jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.820" offset="1107278">Those four purposes are, it ensures that the jury enters into meaningful deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.413" offset="1129639">We think it serves an important purpose in maintaining the reasonable doubts stated in criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.606" offset="1150328">We think it maintains an important purpose in giving meaning and effect to this Court's decision, requiring it of a cross section of the community jury decisions and we think it serves an important function in terms of community.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.110" offset="1204349">We respect in confidence in the processes of the criminal law and in convictions for the secured criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.190" offset="1228696">And I would like to discuss each of these four functions to indicate their breadth.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.843" offset="1247295">Mr. Sobol, as you do so, those are good arguments for a policy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.191" offset="1268715">Will you emphasize the constitutional aspect sought from as you go along.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="321.293" stopTime="397.223">
            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="321.293" offset="1285120">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.659" offset="1290553">They are constitutional in this sense, interpreting the Sixth Amendment in Williams against Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.717" offset="1310824">This Court said that the way to resolve the constitutional and to the issue of constitutional interpretation in the Sixth Amendment, what does jury mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.364" offset="1341440">It means something and the Court said in terms of deciding what it means, we are going to look to it, the functional importance of the requisite of a jury trial on issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.830" offset="1379265">That was the Sixth Amendment test enunciated by Mr. Justice White for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.430" offset="1393685">We are simply taking that test and arguing this case that unlike any fixed number of juries, the requirement of unanimity is a concept which serves very important functions and therefore meets the constitutional test enunciated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.457" offset="1453767">In 1896, Allen against United States, this Court said the very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by comparison of use and by arguments among jurors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.296" offset="1509146">The unanimity requirement is the aspect of the jury trial system which ensures that the jurors will go into the jury room and exchange views.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.081" offset="1556271">The work that has been jogged down in the jury area by Kalven and Zeisel indicate that in States such as Oregon and Louisiana, the two States that have split verdicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.530" offset="1650103">I think in Allen, the Court was talking about the jury system constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.289" offset="1669120">It was a case having to do with a choice of the jury trial and did not raise this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.019" offset="1684062">I am just indicating that in Allen, the Court was referring to the operation of the system and what was important functional.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="428.376" stopTime="438.970">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="428.376" offset="1713424">Well, the Court was certainly aware then as we all are now that when the Sixth Amendment was proposed, it was proposed to have the unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.010" offset="1748010">Was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="438.970" stopTime="585.371">
            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="438.970" offset="1755847">There was an amendment in the house to include unanimity as the specific requirement of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.969" offset="1787820">That Amendment was unsuccessful in analyzing that exact Amendment in Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.478" offset="1809868">The Court said that it is not possible to determine whether the unanimity requirement, along with the other aspects of that Amendment was stricken because everybody knew the jury trial meant unanimity or because the Congress did not wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.797" offset="1863158">And in approaching this case Your Honor, we have simply accepted the very recent interpretation of that very legislative history in Williams and accepted that conclusion that it is 6 of one half dozen that the other, it is impossible to determine from that with legislative history what exactly the framers had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.372" offset="1941420">I would point out that the major controversy concerning that amendment did not have to do in any respect with the requirement of unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.058" offset="1976216">The main argument about the Amendment was a proposal to put vicinage in the Sixth Amendment, to require that a specific district as a common law be incorporated in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.838" offset="2019265">The debate was about that point as the journals of the constitution reflected so on in our brief and that the Amendment was deleted with respect to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.602" offset="2054374">The whole of Amendment was deleted but that the controversy, that the congress was focusing on was the vicinage requirement which was not a desired to be included and with that, the entire subsection was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.986" offset="2107873">Analyzing that as I said in Williams, the Court said you really cannot tell what the Congress meant in its drafting and that again, the question has to be decided in terms of whether the issue, the requisite is functional in terms of the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.436" offset="2173701">Now, the unanimity requirement means that the jury cannot come out of the jury room until everybody agrees, and because everybody has to agree, the process means that everyone sits out at the table and hears the views of all the juries and this is important because, the idea of having more than one juror is that different jurors are going to see the questions differently and are going to have different perceptions of the evidence and the reason that a jury verdict is a fine a thing as it is that if everybody’s view of the evidence, everybody’s interpretation has been merged, has been handed out, has been considered by everybody, so that when the jury comes out of the jury box in the jury room and announces its verdict, you have a collective judgement which is considering the views of everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.371" offset="2341407">Justice Blackmun suggested, is not that the policy argument that led to, was either four or six of the States of the original 13, to insist upon a unanimous verdict provision written into the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.035" offset="2448091">Its intrinsic meaning means unanimity that the jury system does not function as we know it without unanimity and Mr. Justice White in Williams said that is the question the Court must ask when it is up for consideration, whether a particular feature is included in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.647" offset="2522488">I am simply taking up that test and saying that without deliberation, you do not have a jury as we know it in this country that the -- as the court said, the very object of a system is to secure unanimity by a comparison abuse and by an arguments among jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.771" offset="2623007">I think that there are, as the Courts recognized innumerably are the case like In re Winship comes to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.031" offset="2652056">There are certain interests at stake in a criminal trial by which the society has historically wanted to be very careful about erroneous convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.385" offset="2693538">The risk of error in terms of a criminal conviction has historically been thought in this country to be a much more serious matter than the risk of error in a civil case that enumerable procedures have been established in criminal cases to lessen the risk of error in fact finding which is always present.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.106" offset="2764382">Now, I think the absence of unanimity certainly increases the risk of error and the risk of an erroneous conviction and I think that the consideration, the stakes in civil cases are very, are different and a very important spec.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.531" offset="2910041">But I do, very firmly want to indicate to the Court that I think that is a very different case and I do not think Oregon can defend its procedure in this Court by saying well, in England; there is a minimum period deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.737" offset="2966883">A minimum period deliberation is undoubtedly a step toward retaining this feature of the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.493" offset="2989871">In States like Oregon, when the jury goes into the jury room and takes its first vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.264" offset="3289025">Now, I realize that is a big assumption and the jury convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.652" offset="3374602">Which would have deliberated and which would have reached a verdict and I think the first jury would not be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.194" offset="3392679">In my view, if there was a 24-man jury together and 22 voted.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.927" offset="3439700">That is why you have more than one jury, more than one juror because people see things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.120" offset="3460389">That is one of the basic human lessons and you want to give what everybody has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.582" offset="3474286">That is what a jury system is and I think if you were to exclude that in the process and in the jury room, I would make the same argument regardless of the number.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.429" offset="3557669">A lot depends on the luck of the draw, but once it is drawn, the system is to hear what everybody has to say before a vote in written at the very least and I say more than that to work it out so if you do have a unanimous collective judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.510" offset="3617959">Now, my second contention with respect to what the function of unanimity is, has to do with reasonable doubt as the Court knows in Winship, it indicated the reasonable doubt stands as constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.826" offset="3663203">Now, reasonable doubt was developed in the context of a unanimous jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.367" offset="3681384">What it means that a prosecutor has to convince every juror to convict this man and specifically what that means is the juror with the highest standard, the most doubting juror must be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.544" offset="3730077">I think it is beyond argument that when you say the prosecutor needs to only convince less than all the juries, that he needs – that a lesser burden of proof is being put on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.752" offset="3766962">The convictions on less evidence, conviction without convincing all the people are being allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.441" offset="3789740">More evidence would have secured all the juries vote but with less evidence, ten or nine in Louisiana is being allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.884" offset="3819520">The most difficult jurors to convince need not be convinced and therefore, I think it is plain that the standard of proof in criminal trials is being lessened by a rule, which allows a majority verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.482" offset="3877825">Now, just very briefly on the figures, Kalven and Zeisel study have revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.711" offset="3906769">Across the country, 5.6 of the juries hang.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.436" offset="3917740">5.6% of juries hang and Oregon, 3.1% of the juries hang.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.358" offset="3937384">What that means is approximately 2 and 1/2 % of all the criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.607" offset="3950341">You get a verdict in Oregon where you would not get a verdict elsewhere and we think those are the hardest cases obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.179" offset="3976673">The cases that would have otherwise hang up.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.033" offset="3984091">The cases that have the greatest doubt associated with them and it is those cases in which Oregon is permitting criminal convictions where other states do not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.654" offset="4122540">But what Kalven and Zeisel does say and has determined from their empirical data is when a jury is hung 10:2 or 11:1 at the end of the process of deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.395" offset="4161515">That reflects greater dissent at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.356" offset="4173322">That where the first vote is 11:1 or 10:2, the jury will not hang, but it is where that there is 8:4, 9:3 and a process of deliberation succeeds only in wheedling down that number to two or one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.268" offset="4225045">That the jury would not hang and their conclusion is that those are the very cases in which they is substantial doubt or the jury cannot resolve the doubt and those are the cases whether historical judgement is that the jury should be hanged up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.052" offset="4268199">Perhaps on retrial, there would be different evidence, more evidence, less evidence that might result in a judgment one way or the other but at the trial which is being held, there is doubt which cannot be resolved and those are the cases which historically have resulted in hang juries with the option of the State to retry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.578" offset="7326302">I am here to defend majority verdict system as a good system rather than to argue for advantage because what it does here it facilitates the end object of trials that is a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.253" offset="7380950">One way or the other, there is no particular statistic or advantage for the prosecution and in fact the slight statistical advantage to the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.705" offset="7690762">We do generally retry cases in Oregon but I cannot speak to retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.427" offset="7717616">Furthermore I have pointed out just since we are talking statistics that we read, that we convict some 85% of the defendants in Oregon County that go to trial, 94% altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.621" offset="7762442">So when speak about 80-20 break of hung juries where guilt or acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.912" offset="7783549">Even there the defendant would enjoy slighter advantage from the County in which I may incorporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.251" offset="7808940">We feel that is a good system 10:2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.307" offset="7817195">I am not arguing for 9:3 one way or the other but the ALI as I say agreed with that and their recommendation of 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.818" offset="7847184">The English agreed with that proposition in 1967 when they switched to such a system and the American Bar Association project on minimum standards agree with that as a suitable formal procedure for the United States in its report of 1968 and even Kalven and Zeisel whose common carry is not always on our side of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.650" offset="7942583">He grudgingly admitted in their law review article in their speech advising the English that justice in Oregon has not broken down the Court but then also nobody has ever claimed that Oregon justice is superior to justice elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.521" offset="8010083">Kalven and Zeisel so state, the constitution does not require that our justice be superior to elsewhere of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.389" offset="8037460">We find that it does sort the guilty from the not guilty and it does it in a fair manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.880" offset="8059507">It does so accurately and it does so efficiently and I think that all three of those qualities are essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.973" offset="8087824">We invalidate the Oregon system of course and this Court must find that in his offensive either to the very wording of the Sixth Amendment or it is offensive in the sense which counsel suggests that the phrase jury trial precludes a majority verdict system and we argue that neither is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.058" offset="8176222">It is not violative of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.527" offset="8186044">I wish to point out that I -- counsel pointed out in there too in my brief and I wish to acknowledge it with my regrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.045" offset="8212167">I start discussing Article 3 Section 2 and the constitutional debates thereon quoting from the (Inaudible) and I transpose the word in my note, civil to criminal in my brief at page 19 which I regret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.344" offset="8265352">At the constitutional convention in Oregon about civil cases only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.607" offset="8286354">When the Congress met to submit the Sixth Amendment however as counsel acknowledged there, there was specific reference to criminal cases, specific reference to unanimous jury verdicts and James Madison’s original formulation, which I would read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.103" offset="8368379">Reads the trial of all crimes ellipse shall be by an impartial jury of the free holders of the vicinage with the requisite of unanimity for conviction of the right of challenge and other custom requisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.238" offset="8420937">That was passed, not formed by the house, sent to the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.600" offset="8434312">There in the Senate, various of the clauses including the unanimity clause were stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.806" offset="8463151">The diarist to the Senate was ill that day and so we do not have a record of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.283" offset="8481123">It was sent back to the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.627" offset="8486452">There was a motion in the House to restore most of that wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.332" offset="8505260">The motion in the House failed on an even vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.768" offset="8523024">So unanimity was stricken from the Sixth Amendment and this Court in order to decide with the petitioner would essentially have to reinsert the language which the Congress struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.893" offset="8571507">As to whether or not under Williams versus Florida and Duncan versus Louisiana, the phrase jury trial and in and of itself requires unanimity, I think not because it is functionally silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.332" offset="8641306">The function of jury as used in that phrase, and define in Duncan and Williams, is that, it was to serve an interposition, an interpositional safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.356" offset="8689371">Interposition of the common sense of the citizens as a shield against an oppressive Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.418" offset="8725629">It was a safeguard inserted between citizen and crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.814" offset="8743184">It stemmed from the distrust of the Courts, which existed at that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.040" offset="8760111">It stemmed also I might add there was considerable distrust from lawyers and also prosecutors but originally the crime was the -- of course, the agent requirement were thought to be oppressive and that was uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.068" offset="8824268">The unanimity is not necessary to perform the function of safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.549" offset="8846106">Surely, for example, if there were a jury of 24 and we allowed a verdict to 23 to 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.904" offset="8883513">23 out of 24, that sort of a system would safeguard, the citizen from an oppressive Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.788" offset="8911099">It would interposition citizen's judgment at least equally effectively and a narrow requirement that six citizens sit in judgment of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.010" offset="8956029">The function according to those cases and I am sure correctly so is the substitution of citizen judgment for official judgment and a verdict of 10:2 does just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.302" offset="9009110">I might point out that for other high crimes and treason, the constitution allows the fact finder to decide by three quarters and I speak specifically of the impeachment proceeding wherein at that time, 18 to 26 vote was sufficient to find the president or a judge guilty as I recall the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.262" offset="9089045">High crimes, and treason and impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.091" offset="9168353">It must be more than a mere of majority, it would seem but I say that as a subjective judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.900" offset="9227598">7:5 is barely a 1:1 ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.317" offset="9237211">It is only slightly more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.453" offset="9245780">9:3 is quite another matter somewhere, there is I think simply a judgmental determination to be made and I think that 10:2 at least in my experience has worked out satisfactorily in Oregon without public clamor to the contrary and it is an agreement with as I indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.352" offset="9857358">There is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.841" offset="9863314">There is not and I think wisely not because unanimity is more desirable as the number is reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.446" offset="9897691">Because we are talking about a safeguard function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.713" offset="9906782">If the juries were composed of 40 men and obviously unanimity would not be as important as it is, if it is composed of six men because we are talking about a substantial barrier between Government and citizen and six unanimous will perform it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.406" offset="9973551">Ten agreed beyond reasonable doubt will perform that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.562" offset="10010227">I wish to say also that in that case, unanimity is often compelled and by that I mean 12 people are seldom unanimous in any view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.363" offset="10049411">We tend to be contentious and that is particularly true as we have broadened the representation in the jury and the law has many devices to make for unanimity where truly, there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.219" offset="10096849">We do not anymore, as they did at common law, freeze or starve the jurors or cart them from a size to a size until they decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.096" offset="10128300">What we do, allow our judges to comment on the evidence and according to Kalven and Ziesel’s review of a 101 cases where the judge did comment on the evidence, only one jury failed to agree with the judge and that failed only by an 11:1 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.139" offset="10196532">So that is a powerful weapon to compel unanimity or influence unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.432" offset="10217639">The Allen charge pushes a jury to unanimity often not; I would not say that, in Oregon at the time of the original argument, our Supreme Court had not ruled on the Allen charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.755" offset="10278975">Since then, our Supreme Court has disallowed the Allen charge in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.900" offset="10295589">We do not allow our judges to comment on the evidence but that is what those devices are for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.088" offset="10316278">We do not happen to employ those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.128" offset="10324428">There are structural devices within the criminal law, which are designed largely to encourage compromise and if not designed for it, although that is a principle of code revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.884" offset="10371448">If not designed for it that is there effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.141" offset="10380539">Graves of crimes, we have those in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.975" offset="10395899">Jury set penalties or such devices to encourage compromise rather than really the vote of conviction and this Court authorized that last May.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.262" offset="10445009">Even in a single non-bifurcated proceeding like McGartha versus California and Crampton versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.585" offset="10470296">We do not have those devices in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.426" offset="10481685">We do have attended to a verdict, which I think reflects much more accurately the feelings of those jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.334" offset="10509270">The last two that come over and the last one that came over most likely for a speculative recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.446" offset="10533721">Because of all sorts of pressures and all sort of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.317" offset="10557231">But I think that a 10:2 verdict has certainly the same degree of integrity behind it and has certainly the same strength as a safeguard between citizen and Government, as does to a verdict where there is a judges commentary on the evidence which means evaluation of it and in Allen charge and a compromise regarding penalty, none of which we allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.029" offset="10676036">And I might add, it does it first time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.331" offset="10689306">It has a positive value in the administration of justice and I think that is important today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.925" offset="10707696">The ACLU amicus brief refered to the savings and mistrials as being a trifling economy; it is much more than a trifling economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.809" offset="10755135">And actually, there is a picture congestion in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.757" offset="10766942">In Oregon, we believe that justice need not be harsh but it should be swift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.976" offset="10787840">Kalven and Zeisel States there are 5.6% mistrials in unanimous States 3.1% is all for mistrials in Oregon and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.898" offset="10835592">I do not know what the break down would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.409" offset="10845623">A difference of 2.5% but the difference in other words of 81% if we were to switch to the unanimous system, it would increase our mistrial by 81%, we have managed in (Inaudible) county to get trial down to within 60 days of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.373" offset="10913437">We have gotten the appellate process down in the last two and a half years, for 18 months to four and a half months and we have done it by examining each article of criminal procedure to try and better the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.447" offset="10969757">We do not need an 81% increase in mistrials and I think that we do more –</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.845" offset="11219278">That maybe 12 jurors, 6 jurors while one judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.932" offset="11235683">Or ten out of twelve jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.104" offset="11252402">The doubt of one juror is not reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.670" offset="11266612">Else wise is a hang jury would be a finding of reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.536" offset="11282077">That would be upheld as an acquittal and this Court authorize retrials in such situations back in 1902 and to carry his argument, (Inaudible) demonstrate that the beyond reasonable doubt argument is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.229" offset="11336829">We could say by extending his argument that a rule allowing a seven-man verdict for a preponderance of the evidence a nine-man verdict for clear and convincing the evidence and a 12-man verdict for beyond reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.457" offset="11393776">It could be with a logical outcome of an argument, which tends to be the standard of proof to the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.174" offset="11416660">It does not; those are not relevant considerations, burden of proof or burden of persuasion in examining that majority verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.741" offset="11462949">Regarding the requirement of meaningful deliberation, there are cases in which deliberation will be meaningful and I suspect that there are cases today in which deliberation is not meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.474" offset="11517806">For example, the one where they decide 12-0 one-way or another at the very beginning on the initial vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.483" offset="11553855">There are however less banned constitutional solutions to accomplish that particular goal if the Court deems it desirably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.655" offset="11598576">That is I think of the minimum deliberation time as in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.199" offset="11620728">Which, we do not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.122" offset="11628460">Certainly, that seems to me rather an instinct device and probably a very good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.261" offset="11644970">And I might add incidentally that there is a directive of Court as is the practice in England wherein the Trial Courts are directed not to instruct the juries even regarding the possibility of a majority verdict until they have deliberated for two hours and reported back which is an interesting device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.571" offset="11718217">The point I wish to make however is, that it is not something, which is constitutional proportional, which must be dealt with by carving something new into the grant of constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.393" offset="11761476">There is no need for, it can be dealt with simpler remedies if there is an indication somewhere that there is less than meaningful deliberation and you never know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.789" offset="11819154">I tried a murder case ones, which moved trying up with a second-degree verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.594" offset="11834305">10:2, and found out afterwards that the two holdouts were for first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.257" offset="11856980">One really never knows even exactly what the verdict means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.767" offset="11875056">Regarding the cross section of the community, that is a problem of the panel rather than being specific, not rather than a specific jury has been pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.316" offset="11921241">Swain versus Alabama and the allowance of the peremptory strike system demonstrates the difficulties of translating that down to the specific jury, that tries a case but in any rate, in Williams, it says that less than twelve men, six men are sufficient to bring out of such a sampling, a fair sampling into the jury room is sufficient to place a body of citizenry between crown and citizen, which is the purpose of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.543" offset="12058122">I do not think that the demand for cross section means that anyone -- it means that all should participate, it does mean that all should participate not necessarily that each should have veto or each should be able to prohibit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.210" offset="12120816">The goal of trial unlike some of the insertions of defendants brief is Swain, it seems to me always to be verdict and not a mistrial and a demand for mistrials is really demand for veto not for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.617" offset="12182465">If minority members are in fact excluded, and I have a chance to answer questions, which were asked to me last March.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.013" offset="12207961">It is rare that a lawyer can give the answer, after he sits down but anyway, if members are arbitrarily excluded from the deliberations of a case, it seems to me that is not, the likely kind of abuse that you would assume, juries will commit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.542" offset="12338155">There is a motion for new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.395" offset="12353515">And in Oregon, we provide all the Due Process counsel, transcripts, and etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.795" offset="12379115">There is a Federal habeas corpus, as a remedy where such a matter occurs, Parker versus Gladden as you may recall out of Oregon and not two years ago, such an example where the bailiff sent to the jury, that wicked fellow, he was surely guilty of words to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.666" offset="12454661">We did not eliminate bailiffs as a result of such an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.164" offset="12476604">We kept bailiffs but we do provide the after the fact remedy in that case for the habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.126" offset="12504503">So, regarding public confidence, it is significant that the requirement of unanimity is an historical accident and really nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.605" offset="12546403">I will not repeat which has been set out in brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.426" offset="12561659">It is an historical accident, it just occurred and we have it when people have grown accustomed to it and I would expect that lawyers from jurisdiction are accustomed to unanimity, have a hard time adjusting to some other system mentally, their initial response is barely negative although we have grown very comfortable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.321" offset="12633234">But non-unanimity on the other hand when we talk of public confidence was specifically voted in by the people of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.951" offset="12667716">When they amended the constitution and so when we speak of public confidence, we must remember that this came from the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.070" offset="12692271">The public did decide and it does not simply lawyers have self appointed withered aims of public opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.047" offset="12724140">This was a public measure and there is no ground as well I can report of opinions, and it is trying to change here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.049" offset="12752144">We are undergoing procedural revision at this very time and there is no movement within that body to change it because it works and I think that is the last point that I wish to reemphasize, it does work, it was accurately fairly expeditiously and it did in these cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="3217.176" offset="12868650">Thank you very much, here are my comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.672" offset="12874606">I would like to make a few very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.019" offset="12887980">Firstly, I think perhaps the Court has been stuck as I was during the argument of the inappropriateness of making innumerable constitutional decisions as to whether six out of eight or 10 out of 12 or 9 out of 12, where in Montana 8 out of 12 or odd -- are acceptable under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.750" offset="12966975">I think that is not a proper constitutional role for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.406" offset="12977528">I think there must be a more objective test to be applied than just juggling all these numbers, particularly in light of Williams where we know at least that the number can range from six to twelve and the combinations are very large and I think the Court ought to take note of the fact that what is getting into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.008" offset="13052029">If it starts making innumerable determinations as to which combinations are enough and which are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.980" offset="13079824">Secondly, the exclusion of minority is not an abuse as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out by his questions, that if there is a 10:2 vote and the minority is not firm, the verdicts will turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.971" offset="13115873">That is not an abusive matter that can be later corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.387" offset="13125486">That is the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.922" offset="13131651">And to argue, it can later be corrected, it misses the point that that is exactly what is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.002" offset="13155997">Thirdly, I would like to point out that the Kalven and Zeisel without going to far into that 80:20 rate cannot be said to be a rate in favor of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.989" offset="13203853">Perhaps that is against those trial that result of an outcome but I think the important point is that when the jury would otherwise hang.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.328" offset="13229244">The result in some four to five cases of conviction, now that is not a benefit to the defendant, that is the detriment to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.602" offset="13250351">What if the consequences are of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.090" offset="13256307">I think that point should be clear that more -- that four or fifths of those cases, there is going to be a conviction and lastly, I would like to just note that the citation which is not in our brief to the constitutional history which makes very clear that the deletion of the Amendment of the Sixth Amendment having to do with unanimity concerns vicinage and not unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.339" offset="13337287">It is in volume 5 of the documentary history of the Constitution of the Untied States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.088" offset="13352333">Pages 205, 206, and 210-11 in which Madison’s letters make clear what the debate was about and was not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.929" offset="13379709">And of course, the Ninth Amendment was enacted expressly to secure that simply because a right was not expressly set forth in the bill of rights, it would not be read to have been intended not to be secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.015" offset="13427984">I thank the Court very much.</text>
