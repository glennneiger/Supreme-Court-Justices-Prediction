            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">The case on for argument this morning is Mackey against the United States, number 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.585" offset="133726">Mr. Ward, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="12.360" offset="152848">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.180" offset="168103">This matter comes before you this morning in a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.681" offset="194121">It was commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Hammond Division within approximately two weeks of this Court's decisions in the Marchetti-Grosso cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.660" offset="241977">The petition was brought under 28 U.S.C 2255 by Mr. Mackey requesting a new trial from a conviction of willful evasion of income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.248" offset="292342">The gravamen of the petition was that during the course of the income tax evasion trial, the Government had admitted into evidence 60 wagering tax returns which under the Marchetti-Grosso decisions were, of course, taken from the defendants in violation of its privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.022" offset="383457">The petition was pending for approximately eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.405" offset="401011">No answer was filed by the Government, and in order the court required an answer to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.588" offset="417729">Briefs were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.272" offset="424417">In August of 1968, the District Court denied the petition for relief under 2255 and a PO followed to the United States, Court of Appeals which affirmed and petition for certiorari was granted on August 29,.1969 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.680" offset="490141">The facts insofar as they bear upon this appeal in the evasion case are as follows; Mr. Mackey was indicted for willful evasion of taxes for the years 1955 - 56 through 1960 inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.181" offset="556074">The trial and the theory of the Government in the evasion case was a pure net worth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.198" offset="576136">In other words, there were no specific items of unreported income shown by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.319" offset="600691">This type of case has been given the imprimatur by this Court in the Holland and Friedberg decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.490" offset="629321">During the course of this trial, the Government’s offered into evidence 60 wagering tax returns which had been filed by Mr. Mackey monthly during the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.165" offset="676028">At the time that these returns were offered in evidence, the District Court trying the case decided that they were prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.467" offset="733288">Objection was made to their admission on the grounds that they would be prejudicial that Mr. Mackey was not on trial for being a gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.433" offset="761083">The court withheld admitting the exhibits into evidence until the future time, when offered again upon the submission by the Government that these were needed to show the gross income from gambling during the years in question, they were then admitted by the court below. At the close of the Government’s case, Mr. Mackey moved for acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.301" offset="872573">He was denied. Mr. Mackey then rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.248" offset="884381">The case was given at the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.761" offset="890441">The jury then considered the case for approximately 43 hours over a period of five days, but in a judgment of conviction which was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and petition for a writ of certiorari, there too was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.013" offset="951463">This case offers, we think two major issues to the court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.441" offset="973093">They are Willis decisions and Marchetti-Grosso be retroactively applied to criminal cases which were tried and finalized prior to the date of these decisions and secondly and I think personally more importantly what is the thrust to the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.445" offset="1057102">Is it a transactional privilege or is it a testimonial privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.723" offset="1074239">And does the privilege as specifically written into the Fifth Amendment mean exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.381" offset="1100884">Now, as far as the retroactivity part of this case is concerned, I even question the accuracy of the word retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.522" offset="1145501">Marchetti-Grosso where decisions of this Court which I feel righted a wrong in the Kahriger and Lewis decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.673" offset="1178102">Marchetti-Grosso did not break any new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.258" offset="1192417">Marchetti-Grosso said and I think reaffirmed and reaffirmed as it should have reaffirmed that the Government, the National Government, the same as the State Government has no part to compel testimony or compel evidence out of the mouth of the citizen if the purpose of this compulsion is to provide evidence to be used against him criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.038" offset="1283532">This Court I think Universally and constantly has held in any retroactivity case before it, relative to state matters that where the element of compulsion is present, where statements or where confessions are taken from a defendant through compulsion and used against him in a criminal proceeding at any time, he may thereafter move for a new trial or take whatever steps are necessary to afford him a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.342" offset="1412786">I think what’s before the Court this morning is this, is the standard which this Court has imposed upon the states to be imposed upon the National Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.548" offset="1453537">And quite frankly upon this Court, I think if this matter would have arisen in the state or in the State Court or relative to state legislation, I don’t think there’d be any problems in the court saying that once you find compulsion and if I may use one of Mr. Justice Stewart’s phrases in dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.267" offset="1532426">Compulsion is the focus of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.869" offset="1542875">Once you find compulsion, once you find a compelled statement being use against a person in a criminal trial, then retroactivity or a new trial automatically follows.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="370.065" offset="1583626">Would you clarify it for me here, just what compulsion are you referring to?</text>
            <text syncTime="375.655" offset="1605987">Compulsion on whom to produce what consequence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_ward" startTime="379.035" stopTime="392.791">
            <label>Mr. William M. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="379.035" offset="1619466">If Mr. Mackey had not filed these returns, he could have been indicted for failure to file a return and could have been sentenced to the penitentiary for five years and could have been fined $1,000.00 for each offense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="392.791" stopTime="395.804">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="392.791" offset="1674533">It’s true of all of us, isn’t it, if we don’t file tax returns?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_ward" startTime="395.804" stopTime="454.915">
            <label>Mr. William M. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="395.804" offset="1686549">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.985" offset="1691355">That is correct and that’s the difference actually between the Sullivan case and between this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.131" offset="1707865">In the Sullivan case, this Court specifically held that a return which was required from all of the people and for the purposes of raising revenue, certainly was not sheltered by the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.107" offset="1759796">Justice Holmes, then however suggested that if any particular part of that return, any particular question in that return would tend to violate the privilege and of course the privilege could be claimed in the return, the difference is in the Marchetti-Grosso situation at least as I read the two decisions and as the lower courts who seem to following it as I suggest them to read decisions, the court held specifically that these returns were not required from a general class of people for general Governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.688" offset="1878079">I think this Court held specifically that these returns were required from gamblers in order to provide evidence to prosecute gamblers.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.026" offset="1915486">That I think is the gravamen of the case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="454.915" offset="1923009">I know this is going over old ground perhaps, but it might help me.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.376" offset="1948923">What about an application for passport, statement and an application for a passport?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.449" offset="1969194">No one is required to apply for passport, but in order to get a passport, you must file an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.048" offset="1999600">Would you think that the statements made in the application for passport, for example, or anyone of many other similar optional areas would be sheltered by the same -- protected by the same shield of the Fifth Amendment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_ward" startTime="490.317" stopTime="548.545">
            <label>Mr. William M. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="490.317" offset="2064593">In the first instance, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.560" offset="2073579">If the law requiring the passport or if the law requiring the filing of some other hypothetical document is directed towards the populist or the citizens at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.212" offset="2120182">For a illegitimate Government purpose, in other words, there’s no filing at the purpose of this legislation was specifically to obtain evidence to be used against a narrow class of people in criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.669" offset="2162082">But if it were as passport’s law are directed to the public at large, certainly I think you would be required to file an application for a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.931" offset="2199071">Now, if there were something in that passport application which may tend to incriminate you, then I think yes, you have probably a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.112" offset="2231777">You got the problem of whether in asking for a passport, the Government can either compel you to waive your privilege against the self-incrimination or make the claiming of the privilege costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.308" offset="2284648">And I think on that basis, you might have to take it on a case-by-case basis.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="548.545" offset="2297501">And then what about the applications for Government employment which requires many, many answers and that is accompanied by a statute making it a felony, to give a false answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.995" offset="2619329">I think as a practical matter anytime you file a false document with any agency of the Federal Government, you got a felony staring in the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.898" offset="2654960">But to the extent going back to your employment provision, to the extent that an employment application again is a document which is directed at all people, which is directed towards everyone, you don’t -- at the threshold meet the problem that you meet in Marchetti-Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.859" offset="2726849">This would not be per se a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.786" offset="2742523">To the extent that anything was in there, any question or answer was required which may incriminate you, then you get into this question of, do you have a right to federal employment and can they compel you to waive the privilege and again, you may have a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.171" offset="2796022">I don’t profess to be able to specifically answer, but you may have a problem on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.215" offset="2816188">But I think this Marchetti-Grosso situation goes one step further because we have a specific, direct finding by this Court that the statutes themselves where aimed at a small class of people for the purposes of getting information to prosecute the small class of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.600" offset="2901765">I think that is settled by Marchetti-Grosso and I think the lower courts have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.264" offset="2920469">For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Nucio case, vacated a conviction upon a plea guilty on the grounds that protecting integrity the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.981" offset="2967280">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has done the same thing last month.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.883" offset="2986924">They have held Marchetti-Grosso retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.854" offset="2998836">They have held that the harmless error rule doesn’t apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.043" offset="3011584">They attempted to distinguish the Mackey case, but they also have had held that to protect the integrity, the privilege against self-incrimination prosecutions under the statute and land and the basic thrust of it is the rational of Marchetti-Grosso has found in those decisions from this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="780.766" offset="3226415">Precisely, and if this Court is held both in Friedberg and Holland that this is an absolute necessity in such a case because they are purely totally, solely circumstantial evidence cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.890" offset="3270928">Now, the prosecutor then went onto say, he needed it for another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.121" offset="3287855">He needed those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.444" offset="3297155">He had to show that those figures -- he had to get those figures into evidence and right after these returns are put into evidence, Mr. Harrington then testified from one of his graphs, exhibit 765 showing the total gross receipts from gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.554" offset="3349608">Now the reason that those total -- that the prosecutor said he needed those total gross receipts from gambling to show that he had a greater income from gambling, than shown in his schedule C-returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.192" offset="3400182">In other words, in evidence in this case was schedule C returns a showed income from “policy” and I think one returns had policy wheel, the man paid his income tax and his wagering income.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.802" offset="3450546">But the Government argued I have got to show that he had a greater income from gambling than showed on schedule C. So I not only need those wagering tax returns to show that he was a gambler, I need him for the figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.870" offset="3502895">And so he argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.874" offset="3510836">He so argued to the jury on four different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.056" offset="3519613">I think this is -- as far as the importance of these returns are concerned with the Government, I think the prosecutor summing up argument is almost the key here.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.838" offset="3550751">This was a long trial and all net worth trials are long trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.850" offset="3566738">I think they were over 800 exhibits, pieces of paper put into the evidence in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.863" offset="3586800">The reason being is because the key testimony in a net worth trial is the Government’s expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.714" offset="3614177">He has the expert exhibit and of course the foundation has to be laid to support everything in the exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.931" offset="3639045">In spite of the fact that there were 800 exhibits or an excess of 800 exhibits and that they key exhibit in the net worth case is the file net worth summary by the prosecutor, that was mentioned to the jury six times and rightfully so you’d expect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.483" offset="3701321">The next amount of time as far as any exhibit was mentioned to the jury was these wagering tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.951" offset="3727130">Four different times, the prosecutor came back to these wagering tax returns and one of them in effect was very interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.872" offset="3754820">It was almost a Griffin type case and these are said out in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.244" offset="3772374">He said to the jury if these wagering tax returns are accurate, if they truly reflect the ins and the outs, then they’re okay, but there is only one man that can tell us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.606" offset="4489801">But again, as to the weight given to that and the argument to the jury, the prosecutor never argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.726" offset="4690317">And I think that to me is practically decisive as far as how important these returns were to the Government on a trial, the District Judge in these proceedings considered them extremely important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.865" offset="5414849">Four times he went back to those, four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.253" offset="5424358">I think they were extremely important to the prosecutor and being extremely important to the prosecutor, they were important -- he fought something like two weeks to get these into evidence and even the judge at an evidentiary objection, at an evidentiary objection said they were somewhat inflammatory, didn’t want to leave them in, and then decided to leave them in, not so much into the issue of gambling but they contained figures that the Government said was absolutely necessary to their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.108" offset="5531773">The Gross income figure is just the gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.209" offset="5544208">Now, if they weren't important, then the O’Connell case would have taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.416" offset="5557060">There was a specific ruling in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals that returns that characterized the man a gambler if not relevant to the case with prejudicial and reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.610" offset="5593840">So I just don’t think the Government can have it two ways to have one point convince the judge at the trial level that these are relevant and extremely important and must go in and then on the appellant level hearsay, they weren’t very important, they weren’t very relevant and we didn’t really need them because if that were the case, this case should have been reversed the first time around on the issue of Ricardo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.380" offset="5692897">Then we get into the nature of the privilege itself, the transactional testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.813" offset="5710660">The Government is argued that because Marchetti-Grosso specifically talked about gamblers, but this is not a gambling prosecution and therefore, the thrust of the decision should not go to this type of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.063" offset="5775653">I think the privilege itself, no person in a criminal prosecution should be a witness against themselves answers the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.695" offset="5818180">I think once the privilege is violated and this Court has specifically ruled that the privilege was violated in the Marchetti-Grosso situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.392" offset="5848900">Once the privilege is violated, that taints the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.784" offset="5866559">I can’t conceive of it being in use of another prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.218" offset="5876276">I can’t conceive of this Court holding or stating that the privilege against self-incrimination can be violated and there are some circumstances in which the evidence could be used in a criminal prosecution against the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.326" offset="5936671">To me in any event is the beginning and the end of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.580" offset="5961644">If you go back to the Silverthorne Lumber case, this Court held that the essence of a provision which prohibits the acquisition of evidence is not only that the evidence not be used in court, but that it not be used at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.908" offset="6015039">You get into the Murphy v the Waterfront Commission state, a silver platter sort of a thing where the Court held that if evidence be taken on the state level in violation of a witnesses's privilege against self-incrimination, it may not be used in any manner, in any manner, these are the words of this Court in a criminal prosecution by the Federal Government against the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.212" offset="6108244">The Gardner case reaffirmed, just I think a year or two ago, reaffirmed the Murphy v Waterfront Commission in that situation and I would like to spend a second with the Gardner case because I think it has some relevance to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.035" offset="6155473">The Gardner case was a police officer who lost his job because he refused to surrender his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.677" offset="6182118">He wouldn’t sign a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.566" offset="6189641">A year and a half later, this Court decided the Garrity v. New Jersey case said they couldn’t do that to him, couldn’t make the imposition of the penalty costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.110" offset="6227780">He then filed a petition for reinstatement for his job which was denied and the case worked itself up and that this Court ultimately decided that he should get his job back but his privilege was a violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.778" offset="6282533">In other words, in a civil manner, this Court had no problem with making Garrity retroactive to a set of facts that happened a year and a half before where a man had lost his property, his job if you will because of a violations privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.782" offset="6338539">It just seems to me in a criminal manner, in a criminal case where a man has been convicted in a very important link of the chain of evidence needed to convict is a part of the conviction process that he has a right to a new trial on the same basis that Garrity or Gardner had the right to his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.683" offset="6426102">So as far as this Court I think persistently and continuously held that once the privilege has been violated that the evidence cannot be used in any manner against the witnessed, it is always held, at least I read the case as far as state prosecutions are concerned, and it is always been extremely careful and talking in particularly in retroactivity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.376" offset="6512828">In talking for example, that the Miranda Rule should be prospectively applied, the Escobedo Rule should be prospectively apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.942" offset="6539160">It always been extremely careful to iterate and reiterate and continue to carve out this exception that where it a shown that a statement is taken from a witness involuntarily and used against him, then he still has the right at anytime to avail himself at any state or federal machinery for bringing this to the attention of the Court and getting the appropriate relief which is exactly what we have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.899" offset="6650964">I believe, I still have four minutes Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.412" offset="6660995">I like to save them if I may.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="1693.284" offset="6876557">Well, he started out with assets of roughly $360,000.00 and according to the Government's computation had over a million and a half dollars of assets at the end of the prosecution years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.528" offset="6925458">But in terms of taxable income that he reported a $143,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.995" offset="6955342">The principal issue at the trial did not have to do with gambling, the issue was whether the Government was justified in including in petitioner’s networth, certain assets which petitioner’s acquired in the names of corporations which he controlled, in the names of friends, relatives and even a fictitious persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.441" offset="7041128">It was a long trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.065" offset="7047607">More than 80 witnesses testified and the bulk of the testimony showed that petitioner had furnished the funds for the purchase of assets consisting of securities, real estate, loans and mortgages paying for these assets either in currency or with cashier’s checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.667" offset="7130049">The largest transaction and which is typical except for the dollars involved related to petitioners acquisition of stock in a fire insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.785" offset="7166516">He first paid $50,000.00 in currency with instructions that the stock be issued in the name of one of the corporations which he control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.603" offset="7201834">Later, he paid an additional $98,000.00 in currency for the purchase of additional shares in the name of the second company that he controlled, and still later, he paid $15,000.00 in currency for additional shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.523" offset="7261497">Well, this was the largest investment he made during the prosecution years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.101" offset="7279783">The Government’s proof showed that on literally dozens of occasions, he purchased assets using cash or cashier’s checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.518" offset="7321475">The largest of the companies which petitioner controlled was the Gibraltar Industrial Life Insurance Company of which he was Chairman of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.758" offset="7366405">Petitioner’s basic contention at the trial in this case was that the assets he purchased and in most instances had registered in the name of Gibraltar actually with the property of Gibraltar and therefore could not be included in his net worth, but the income tax returns that Gibraltar filed showed that the corporation operated at a loss during the prosecution years and did not have sufficient capital to acquire the assets which petitioner paid for during those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.498" offset="7493360">Petitioner’s sister was Gibraltar’s treasurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.556" offset="7509556">She testified on direct examination by the Government at Gibraltar’s books and records reflected all receipts of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.793" offset="7546546">On cross examination by defense counsel, she changed her testimony and explained that not all receipts had been recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.970" offset="7583222">Additional cash was available to Gibraltar she said because insurance premiums paid in cash by policy holders were not taxable and therefore where not recorded, while this might explain why the receipts were not included on Gibraltar’s income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.580" offset="7657723">It could not explain the absence of a showing of these receipts on the books and records of Gibraltar and on the reports which Gibraltar was required to file annually with the department of insurance of the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.586" offset="7717700">And in this connection, I’d like stress one point that while the investment which petitioner said belonged to Gibraltar but which were unrecorded on its books and records were paid for either in currency or cashier’s checks, that corporation’s expenses were with rare exception paid for by regular bank check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.267" offset="7808397">This then in brief compass was the Government’s proof that petitioner's net worth has increased during the prosecution years by substantially more than can be accounted for by the taxable income reported on his returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.716" offset="7870255">In addition, it was the Government’s obligation under the net worth method to show a likely source of additional taxable income that could account for the net worth increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.001" offset="7911424">To this end the Government introduced into evidence, petitioner's income tax returns for 1956 to 1960, which show that certain of his income came from being a “policy operator” and in one instance from a “policy wheel”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.485" offset="7993344">I’d like to correct one factual statement that Mr. Ward made and that was that defense counsel did not object to the introduction into evidence of the schedule C forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.097" offset="8039737">He did object on the grounds of prejudice and the objection was overruled and the income tax returns were admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.280" offset="8084459">A second point omitted from Mr. Ward’s statement was that in addition to the schedule C forms which indicated that petitioner was in the policy business, there was the testimony of an Internal Revenue Service agent that in the course of his investigation, petitioner admitted that he was in the gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.384" offset="8184874">The Government also sought to introduce petitioners wagering tax forms for the 60-month period covered by the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.416" offset="8221027">Defense counsel objected and again this is most important, the objection according to Mr. Ward was based on the ground that the wagering tax forms were prejudicial, but it was also based on the ground that the information disclosed in the forms could be computed by reference to the income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.132" offset="8307858">That is that they showed nothing more than the income tax returns themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.536" offset="8333563">The Government attempted to introduce the wagering tax forms; first, during the course of the testimony of the first witness who had prepared petitioner’s income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.120" offset="8379852">These forms were not mentioned again until more than 60 witnesses had testified regarding petitioner's cash transactions, and this was during the course of testimony of petitioner’s secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.407" offset="8428962">On both occasions, the Court reserved ruling on the ground that the Government had not shown that the forms were not merely cumulative of the information that appeared in the income tax returns, not until the Government’s last witness testified was there further mentioned of the wagering tax forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.562" offset="8509628">Defense counsel again objected to admission of the forms on the ground both that they were prejudicial and cumulative of what was in the income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.097" offset="8551737">Now, the forms which are reproduced in the appendix which is on file with this Court, show have an entry and I am reading form page 41 of the appendix, the gross amount of wagers accepted during the month -- page 41 Mr. Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.520" offset="13685426">Defendant contends however that the wagering tax returns constitute coerce confessions since they were filed under the compulsion of a legal command and that retroactivity follows automatically once the question is so characterized, but the compulsion which turns interrogation into a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination is not the same as the coercion and intimidation which makes a confession involuntary and a denial of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.230" offset="13804335">And at this point, the court cited Davis v. North Carolina which was decided on the same day as Johnson and showed precisely what the court was pointing out but not every self-incrimination case is a coerce confession case and this is not a coerce confession case under any standards that this Court has applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.988" offset="14155316">As far as the second factor reliance, it seems to us clear that the Government could reasonably have relied on Lewis and Kahriger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.976" offset="14203277">They were still on the books when petitioner was tried and Albertson was decided almost two years after the trial ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.934" offset="14235146">In fact, petitioner can’t make too much of an argument regarding reliance because he himself relies on Lewis and Kahriger to avoid the claim of waiver in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.417" offset="14277047">He says he didn’t raise the privilege against self-incrimination because he did not know that he had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.268" offset="14308394">And so there can’t be any serious question about the reliance prong of the three factor test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.804" offset="14330546">Finally, with regard to the burden on the administration of justice, it must be considered if Marchetti-Grosso is held retroactive that collateral attacks maybe brought not only with respect to convictions failing to filed wagering tax forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.636" offset="14397942">Not only with respect to convictions of income tax evasion like petitioner's conviction in which wagering tax forms were introduced into evidence, but also as to convictions under the comprehensive prohibitory scheme both federal and state outlawing gambling and gambling related activities which this Court described in Marchetti-Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.091" offset="14483728">And it seems to us that in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion, one of the reasons that he rejected the restrictions on use test which the Government urged in Marchetti-Grosso was the difficulty that states would have in showing that prosecutions under federal and state law for gambling, that states and the federal Government would have would be -- they could not show that they were untainted because of the filing of the wagering tax forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.657" offset="14605981">Here if this Court holds to Marchetti-Grosso retroactive, that issue will be raised with respect to every conviction for violation of federal and state gambling statutes going all the way back to 1951, in cases in which wagering tax forms were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.615" offset="14681840">We urge therefore that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3720.431" offset="14985070">The problem is we lost the argument and the evidence was admitted against us, and it was used against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.074" offset="15019656">And I think to the effect that it was used against us, I refer the court to page 16 and 17 of our reply with a prosecutor having gotten that evidence in, relied on it, immensely before the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3827.839" offset="15414732">It certainly has nothing to do with the privilege against self-incrimination which is before this Court right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3839.167" offset="15460080">I want to make it strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.397" offset="15464991">The constitution says, the Fifth Amendment says, no person shall be a witness against himself on a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3861.628" offset="15549837">The harmless error in the constitutional rulings, the Harrington and the Chapman situations usually at least as I read them come up on Fourth Amendment situations or confrontation situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.724" offset="15594245">The constitution does not prohibit searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.964" offset="15607202">It prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and the constitution requires confrontation but it doesn’t necessarily, specifically prohibit evidence which would go in, in a trial without confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.471" offset="15665298">These rules have exclusion or judge made rules and I think there can be a further emendation on these of harmless error, but the constitution specifically says, no person shall be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding and Mr. Mackey was a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding.</text>
