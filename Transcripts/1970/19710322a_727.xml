            <text syncTime="35.423" offset="248184">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.072" offset="274725">This case involves the validity of Arizona’s legislative policy which requires a person to be a United States’ citizen or in lieu of United States citizenship, a resident of the United States for 15 years as a condition for obtaining welfare benefits in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.191" offset="363227">There are seven other states that have similar provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.019" offset="386529">Briefly, the facts, the named appellee Carmen Richardson is an alien lawfully admitted to this country under our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.728" offset="433340">She has been a continuous resident of the State of Arizona for 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.679" offset="461134">Mrs. Richardson, prior to the filing of the complaint was eligible for assistance under the aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled Program but for the United States citizenship requirement for in lieu of U.S. citizenship to 15 years to national residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.642" offset="552981">Appellee filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona attacking the constitutionality of the citizenship requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.668" offset="605121">It claimed in (Inaudible) was that the citizenship requirements violated her right to travel and denied her Equal Protection under the law as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.206" offset="667293">She also alleged two statutory grounds; one that the statute violated the Social Security Act; and two, that the statute violated 42 United States Code 2000d.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.937" offset="734166">The District Court after hearing enjoined the appellant from enforcing that United States citizenship requirement as provided by Arizona Law and there after upon motion of the appellant state judgment pending judicial review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.576" offset="848792">We would first like to point out that there has been no invidious discrimination in this case as was found in the case of Shapiro v. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.878" offset="889960">All the state has done in this case is to create two classes for determining who shall be eligible for welfare benefits in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.366" offset="935936">One class is citizens, the other are aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.106" offset="954849">This Court, by prior decisions have allowed states to favor citizens over aliens in their war on poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.616" offset="992883">Specifically we direct the Court’s attention to the case of People v. Crane wherein Justice Cardozo stated “To disqualify aliens as discrimination indeed but not arbitrary discrimination.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael S. Flam</label>
            <text syncTime="240.784" offset="1069578">No it was the decision of the lower court which is affirmed by the United States Court without an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.388" offset="1099985">But his opinion in the lower courts is very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.618" offset="1124958">To disqualify aliens is discrimination indeed but not arbitrary discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.940" offset="1146169">For the principle of exclusion is the restriction of a resources to the state to the advancement and profit of members of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.968" offset="1182323">Ungenerous and unwise, such a discrimination maybe is not for that reason unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.646" offset="1213043">Further, last term this Court decided the case of Dandridge v. Williams, which we feel is very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.076" offset="1246793">In that case, this Court stated in the area of economics and social welfare, the state does not violate Equal Protection merely because the classification made by its laws were imperfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.695" offset="1305203">If the classification has some reasonable basis, it does not offend the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.624" offset="1356925">We submit the state does have a reasonable basis for favoring U.S. citizens over aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.821" offset="1377719">Funds available for welfare purposes in the State of Arizona are quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.913" offset="1398094">For example, a family of four in the State of Arizona draw an ADC, the maximum payment is a $167.00 a month.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.513" offset="3452468">We submit based upon the special stay interest doctrine which has been announced by this Court in previous decisions that the State of Arizona has the right to favor citizens over aliens in its welfare programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.468" offset="3532298">I cannot over emphasized the importance we rely upon in the case of Dandridge v. Williams wherein this Court has stated that the constitution does not empower this Court to second guess state officials charged with the difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds amongst the myriad of potential recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.551" offset="3636684">Appellees rely heavily upon the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.674" offset="3661134">However, they do not show or demonstrate to this Court that that right extends to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.621" offset="3692899">In Shapiro v. Thompson that right was the reason, primary reason why citizens who had to wait one year were deprived of Equal Protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.328" offset="3763743">Assuming arguendo that the right to travel does extend to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.981" offset="3786418">The statutes in question we submit, do not have a chilling effect upon the exercise of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.574" offset="3816720">For one thing, indigency alone severely limits one’s mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.517" offset="3844514">Another fact not to be overlooked is that we’re dealing with a national residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.739" offset="3869383">We do not require an alien to reside in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.839" offset="3889758">The requirement is that you reside in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.384" offset="3915985">Known is our law impede free movement or job opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.982" offset="3942421">The flaw of the appellee's position can be shown by a logical extension of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.267" offset="3983485">If an alien is residing in one state for example, New Mexico and wishes to move to another state, for example my state, Arizona, where Arizona’s welfare benefits are less than New Mexico’s, can he compel the State of Arizona to raise its benefits?I</text>
            <text syncTime="989.707" offset="4065301">think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.653" offset="4077108">If the court accepts the appellees’ position as tenable, that all distinctions affecting aliens and citizens would be suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.568" offset="4128726">Clearly, this has not been the wisdom of the court in the past. Furthermore, Arizona’s citizenship policy is articulated by the Social Security Act which does not forbid states from favoring citizens over aliens in the distribution of welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.488" offset="4232380">This interpretation is bolstered by committee report of the Congress which states, “A state may if it wishes assist only those who are citizens but must not insist on there haven’t been born citizens or on there having been naturalized citizens for a specified period of time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.062" offset="4314718">Further, this has been the view of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, the person charged with the administration of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.019" offset="4366545">The Arizona citizenship requirements, I should point out to the Court affect three federally matched programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.060" offset="4394653">The Old-Age Assistance Program, the program the appellee applied for, aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled and the aid to the Blind Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.179" offset="4431120">There is one state program involved in this case and that’s the General Assistance Program which is solely funded by the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.251" offset="4483469">One more point, that I would like to discuss is the statutory issue of 42, 2000d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.603" offset="4520876">This statute states that no person shall be discriminated because of national origin under a program which is financed by federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.579" offset="4576778">Arizona’s citizenship requirements apply to all aliens, regardless of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.667" offset="4621082">We do not distinguish between Germans or Englishman or Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.813" offset="4641667">And as is pointed out in the case of Lassiter versus North Hampton Board of Elections, a statute does not violate Equal Protection, if it’s applied equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.489" offset="4688374">In that case, North Carolina’s literacy test was upheld for the reason it applied to all races on an equal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.717" offset="4765278">One other point, if a United States citizen, who has not resided in the United States for 15 years, was expatriated and at a later date was allowed into this country, he too would not be eligible for welfare assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.014" offset="4962450">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.398" offset="4988050">I would like to at this time reply very briefly to the reply brief submitted by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.323" offset="5027756">The appellant apparently found that one of the argument raised in the appellee’s brief, the argument that the state law here conflicts with the treaties made by United States, namely the U.N. Charter and the Charter of the OAS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.345" offset="5119812">Since that argument was not raised in the court below, we should not raise it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.809" offset="5141650">In reply to that argument, I would like to point out to this Court that it is a general appellate rule that any decision by a lower court should be affirmed if there’s any basis or ground to affirm that decision even if the affirming of the case would rely on grounds not otherwise raised in a court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.676" offset="5253141">This is different than appellant’s position which is -- you can reverse a case on a basis of a ground which has not been established below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.653" offset="5301102">In other words, the lower court had no opportunity to review that claim and somehow the result would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.805" offset="5329627">And to support my theory, there are two cases decided by this Court, very squarely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.681" offset="5373200">These cases are Helvering versus Gowran in 302 U.S. 238 and Securities and Exchange Commission versus Chenery Corporation 318 U.S. 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.316" offset="5475704">The appellees’ brief raised four different grounds for the affirmance of a decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.692" offset="5521262">I would discuss each of them in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.224" offset="5539338">The first basis for affirming the decision is that the United States Government has on several occasions entered into multilateral treaties with other nations and particularly, the United Nations Charter which governs this country, the same as any other treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.156" offset="5659084">This was the view that was advanced in an earlier case argued before this Court in Rice versus Sioux City, Cemetery case cited in my brief and the court on rehearing has said that that argument was not without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.358" offset="5731913">We know that the United States is a leader of the free world and that everything that we do reflect very seriously on our posture broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.541" offset="5796592">Specifically, if the states are allowed to discriminate against aliens, nationals of other countries who are invited to come to this country and there are immigration powers, it will weaken our posture before the other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.033" offset="5858555">And for this reason, the state should not be allowed to conflict with the national interest and the public policy of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.670" offset="5909128">And more particularly, since it is established that most of the aliens in Arizona are aliens of Mexican origin, we are bound by the treaty called the Charter of the Organization of American States and the OAS charter as cited in my brief, very specifically provided for equal treatment of all persons within the respective jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.901" offset="9798029">Well, Mr. Justice White, I enjoy -- being from an academic community, I enjoy talking about extract principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.652" offset="9829063">I understand and I must emphasize that my answers to these questions has no bearing to this particular case because we’re dealing with the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.267" offset="9863544">We are arguing that a state statute violates the Equal Protection and that prior decision of this Court such as Truax v. Raich, Yick Wo, and the latest case of this Court in Takahashi v. California Fish and Game Commission very clearly show that the states can no longer deny aliens some of the basic necessities of life such as employment, on this case, welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.334" offset="9999799">The cases cited by Mr. Flam, the case of Heim v. McCall which came out the same year, as Truax v. Raich, and also People versus Crane, these are cases decided in another day and age based on the right of privilege to the economy and I do not believe that these cases should be used as authority for this Court today and that these case should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.139" offset="10126963">Further, we have additional arguments including that of the preemption argument that since the Federal Government had provided for immigration nationalization under the foreign commerce power and under the power to regulate immigration and nationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.847" offset="10193836">The states can no more enter the area because it conflicts with the national power and the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.126" offset="10226960">Here we got several cases by this Court, Fong Yue Ting case and the case of Hines versus Davidowitz are in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.626" offset="10276906">Further, we have congressional statutes in point governing the Equal Protection of laws with the Civil Rights Act of 1870 which is now in 42 U.S.C 1981 and that statute was cited with approval in both Truax v. Raich and the Takahashi case as providing for equal treatment of all persons including aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.594" offset="10380769">But that statute is very specific and say that, “All persons within jurisdiction of the United States must be subject to the same laws and the full and equal benefits of all laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.207" offset="10423296">And in addition to that, we have the Civil Rights of 1964 in 42 U.S.C. 2000d.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.309" offset="10455688">So, it's our position that the decision in the lower court can be sustained on any and all grounds raised by our brief and that there are cases squarely in point -- from precedents decided by this Court and that therefore we urge that this Court affirm the decision rendered by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.841" offset="10545758">Are there any more questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.570" offset="10840733">Thank Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.539" offset="10852645">Your Honors, this case comes before you on direct appeal from a decision of a three-judge statutory court convened in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.830" offset="10889738">The decision of which court was rendered on July 13, 1970 and which decision held Section 432 (2) of the Pennsylvania Welfare Code unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.986" offset="10942401">And that in denying general assistance to aliens who are residents of the commonwealth, it violated the precepts of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.442" offset="10980227">The fact to the case Your Honor is relevantly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.934" offset="10994228">The appellee, Elsie Mary Jane Leger immigrated to this country from Scotland on May 18, 1965, and undertook employment for which she remained a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.182" offset="11051175">She applied for general assistance together with her common-law husband shortly prior to December 9, 1969 and she was denied assistance at that time solely on the ground that she was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.676" offset="11105196">She commenced her action in the Federal District Court on December 9, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.137" offset="11127035">The court subsequently permitted amendment of the action to add Mrs. Jervis as a party plaintiff and to permit the action to continue as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.706" offset="11177294">Mrs. Beryl Jervis who is the other party plaintiff to this action immigrated to United States from Panama on March 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.431" offset="11212194">And after working for two years, ceased her employment because of illness and applied for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.034" offset="11242600">She too was denied assistance solely on the basis of our statute which prohibits the dispensing of assistance to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.057" offset="11278649">I perhaps said that wrong, it doesn’t prohibit, it doesn't provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.846" offset="11301846">Presently, there are two assistance programs in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.205" offset="11319296">One of course is the categorical assistance which provides aid to the blind, aid to the aged, aid to the totally and permanently disabled, and aid to families with dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.476" offset="11364331">These are all federally supported categories of assistance from which receive slightly over one half of the funds from the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.718" offset="11405291">Neither of the named parties here would have qualified for any of the federal assistance categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.827" offset="11445729">The other assistance program which we have in Pennsylvania is our so-called General Assistance Program which is wholly state financed and which provides aid for all other persons who are citizens of the United States for whom no aid is provided under the categorical assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.575" offset="11524723">I’m going to be completely frank with this Court as I was with the lower court and state that there is no question for what the statute draws the distinction between citizens and aliens, and if, the special public interest doctrine has been overruled, sub silentio as the lower court found that it was, then I am going to have a very difficult task indeed in justifying the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.047" offset="11638617">However, if the court will bear with me for a few short moments, I should like to discuss just briefly the two cases by which the lower court found that this Court had overruled the special public interest doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.621" offset="11700893">The first of these of course is a Truax case which involved the employment or the failure to employ a person as a cook in the State of Arizona because of the fact that the Arizona Statute provided that employment had to be 80% citizen, just as used in that case however specifically noted that the special public interest doctrine was an exception to the ordinary test of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.915" offset="11818130">He stated, “This discrimination defined by the Act does not pertain to the regulation or distribution of the public domain or of common property resources or the people of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.047" offset="11870584">The enjoinment of which may be limited to citizens as it begins to both, as against both aliens and citizens of other states.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.616" offset="11904857">We of course admit immediately Your Honors that we realize that this doctrine has been somewhat changed by your decision in the Shapiro case, with respect at least to citizens of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.972" offset="11946339">We do submit however that it retains full vitality insofar as its application to aliens is concerned. 32 years later, in the Takahashi case, this Court also said speaking through Mr. Justice Black that the special public interest doctrine was still in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.877" offset="12037977">Although this Court specifically denied the claim that the preservation of fish within its three-mile border was a special public interest to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.970" offset="12082280">One thing, I think however Your Honors is very imported to note in the Takahashi case and that is if I understand the case correctly, the statute there also discriminated among aliens and that those who would have been denied the right to apply for the fishing permit would have been those who weren’t ineligible for citizenship in the United States and therefore, it would have applied only to Orientals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.203" offset="12199205">While the court did not make a great deal of this fact, I do think it is a very important distinction between that case and the case that we are talking about here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.874" offset="13441902">No, the mistake was occasioned by the fact that when the federal statute first come out, our department felt that they were required by that statute to grant assist under the federal categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.528" offset="13484534">That appears in the transcript to the hearing in the lower courts Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.229" offset="13515358">Preview the second phase of the appellee’s argument which of course was a contention which was not important in the lower court’s decision but it was alluded to there and of course is raised again before this Court on appeal and that is the alien’s right to travel for which position the appellees placed great reliance on this Court’s decision in Shapiro versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.123">My understanding of that decision Your Honors is the fact that this Court found that the right of citizens to travel derives from several provisions of the constitution and from the very nature of the union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.544">The court did not, however, according to my understanding of that case, say that the right was derived solely from the Fourteenth Amendment which of course has been conceded applies equally to aliens except for the judicially created exception which we are advancing to this Court at this time which is a special public interest doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.992">We would further point out Your Honors that the right to enter and abide, we feel by virtue of decisions of this Court are not on the same footing as the citizen’s right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.606">The Truax case for example, this Court noted that the alien’s right to enter and abide stemmed from Federal Law and not from the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.144">And such right might therefore be retracted by federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.392">It would seem to follow therefore that an infringement on his right which we would deny as brought about by the statue here in question might be invalid under the Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.329">It might be invalid by the virtue of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.065">But it certainly would not be invalid by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.415">We come therefore to the final issue raised by the brief and that is whether this statute in Pennsylvania is an obstruction of Federal Law dealing with immigration and naturalization or an attempt on the part of the state to regulate aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.175">We concede that under the decision of this Court in Hines versus Davidowitz, the state can only do this within very narrow limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.111">However, as Judge Wood appropriately noted in his dissent in the lower court, if Pennsylvania had no General Assistance Program at all, Federal Laws dealing with aliens would not be obstructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.760">It is therefore difficult to see how Federal Laws are anymore obstructed because the state decides to give welfare payments to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.920">Furthermore, insofar as attempting to regulate aliens is concerned, how can a statute which grants assistance to citizens be said to regulate aliens anymore than a statute which would grant assistance to person over 65 can be said to be regulating persons under 65 and to take it one step further, let us assume that the statute grants assistance to all persons over 65, alien or citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.097">Can an alien then come in and challenge the statute as being discriminatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the Supremacy Clause because it attempts to regulate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.146">We respectfully submit to state that proposition indicates its absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.416">Appellee, in their brief assert that the state's denial of general assistance to aliens may have some effect on the decision of an alien to settle in Pennsylvania or it may cause him to remove elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.152">Of course the same thing might be said of Pennsylvania’s 6% sales tax or its liquor tax which is the second highest in the nation, or its cigarettes tax which is also somewhere near the highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.864">No one we submit, however, Your Honors would seriously contend that these statutes are invalid as an attempt to regulate aliens because they might cause him to remove elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3665.307">The test that they are trying to assert to ask this Court to determine whether or not we are violating the Supremacy Clause in regulating aliens is whether or not this statute does have some effect on their decision to locate elsewhere or not to locate within the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.432">And any of these thing could certainly have an effect on that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.728">We would also submit Your Honors that because of the federal statute and the federal scheme of intent which is indicated by that statute and their requirement that aliens entering this country be able to demonstrate their ability to earn a livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.631">We sincerely doubt that this factor has given much if any consideration at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.284">That is the factor of whether or not Pennsylvania grants assistance to aliens or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.275">And finally Your Honors I would point out and I think it came up in the Arizona argument, the federal statute do not impose any duty on the states to provide assistance to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.869">In fact, even in the federal assistance categories, the statute leaves it open to the states and would not cause the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to hold a state plan invalid where it does discriminate against the aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.287">We would further submit in this regard that the statutory intent and scheme as set forth in the federal statute on immigration and naturalization particularly in 8 U.S.C. 1182 (a) -- 1182-87, 1182-8, 1182-15, 1183 and 1251 would lead one to presume that the congressional intent was to relieve both the states and the Federal Government of the burden of aliens who were or who might become public charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.918">We submit therefore that it’s difficult to see how the state’s decision to grant an affirmant of benefit to citizens of the United States residing in Pennsylvania conflicts with this scheme of federal regulation of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.773">We had an allegation which I think Your Honors that I have to systematically respond to in the brief and that was that this statute according to the appellee’s position was enacted as result of war hysteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.011">I wanted to point out to the court that in the lower court transcript which the court has before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.144">There is only one minute quantity of proof and which was submitted as a one man’s opinion in writing on the scheme of assistance in Pennsylvania which said that this was enacted as a result of war hysteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.803">There is absolutely no legislative history to support that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.640">There is absolutely no other credible evidence to support the charge, except the opinion of the one author.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.996">We submit Your Honors that it is just as logical and more in keeping with the presumption that the legislature has a proper motive in enacting legislation to assume that after the enactment of the Federal Social Security Law in 1935 and after four years of trial and error basis, the states could see a vast area of persons who were not encompassed within the federal statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.393">And they enacted a general assistance statute to take care of these particular persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.092">We would not say that they did not at that time have the special public interest doctrine much in mind when they did not provide for aliens under that same scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.227">In summary therefore Your Honors, we would submit and we will admit that these laws which create distinction between aliens and citizens which have evolved in the formulation of the special public interest rule are based upon the assumption that aliens hold allegiance to foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.751">We respectfully submit, however, that if the court is ready to say that this distinction violates the precepts of the Fourteenth Amendment, we would also submit that this Court may in the very near future be ready to say that denial for the right to vote and the denial of the right to hold public office are also rights which may not be denied to aliens for the same reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="4216.276">We have before us today, a case of alien discrimination which is rooted in the prejudice and ill-will of an early year in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.430">The fact of this was past at a time of war hysteria and anti-alien feelings in Pennsylvania was made clear in a memorandum commission, a study commissioned by the state, by the Welfare Department which is part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.326">In addition, this law which was passed in 1939 was passed within five days of the State's Alien Registration Act which this Court struck down in Hines v. Davidowitz and in a sense, the motivations behind a citizenship requirement not unlike the motivations behind the residency requirement as in Shapiro v. Thompson, both basically rest in a basic distrust or dislike perhaps a fear of the foreigner, of the out of state person.</text>

            <text syncTime="4270.556">Do you you think the limitations which state places on voters and holding public office is rooted in some of the same kind of hostility?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan M. Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="4284.666">It maybe Your Honor, but I think the voting area and this political public office area is very much distinguishable from this area before the court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.432">The government has much wider latitude in acting to protect its political processes, the governmental processes and they just -- and they don’t have that latitude in the area which is before us today of social or economic benefits which are based upon a classification on alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.066">That’s the teaching of Takahashi which says that a state is very much limited in making a classification based on alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.678">I might point out in response to the Commonwealth’s argument that Takahashi wasn’t an alienage case, that the provision of the state law based upon a federal citizenship requirement did not mention any racial exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.694">And footnotes both in Takahashi and Oyama point to Japanese and other groups which were affected by that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.240">More over this Court had an opportunity in Takahashi to view this as a racial case, as an anti-Japanese case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.120">And in fact, this option is made clear by the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge in Murphy who perhaps would have preferred to view it as an anti-Japanese case, but that’s not the way the majority of the court view the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.592">The majority of the court viewed the case and equated alienage with color as both being impermissible basis for classification both under the Fourteenth Amendment and both under the Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4398.378">Well, we add Your Honor that it is in conflict both of the Equal Protection argument and those statutes that put that clause in effect like Section 1981, like the Section 2000 (d) in 42 U.S.C. which promulgate that principle of equality between citizens and aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.138">We have named plaintiffs in this case, or aliens, permanent resident aliens of Pennsylvania who have had a history of productive and sustained work before becoming ill and requiring public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.434">The classification established is one between two indistinguishable classes, needy residents of Pennsylvania on the one hand who are citizens, needy residents of the state who are not U.S. Citizens, and we maintain that on either of the two Equal Protection tests, this classification must fall either on the basis that there is simply no rational relationship to a constitutionally permissible legislative purpose or on -- perhaps an equally applicable test that the state must meet a heavy burden of justification in validating and justifying this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.752">The latter test we suggest is applicable because we are dealing with the suspect criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.497">Suspect because history has shown that when this criterion is used to basic classification, it’s often been amassed where simply a rational prejudice against that particular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.956">I might add in addition, we’re dealing with a group which is a (Inaudible) minority, disenfranchised and which is politically defenseless and can’t rely upon the political processes for redress of grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="5442.657">I might go into this by continuing my argument that the same scrutiny which the Equal Protection Clause does require of this legislation is also required because this is an area that has been preempted by the federal government and as Heim states must be an area confined to the narrowest limits to a state regulation.</text>
