            <text syncTime="47.595" offset="293804">This case involves an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it applies to discharge of an employee because of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.015" offset="343437">The case also involves the question of election of remedies where an employee proceeds to arbitration under the labor contract and also seeks to assert his rights under the Civil Rights Act including suit in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.013" offset="439463">After 15 years of employment by Reynolds Metals Company, petitioner Robert Dewey was progressively disciplined and discharged for refusing to work on assigned Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.411" offset="501008">There were three Sundays involved in 1966 August 28, September 4 and September 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.881" offset="534862">Dewey’s refusal to work on those Sundays was based on his stipulated religious beliefs which prohibited him from working on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.464" offset="585226">He had communicated these beliefs to Reynolds sometime prior to any of the Sundays in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.913" offset="623052">Dewey’s stipulated religious beliefs also forbade him from asking another person to work in his place.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.522" offset="657429">And this religious belief also had been communicated to Reynolds prior to any of the Sundays in question.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="211.338" offset="948746">Suppose an employer in a particular -- in a small enterprise has all of his employees who share this belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.602" offset="985736">What does he do about that and no one will work on Sunday?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_oosterhouse" startTime="228.527" stopTime="267.291">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Oosterhouse</label>
            <text syncTime="228.527" offset="1017501">Well, that obviously presents a difficult situation in terms of the Commission’s guidelines and it might well be in that kind of a situation that undue hardship upon the employer would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.273" offset="1100466">There are many possible variations here and I would think if the employer schedules Sunday work as a regular fulltime day, this is reasonably within in his discretion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="267.291" stopTime="305.538">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="267.291" offset="1172564">Well, there are many enterprises of course which -- in which the employer has no choice about a public utility, electric power company, and telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.193" offset="1208195">Let’s assume that its situation in which the employer has no choice, he has a franchise which requires him to give 24-hour service, seven days a week at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.439" offset="1253125">And then alter a little bit, suppose he has 10 employees and five of them assert this privilege as it was suggested I think in one of the briefs and all the burden of Sunday work falls on the other five who are not so observant of the Sundays.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_oosterhouse" startTime="305.538" stopTime="614.151">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Oosterhouse</label>
            <text syncTime="305.538" offset="1325537">Well, I think the rational to answer this has to be in terms of the undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.799" offset="1366601">And I would like to point out that well hypothecs of much more difficult situations of more severe hardship can be easily imagined.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.071" offset="1411636">The facts are in this case that on each of the three Sundays involved substantially less than all of the employees in Mr. Dewey’s classification were called upon to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.404" offset="1476942">And further, that there were two employees out of the classification who were nonetheless qualified to work and one of the days in question, Reynolds in fact asked one of these employees to work in Dewey’s place.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.792" offset="1550503">That is one of the employees outside of the classification and he did work and none of the horrible consequences which we read about predicted in Reynolds’ brief actually happened even though on that Sunday Reynolds did accommodate as we say they should.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.038" offset="1631483">However, on that day, they still disciplined Mr. Dewey.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.418" offset="1653008">Now, if Reynolds had scheduled Sunday as a full-shift day regularly, we would have a different situation, we would need evidence from Reynolds which we do not have in this case as to attempts to accommodate Dewey’s religious beliefs in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.736" offset="1750288">Would it be possible for example to schedule extra overtime for Dewey on Saturday and on Monday?</text>
            <text syncTime="420.276" offset="1784456">This would be a factual question as to whether this would be a reasonable solution to keep -- to get the work done.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.095" offset="1827715">Now, if you take an example wherein the -- every single person in a classification objects to working on Sunday, I suppose the employer would experience undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.001" offset="1883408">Although again, this might bear some further investigation as to possible ways to get this work done within the requirements of the company by late Saturday overtime and early Monday overtime or any one of a number possibilities which might be arrived at without undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.546" offset="2045576">When Mr. Dewey was discharged, he pursued his rights both under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 starting by filing a charge with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission and following the timely procedures filing with the EEOC and ultimately starting action in the District Court of the Western District of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.878" offset="2154872">Almost simultaneously, he also started the grievance procedure under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.011" offset="2191444">This contract had a provision for binding arbitration, his grievance was processed through arbitration prior to the time that he had began suit in the Western District of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.334" offset="2252675">And the ruling of the arbitrator gave him no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.471" offset="2277230">The ruling of the arbitrator was based on language in the contract which is not similar to the language of the Civil Rights Act and he found that while this language was intended to provide relief for occasional circumstances, it was not intended to exempt an employee from every Sunday working.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.053" offset="2403558">In the arbitration hearing, Mr. Dewey was represented by his Union and not by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.532" offset="2445458">Reynolds was represented by Attorney William Coughlin and while Reynolds’ filed a post hearing brief the Union did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.956" offset="2479208">The arbitration opinion, I think makes clear that the Civil Rights Act was not in fact considered by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.328" offset="2532707">The operative language of the statute in Section 703 (a) (1) --</text>

            <text syncTime="632.968" offset="2635212">Of course the arbitrators have different views in how much they will look into statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.797" offset="2670529">I would think the correct view on the relation between this statute and arbitration is that even if he had discussed the Civil Rights Act, the arbitration should not be considered as binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.511" offset="2805426">I would say that that clause if agreed to by the union is going to beyond its power in bargaining away an individual employee’s rights under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
