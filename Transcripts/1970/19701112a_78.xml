            <label>Mr. Charles J. McCarthy</label>
            <text syncTime="55.895" offset="326928">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.503" offset="349393">The issue in this case is the reviewability of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which authorizes the nation's railroads to raise their freight rates an average of 5% or nearly a half billion dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.899" offset="450957">I think it's important to have in mind just how this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.367" offset="480841">The usual procedure followed by a railroad when it wishes to change a rate is to file the new rate with the commission, 30 days before its effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.668" offset="546043">During that 30 day period, the rate is subject to protest and to suspension and investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.013" offset="599437">If the commission determines not to suspend or investigate, the rate goes into effect, the commission's action is discretionary, not reviewable and one who wishes to complain of the rate must file a formal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.497" offset="677386">On the other hand, if the commission decides to investigate the final order in the investigation proceeding is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.549" offset="745618">In a general increase case, the procedures that must be followed are a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.781" offset="778533">There are three reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.824" offset="790653">There are outstanding orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which prescribe rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.279" offset="820537">Those rates can't be changed without commission authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.574" offset="845720">Then in every general increase, situations arise in which there is a lesser rate for a longer distance that applies for a shorter distance included within the longer, and that of course is a violation of Section 4 of the Act, unless the commission authorizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.652" offset="969958">Finally there's the mechanical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.987" offset="987303">It's just not feasible to file increases in all the myriad railroad rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.030" offset="1023457">In a preferred procedure is to file a master tariff which includes all the increases and what are known as connecting link supplements.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.478" offset="1077269">These are supplements in each individual tariff which simply say that all of the rates in this tariff are subject to the increases in master tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.851" offset="1134738">The commission's tariff filing rules don't permit that so in order to follow that procedure, it's necessary to get authority to depart from those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.798" offset="1190536">The proceeding of which we seek review was initiated by the railroads by filing a petition asking for all three of these forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.825" offset="1258663">The commission immediately granted the tariff filing authority requested and it modified outstanding orders and granted fourth section relief, only to the extent necessary to permit the tariffs to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.699" offset="1362213">At this point, the situation is similar to what it would have been had no such authority been required.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.982" offset="1407352">The rates are filed, they're subject to protest; they're subject to investigation and suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.442" offset="1441102">There is one major difference though.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.039" offset="1459493">That is that the railroad -- that the commission could not at this point, simply say we won't investigate and that the rates going to affect because the commission has -- or the railroads have an obligation to get a modification of outstanding orders and fourth section relief before they can legally put these rates into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.089" offset="1567744">And that's recognized by the railroads in their petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.027" offset="1587493">They ask that the rates be authorized only after hearing and after a finding at the general level will not be more and is just unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.845" offset="1642768">The rates were protested.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.885" offset="1654888">The commission did suspend and the commission did initiate an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.417" offset="1689057">At the same time, it authorized the railroads to put into effect a 3% increase subject to investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.419" offset="1737017">That 3% increase isn't involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.468" offset="1745272">I mentioned that just in the interest of completeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.382" offset="1764916">The subsequent investigation was extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.865" offset="1782784">The commission divided the case into 10 sub proceedings to one, it assigned the question of revenue needs to the other 9, it assigned various commodities and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.342" offset="1860733">At the end of the revenue -- end of the hearing in the revenue sub proceeding, the commission ended its order of November 25th in which it authorized the railroads to put in all of the increases they had proposed with some minor exceptions subject to possible change as a result of the final outcome of the other 9 sub proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.263" offset="1992391">At the conclusion of all the hearings, the commission ended its order of January 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.892" offset="2030947">That order authorizes the railroads to put the increases in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.604" offset="2061772">It orders them to cease and desist from charging any higher increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.647" offset="2089984">It finds that the rates will not exceed a just and reasonable maximum on a general basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.556" offset="2133556">It modifies all outstanding orders of the commission and grants fourth section relief to the extent necessary to make these increases lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.174" offset="2196041">And finally the order says the proceeding is discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.009" offset="2223417">In other words, this is the last step in this general increase case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.201" offset="2260198">The plaintiffs in number 106 are shippers or associations of shippers who pay more than 20% of the nation's freight bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.812" offset="2326653">And the action was filed as a class action in behalf of all shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.965" offset="2367195">In every general increase case, I don't care whether it's a railroad or what kind of utility it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.923" offset="2403035">There are two basic questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.901" offset="2419022">One, what increase if any should be authorized?</text>
            <text syncTime="586.439" offset="2449115">How much more money should be provided by an increase in rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="591.641" offset="2469909">And the second question is, how are we going to spread that increase out over the various services that this utility performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.750" offset="2526333">Our complaint goes to the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.391" offset="2548903">We say that the commission did not apply the rate making standards in the Interstate Commerce Act and that if it had applied them, it could not have authorized this increase on the present record.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.869" offset="2634898">We also say that the commission should have looked at the needs of the railroads in each of the main regions of the country, rather than just a general overall increase, and we say that the commission should have looked at types of traffic by broad categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.902" offset="2738970">We do not say that the increase makes any specific rate unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.911" offset="2787035">The controlling principle as we see it, is that there is a presumption in favor of the reviewability of an agency order.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.160" offset="2855999">This Court has repeatedly said that an order will not be held to be non-reviewable, unless there is persuasive reason to believe that Congress so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.082" offset="2915662">The railroads point to nothing even remotely suggesting that Congress intended to accept general increase orders from the broad statutory authorization that it has given the review orders of Interstate Commerce Commission and to review rate orders generally in the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.962" offset="3031228">The railroads basically make two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.458" offset="3049200">They say we haven't exhausted our administrative remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.861" offset="3106774">It is a creature of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.505" offset="3121403">The Act provides two sections under which proceedings can be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.438" offset="3149093">If a raid has not gone into effect, the investigation is under 157, if it has, then the shipper has to file a complaint under Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.960" offset="3199248">This is just a section 157 proceeding but it is necessary for the commission to grant the specific authorization because of its outstanding orders relief from tariff filing in the fourth section relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.111" offset="3323800">Well Your Honor, this is a proceeding which follows the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.543" offset="3357550">The commission is proceeding under the authority granted by Section 157 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.692" offset="3386180">So the particular way that the commission proceeds in this case is a matter of administrative decision perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.866" offset="3426826">But the authority to proceed and the basic procedure is all pursuant to Section 157 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.519" offset="3465488">Do you have specific review provisions in those sections?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_j_mccarthy" startTime="845.040" stopTime="1223.410">
            <label>Mr. Charles J. McCarthy</label>
            <text syncTime="845.040" offset="3483564">There is a specific review provision Section 1336 of Title 28 which says that all others in the Interstate Commerce Commission are subject to review in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.003" offset="3559424">Court please, I think of the general level of freight rates as being a horizontal line and the individual rates are dots.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.178" offset="3616057">Some of them are above that line and some of them are below.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.165" offset="3644061">And the average height of all those dots is the same height as that horizontal line.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.055" offset="3679587">Now suppose, we raise that line 5%, if all of the rates are raised proportionately, the relationship of each rate to that new line is the same as its relationship to the old line was.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.098" offset="3771747">The railroads say we need to go back to the commission before we can have review of the order raising that horizontal line and file complaints on the million or so rates in which we are interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.415" offset="3841024">What would the issue be in such a proceeding, when the lawfulness of an individual rate is challenged, the question is, how it is related to the general level of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.644" offset="3905912">It doesn't involve the question of where the general level of reasonableness is.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.396" offset="3936946">Now we are not challenging the relationship of individual rates to that general level.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.111" offset="3967770">So if we followed the railroad suggestion and went back to the commission where these thousands or millions of cases, we would have to say to the commission, we do not challenge the relationship of any of these rates to the new level that you have set, all we want to challenge is what is that level which you have just set in a proceeding that has just been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.980" offset="4115310">Now, that is the administrative procedure that the railroads say “we haven't exhausted it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.015" offset="4167450">What the railroads are really saying is that shippers have no interest in the general level of freight rates, no legal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.940" offset="4207156">They certainly have a tremendous practical interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.261" offset="4228368">It's more important to a shipper to have his rates raised 5% across the board than it is to have one individual rate raised or to have one individual rate that he thinks is a little bit too high and wouldn't it be a little anomalous to say that he can have Court review where his interests are affected to a minor degree and can't have Court review, if his interests are affected to a major degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.651" offset="4377997">Now that brings me to the policy question, the railroads argue that this Court should deny relief because some District Court might improvidently grant interlocutory relief to a shipper, to the railroads detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.630" offset="4485935">From my experience, I think that danger is greatly exaggerated but I suppose it is possible that the District Court might act improvidently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.093" offset="4543718">But there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.287" offset="4556570">In the first place, if the safeguards that attach to interlocutory relief are not sufficient in a general increase case, then the thing to do is to shore up those safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.945" offset="4643192">It's not to deny judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.708" offset="4662209">You don't throw out the baby with the bath water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.056" offset="4683630">In a second place when Congress authorized review of the Interstate Commerce Commission orders, it knew then interlocutory relief would be granted in cases which the Courts think are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.842" offset="4766699">If the safeguards and interlocutory relief are not sufficient, the railroads ought to be talking to the Congress and not to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.614" offset="4837857">And while we‘re on the field of public policy, I would just like to remind the Court that there are two sides to every coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.772" offset="4882474">And we think that the policy reasons for judicial review vastly out weigh any on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.229" offset="4920299">If an agency is insulated from judicial review, there is always the risk that there are handling of cases of this kind may become perfunctory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.610" offset="5213811">In this new level of reasonableness that you've established and we want to re-litigate everything that you did in 259.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.382" offset="5252890">The commission very properly is going to say “This isn't the forum to do it and that is you would settle it” and wouldn't it be a monstrous administrative procedure to say that you retail this old ground in all of these individual cases after the commission has spent months and thousands of pages of testimony and arguments and briefs resolving this specific question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.060" offset="5879620">In this particular case Your Honor, we had a somewhat different approach to the order from that of Mr. McCarthy and it would have been somewhat difficult perhaps to combine the suits.</text>

            <label>Mr. James O’malley</label>
            <text syncTime="1480.358" offset="6024756">We do believe, however since this is – as you say it that the threshold, it's a terribly important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.076" offset="6055685">We do note that there is a doctrine of latches, we believe it would be applicable in this area although there isn't a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.960" offset="6103228">But the finality and judicial reviewability of the commission order if I may resume argument sir, are also at issue since in both cases, since both Courts below held that the general revenue proceeding of the commission and the order was not final and not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.126" offset="6199881">We agree with Mr. McCarthy, these Atlantic City appellants which are-- Footnote four, electric utilities and 10 state departments of agriculture including Attorney General of New York representing the state of New York Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.900" offset="6275009">We agree with the United States and the Commission and the Alabama appellants that the lower courts were wrong in dismissing the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.493" offset="6309386">We all agree that those parts of the commission order that dealt with findings of general revenue needs to the railroads, nationwide cost to the railroads that the railroads required additional revenues were final determinations and the right for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.462" offset="6381171">The position of these appellants, I represent differs on the reviewability point from that of the Alabama appellants somewhat but not very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.458" offset="6429236">The United States Commission take the position that the order appealed from was final only in the aspect of revenues and findings of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.147" offset="6491930">It is our position that the order should be reviewable in its entirety and that it is totally right for judicial review under the principles of the City of Chicago, data processing in Barlow v. Collins cases, recently familiar to this Court -- decisions of this Court and under the the general provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.926" offset="6583045">The railroads differ from all other parties by seeking affirmance of the orders herein on the grounds that no part of the commission order can be reviewed and it's not final and not right for review but that is not reviewable as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.330" offset="6644694">Turning now to our argument that the scope of the judicial review should encompass the entire order Your honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.958" offset="6671235">I believe it might be helpful although it may sound as though I am repeating some of the things that Mr. McCarthy said to touch briefly on the general revenue proceeding itself as an illustration -- and foundation for our contention that the other parts of the order were as final as the parts of the order which were alluded to Mr. McCarthy and are accepted by the Government as reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.126" offset="6807907">After the railroads filed the master tariff which increased the rates on firstly all commodities in the country by varying percentages from 3% to 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.071" offset="6851688">The commission after suspending the tariff as Mr. McCarthy has said entered upon an investigation and of the proposed increases commodity by commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.104" offset="6891813">The railroads consistently refused to produce any evidence related to the costs of transporting bituminous steam coal or grain, for example in the commodity hearings related to those commodities, the sub hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.600" offset="6953775">Those refusals were upheld on appeal to the commission within the framework of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.359" offset="6976763">The railroads also failed to introduce any evidence that the proposed increases would not drive coal, grain the other commodities from the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.668" offset="7018036">It was on this kind of sparse and deficient record that the commission concluded first that the percentage increases on coal and grain and on all other commodities that they finally found would not “exceed maximum reasonable levels,” and second that those increases would not have a diversionary effect and to move them to traffic by rail and to the spectral latter finding, the commission said in its final order and then that this is in the Appendix of page 393 (a) “The increased freight rates and charges authorized herein will have no on due adverse effect on the movement of traffic by railway” to be precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.771" offset="7190444">It is the position of these appellants that such findings which constitute a statutory refinement for the Commission permitting the increased rates to become effective, have just as much finality and require judicial review fully as much as to its findings on the railroad costs and revenue needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.506" offset="7273409">If Your Honors please, there's another aspect of this chase of this revenue proceeding that it seems to us should be equally reviewable and it relates to the commission to purchase from what we regard as proper procedures in conducting the general revenue proceedings resulting in these final determinations at the termination of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.219" offset="7360240">We regard them as essential to its findings on cost revenues and across the board commodity percentage increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.767" offset="7390438">For example, or as admittedly no participation in the hearings by the commission personnel in the face of the kind of record that had to be presented in a general revenue proceeding fragmented evidence by many diverse shippers and the railroad's failure to present anything but the most general statistical evidence on overall cost and revenue needs on a country wide basis with no cost evidence on a commodity by commodity basis and no substantial evidence we submit on the possible effects of diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.795" offset="7510601">It appears to us that there was deficient record requiring the commission by counsel and its staff under the Scenic Hudson doctrine decided as you will recall in the Second Circuit 354 F. 2d as to which this Court denied certiorari at 384 U.S. under the Scenic Hudson doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.769" offset="7594402">We submit that the commission had a duty as an agency, an obligation to develop and produce a complete record in all these aspects in which the record was deficient and we believe that the order of the commission should also be reviewable in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.419" offset="7653021">Now the railroads require shippers in order to obtain reviewability of this order of the commission to re-litigate before the commission and proceedings under Sections 13 and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.061" offset="7727626">All these issues that in our view and we submit, it seems apparent from the record and the nature of the order or final decisions in the general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.691" offset="7782170">The Government would require by its position that commission procedures and findings as to diversion of traffic and the reasonableness of commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.231" offset="7820309">If I understand the Government's position correctly and I'm sure Mr. Springer will correct me later if I'm wrong would have to be re-litigated in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.978" offset="7863254">Now, we respectfully submit as I believe Mr. McCarthy has already advised the Court that neither Sections 13 or 15 contemplates the review of determinations of such broad questions as are considered in general revenue proceedings at which the commission has setup to deal with special economic problems of the railroads on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.881" offset="7962937">Those sections are designed to review the particular rate of a particular shipper for particular traffics in particular localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.352" offset="8012779">The commission is -- after hearings on these matters as to specific rates, then has the power to make reparations or adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.148" offset="8055933">They are not designed to consider the question of the kind that the railroads would have referred to them or that the Government would have referred to them and we note that the commission itself in 1958 I believe, decided a specific case, the Koppers coal case at 303 ICC where it refused to review general revenue findings in a Section 13 proceeding brought by coal shipper and we believe that decision is correct within the proper statutory scheme and the Government is in agreement with us on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.929" offset="8231058">Now, these -- if Your Honors could contemplate the situation where all the issues in this general revenue proceedings were to be re-litigated in a Section 13 and section 15 proceeding, if the statute permitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.551" offset="8329592">The evidence to be presented by the shippers would have to be the same as it was presented in the earlier cases and rejected by the commission in its order in the general revenue proceedings on these broad issues and with the same evidence presented can it be reasonably contemplated that the commission would then conclude that it had previously committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.741" offset="8406288">We respectfully submit that we think none but --</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.727" offset="10870262">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.875" offset="10882905">I'm here on behalf of three distinct Federal Government parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.809" offset="10898578">First the United States which was a statutory defendant in the District Court as it is in most ICC review proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.111" offset="10927835">Second, the commission itself whose order is in question and third the Secretary of Agriculture who has an independent statutory responsibility in ICC proceedings involving rates on farm products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.643" offset="10977991">The secretary was a party in the commission proceedings below and he intervened as a plaintiff in the District Court proceedings in the District of Columbia case that is the Alabama Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.975" offset="11027310">Though he did not become a party, as the secretary in the Atlantic City Electric case which was subsequently began in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.437" offset="11065135">Because of their differing responsibilities, these three federal parties have taken different positions on the merits of the ICC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.794" offset="11094497">Secretary of Agriculture generally cites but the plaintiffs in the Alabama Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.932" offset="11115081">The commission of course defends its order on the merits and the United States though a statutory party concluded that it could neither support nor oppose the commission's order in the District Court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.064" offset="11175581">That the courts below did not reach the merits and so we submit they are not in issue here since the courts below both dismissed the complaints before them on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for relief that is a claim for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.155" offset="11260008">So the only question here is whether the threshold question, whether the commission's order was reviewable, is reviewable and if so to what extent.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="springer" startTime="2801.208" stopTime="3167.222">
            <label>Mr. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="2801.208" offset="11308178">As to that I'm just going to say Mr. Justice Black the -- my three clients are substantially in agreement on that which is why I think I can appropriately speak for all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.262" offset="11352377">We believe that the Alabama Power case complaint in the Columbia District Court does state a claim for judicial review and so we agree, I think completely with Mr. McCarthy's clients in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.623" offset="11405876">In the Atlantic City Electric case there is to be sure a relatively minor disagreement between the United States and the commission which are the only two federal parties in that case but in terms of the relief we suggest a remand of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.990" offset="11479333">This difference becomes of relatively little importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.500" offset="11505351">Both the United States and the commission do however disagree significantly with the plaintiffs in the Atlantic City Electric case as I shall elaborate in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.722" offset="11550281">I think it's fair to say to that the only disagreement among any of the parties including the railroads on this reviewability question is a disagreement as to whether the various aspects of the general revenue order have sufficient pragmatic finality to make review appropriate now or whether on the other hand, review should be differed until shippers have exhausted further administrative remedies of challenging particular rates by complaints under section 13 of the Act which the commission would then consider under section 151 after the rates have gone into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.456" offset="11689148">We think that it's clear from both the Court's decision last term in the City of Chicago case and more particularly on this issue from the decision several years ago in Abbot Laboratories against Gardner that this is the only question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.215" offset="11760201">Abbot Laboratories, I think established the proposition that review should be available at the earlier stage at which the agency has made a final determination and a controversy as to the validity of that determination has rightly as to the existence of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.600" offset="11821746">I think there's no question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.538" offset="11829478">The shippers are paying higher rates because of the commission's decisions so the only question I think fairly is finality which as the Court again indicated in Abbot laboratories, there is a pragmatic question based upon a careful analysis of what the agency has actually done and what kind of attack, the parties seeking review are making upon what the agency is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.074" offset="11967718">So that I think I should proceed now to review once again and perhaps from a somewhat different aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.246" offset="12008364">The issues that were before the commission in this general revenue proceeding and what the commission did with those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.954" offset="12035218">The general revenue proceeding is an investigation under Section 157 of the Interstate Commerce Act which generally permits the commission to make a final determination in advance of the effectiveness of new rates as to whether those rates are lawful or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.602" offset="12097808">Section 157 explicitly permits the commission to do an advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.357" offset="12116825">Everything that it could do after the effectiveness of new rates under Section 151 and the 151 proceeding could be either on the commission's own motion or in response to a complaint by shipper under Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.175" offset="12188087">Both therefore -- both of these subsections contemplate that the commission will make the same kind of inquiry that is it will determine whether the rates are just unreasonable and further whether they are called unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential or prejudicial and Section 1582 expands upon just and reasonable standard, so that that inquiry in substance includes two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.211" offset="12328208">First, what are the railroads revenue needs if they are to provide adequate and efficient service at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service and under honest economical and efficient management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.177" offset="12380035">And the second question under the just and reasonable rubric is what effect will an increase in whatever rates are in question have upon the movement of traffic, more particularly will they -- will such an increase divert traffic from the rail carriage to such an extent as to defeat the purpose of the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.983" offset="12471254">Now when all the rail roads in the country want to as they did here and as they have previously and subsequently want to increase all of their freight rates to compensate for increased costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.936" offset="13979146">And of course, the Administrative Procedure Act says that the fact that reconsideration by the administrative agency is available does not preclude judicial review before such reconsideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.208" offset="14104221">So that's an essential condition to the increase, one that the commission considered separately, considered finally to the extent if at all there are any further administrative proceedings possible as to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.959" offset="14167228">They're only in the nature for reconsideration and the availability of such reconsideration if there is such availability is not a part to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.463" offset="14217174">This brings me then to the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.117" offset="14231803">The issues with which at least in large part, the New York plaintiffs are concerned having concluded that the railroads revenue needs justified an increase to a certain average level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.566" offset="14301602">The commission went on to consider the propriety of the allocation of the additional revenues among various shippers and various commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.949" offset="14359176">In particular, it had to consider or that Section 151 and 7 contemplate that it would consider whether the rates would have adverse effects on the movement of traffic, that is diversion and whether the rates are discriminatory or preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.237" offset="14428348">Here the question is not what the railroads need but what individual shippers and shipping various things in various places are willing to pay rather than decide not to ship by rail and what they can fairly be required to pay considering the relationships among the various rates and other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.239" offset="14516328">As I say the commission has given some consideration to these matters and the general revenue proceeding and it did throw out a relatively small number of the particular rates because of defects that became apparent to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.755" offset="14578395">And it's kind of preliminary once over on these detailed rate by rate or rate group by rate group issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.871" offset="14614862">But it certainly did not conclude exhaustively that no rate might have such a defect and therefore expressly left open as it does in these general rate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.750" offset="14678392">Left it open for shippers to institute subsequent proceedings by complaints under Section 13 which could result in Section 151 proceedings to attack particular rates of interest to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.240" offset="14736384">Specifically with reference to this Court's decision many years ago in the Arizona Grocery case, the commission said that we are not hereby prescribing all of the rates which we are in this kind of limited proceeding allowing the railroads to increase generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.401" offset="14821021">So that we think that the complaint in the Atlantic City case is in large measure an attack on this second aspect of the general revenue proceeding that the commission had it once over on particular rates and this are matters which while the commission has considered them, it has not considered them finally and could not on the record that the commission had before it and could have it before it and a proceeding under the kind of time pressures if there are in a general revenue proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.559" offset="14941602">In short, these shippers have not exhausted their administrative remedies and we think that judicial review should not be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.561" offset="14977651">As I indicated there is a minor disagreement in framework -- in the terms of the framework of this case between the commission and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.392" offset="15016939">The Secretary of Agriculture not being a party in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.217" offset="15028224">The United States believes that the Atlantic City complaints can be read perhaps as raising an attack on the general revenue needs findings and perhaps also as raising an attack upon the general nature of the kind of proceeding that the commission has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.963" offset="15103248">That of course is -- the commission has finally decided what kind of proceeding it's going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.259" offset="15124459">And I think to the extent that shippers may want to raise the question whether the commission can have a general revenue proceeding without finally determining all of the multitude of rates involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.816" offset="15178585">That theoretically at least is a question that is right for judicial review after the general review proceeding is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.458" offset="15209200">But the commission of United States does agree that under all the circumstances as to the New York case, it is appropriate to remand that case so that the parties can amend their -- plaintiffs can amend complaints if they wish and that the District Court can shape the litigation in accordance with the general principles that we have suggested.</text>

            <text syncTime="4135.365" offset="16644786">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.724" offset="16662235">I appear in this case to railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.926" offset="16691075">I think I should like to begin by commenting briefly on some aspects of the statutory plan that were touched upon this morning but which I think perhaps I should like to ask the Court to remember while I give my version of what happened in this case and what the case is really about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.337" offset="16812701">The point that I should like to particularly make is that when a carrier initiates a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.825" offset="16858676">The only authority that the commission has to interfere with a tiny of that rate increase prior to a final determination that a particular rates involved are unlawful is power to suspend the rates for seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.392" offset="16944985">At the end of that time the rates become effective by operation of law not by virtue of any order that the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.759" offset="16978422">That's what section 157 provides and they remain effective until the commission has made a final determination that the particular rates involved in a rate change are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.389" offset="17056893">This is the basic statutory plan that was involved and discussed in the Earl case and as the opinion there pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.961" offset="17103182">It was an accommodation between the interest of those who sought that the railroad should not be able to change any rate without prior approval of the commission and the position of the railroads who wanted to be able to change the rates without any interference by the commission subsequent only to a subsequent determination of their lawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.533" offset="17209553">And under this accommodation, the railroads bear irreparably the losses occasioned by the seven month suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.099" offset="17251767">If the rates thereafter held be lawful, the railroads have no way of recovering that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.257" offset="17276426">On the other hand, the shippers -- if the rates go into effect at the end of the seven months period are protected by their right to recover reparations or by the normal refund provisions of the commissions attached under 157.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.996" offset="17355316">Now with that preface, I should like to state what I think happened in this case and what the real pragmatic consequences to take Mr. Springer's words over this commission orders were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.122" offset="17419891">As it's been said the case started with a petition asking for leave to file a single master tariff which the commission granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.239" offset="17460328">Now, no review has been sought of that order and after they got the permission, the railroads filed a tariff which I think was to become effective on the 24th of June 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.092" offset="17511737">It had to make it that far ahead because the commission has a condition of getting the permission requiring it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.221" offset="17544234">The first thing that the commission did was to suspend that first master tariff for the entire seven months period and at the same time however, it said to the railroads “now if you want to file another tariff that makes only a 3% increase.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.097" offset="17635767">The increases in the master tariffs have been three to six, said to the railroads “if you wish to file another tariff, it makes only a 3% increase, we will not suspend that tariff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.018" offset="17691460">And the railroads did so and that 3% tariff went into effect, and the time the commission did this, it said to the railroads in effect in its order “now we are investigating this matter and we may decide later on that we should have suspended these rates even as to the 3% and if we decide that we should have done that as to any or all of these rates, then you are going to have to restore the situation to what it would have been if we had suspended the rates by making refunds.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.307" offset="17868570">The next thing that the commission did was to issue an issue an order in November which has been called its interim order and in that order it decided in effect that it should not have suspended the any part of the rate increase and that it would permit the entire rate increase to go in to effect at the end of November.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.632" offset="17973896">At the same time again saying to these carriers and a way it did that again was to say “you can file another tariff” which the railroads did which put the additional 3% into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.725" offset="18030320">At the same time, it said to the railroads “we're still looking at this and when we come to our final conclusion, if we decide that we should have suspended some or all of these rates for the entire statutory period, you are going to have to restore the situation to what it would have been if there had been such a suspension.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.290" offset="18108583">And in the end there in January it issued a final order in which it said some of these rates, few of them, I think there are about nine instances should have been suspended otherwise we think that our orders can stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.133" offset="18171904">So I submit to the Court that the issue in this case, my view of what's happened is simply whether an order of the commission which refuses to suspend a proposed rate increase for the entire seven months period but does not determine the lawfulness of all or any of the rates involved but leaves that to be determined in subsequent proceedings is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.550" offset="18341595">Because we believe that was the only consequence of what this commission did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.873" offset="18362911">To put the matter in other way, we say that what the actual pragmatic effect of these orders does not differ significantly from an order that a commission enters in any ordinary suspension case in which it refuses to suspend rates for all or any part or some part of the seven months suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.076" offset="18487672">Now, we believe that an order of that kind which we think this order is, should not be reviewable and our reasons rest both upon analysis of statute and upon certain practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.275" offset="18564472">The commission has been issuing these general revenue orders for more than 50 years and in the line of cases that we have cited and discussed in our brief from pages 24 to 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.679" offset="18626121">The Courts have held that these orders are not reviewable and that the shipper has an adequate remedy by way of complaint and reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.284" offset="18716505">The Courts have also held relates to what I said a moment ago about the effect of this order and its relationship to a suspension proceedings and they have held I think uniformly that an order of the commission that refuses to suspend rates is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.280" offset="18820472">Now, both of these lines of cases, those cases by the way are collected in the opinion in Long Island case in 193 Federal sub which is cited in our brief, at least the cases up to 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.815" offset="18870627">Since that time there have been a number of other cases refusing to review, orders that refuse to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.012" offset="18903437">Now both of these groups of cases, those that are refused to review the general revenue orders and those that have refused to review the orders declining to suspend, to examine the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.273" offset="18964459">It seems to me to rest on two related considerations, one rests on the structure of the Act and particularly on Section 157 because it seems clear and this was the purpose of my preliminary statement that under that section, the question whether the commission should interfere with the timing of a proposed rate increase by suspending the rates is not a matter that is appropriate for judicial review because it is committed to the commission's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.820" offset="19122657">The commission when it refuses to suspend a rate is not required to make any findings, not required by the statute to have any hearing, it's not required to give anybody any reasons for its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.913" offset="19187022">The statute permits it to do that and along ago in the board against the great northern case which I think is 281 U.S. the Court -- this Court said that the power suspension is entrusted to Congress or to the commission only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.489" offset="19273331">Now, we submit when you look at this, I'm going to come to the practical considerations in a moment but when you look at this body of authority and consider it has existed with the length of time that it has, we submit that there is no reason to depart from it in the case of these general revenue determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.574" offset="19369671">They do not and I will discuss this point in a moment also, they do not determine the lawfulness at any or all of these rates but railroads may increase as a result of the order and as I think they do not preclude the shipper from litigating any issue that is relevant in any Section 13 proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5128.760" offset="20618428">Commissioner Eastman in his concurring opinion said “essentially what we have here is a proceeding like a suspension proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5163.717" offset="20758235">I think in one of those opinions they quoted a Mr. Eastmans's statement in the 1920 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5181.860" offset="20830856">They argued that the remedy is not adequate and so far as I could understand, I think that argument rests essentially on the contention that because of the commission's determinations in a general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.343" offset="20916746">They will be precluded either by something like the doctrine of res judicata or as a practical matter from re-litigating these issues or relevant issues in a complaint proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.500" offset="20989367">Now, we submit that they are simply wrong about that and that there is no warrant in authority or logic or in the commission precedent or practice for the view they take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.486" offset="21041298">I think, I should say this in candor about these general revenue determinations that are made in a general revenue order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.589" offset="21077765">They relate of course to all rates and to all carriers as a group and they're made on the basis of typical evidence but in a very general way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.229" offset="21128338">Now the determinations that the commission makes on that kind of evidence and that kind of proceeding may have only a limited relevance in a proceeding relating to particular rates but although in commission in those proceedings does often give consideration to revenue needs of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.748" offset="21230320">Sometimes in general terms, sometimes simply in terms of the revenue needs as related to the particular traffic involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.275" offset="21272430">But of course that – these revenue needs in a particular rate proceeding have only one several factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.473" offset="21305240">The commission has often told the railroads that they can't justify a rate -- particular rate just because they need money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.512" offset="21333452">They have to justify it -- it's reasonableness on other grounds and the commission looks at comparisons with comparable rates, with a nature of commodity, with a cost involved, to what degree there is competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.279" offset="21404505">Whereby other modes of transportation, the suggestion that these particular rate cases that commission doesn't examine the problem of diversions, this I think as mistaken and look at all they seem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.159" offset="21456018">Now to the extent that any issue that is determined on revenue needs or anything else is relevant in a particular rate proceeding, complaint proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.786" offset="21510562">We submit that the commission will look at it, the shipper is not precluded from raising it and litigating it and getting entitled to have judicial review of any determination the commission makes about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.054" offset="21567613">Now they have cited this, there had been some discussions of Koppers case, 303 ICC, I think Mr. Springer is quite candid in indicating and I joined with him that no one quite knows what that murky passage in the opinion means.</text>

            <text syncTime="5385.690" offset="21646085">I think all it meant was that the commission wasn't going to litigate in that case whether it made a mistake in refusing to suspend the rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="5397.147" offset="21691956">There are other cases and we have cited them in our brief, one is the Gold Soap case where the railroads try to justify a rate on the ground that it had been issued pursuant to a general revenue order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.712" offset="21738245">And the commission said “no, you can't do that, that's no justification whatsoever to this rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.108" offset="21767816">We didn't approve this rate, we didn't fix this rate, you have got to justify it” and I think what is more significant is that the commission has awarded reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.250" offset="21820374">Bound rates were unjust to be unjust and unreasonable and awarded reparation with respect to rates that were established pursuant to these general revenue orders and when the carry railroad who tried to argue that those orders of justification for the rates that commission has said “no,” they are not a justification and at least in one instance the Court said that that was quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.214" offset="21932178">That's the Cotton Valley Oil Company case, I think which is against the Southern Railway which I think is in 51 Federal supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.422" offset="21965093">So as a practical matter and I accept the pragmatic test has a practical matter in these complaint proceedings, even though the rate is at the level fixed by or level that the railroads is fixed pursuant to some general revenue order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.831" offset="22046699">The commission has looked at the rates, held they were unjust and unreasonable and given the shippers reparation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5499.249" offset="22100407">I altogether understand the argument that the appellant made on this point of the adequacy of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.787" offset="22130500">They have referred to the fact that the commission did say in its report when it decided that not to suspend these rates for a full period that it found that the general level of the rates was be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.740" offset="22202284">Filed an statement which it immediately qualified by saying we're only talking about the general basis of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.373" offset="22224854">We're not holding that any of the rates are lawful and they are all subject to investigation and complaint in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.168" offset="22255992">But then the appellants say that in a complaint proceeding they can't attack the general level of these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.503" offset="22289429">And at that point, either because of some weakness of the flesh or infirmity of the mind, I cannot follow because I had assumed perhaps in blindness that what a shipper pays is the rate that is applicable to his shipments and his commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.337" offset="22360691">He doesn't pay any general rate level and that under the statute, if he has a remedy that will give him a just and reasonable rate which he has in this case that that satisfies the statute and if he gets judicial review in that proceeding that that is an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.726" offset="22430281">Now I think if you look and you could only do what I think by random sampling, you will see that when the commission determines the justness and reasonableness of particular rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.709" offset="22474167">This abstraction of the general rate level does not have any weight in these deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5781.225" offset="23228270">The one in 1969, they just -- they let that go into effect at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.113" offset="23267871">They refused to investigate anything except questions of discrimination and preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.532" offset="23289501">They wouldn't investigate reasonableness and they did this in an order that's a page and a half, they didn't go through this elaborate discussion to make these findings and all these reasons and under the statute they can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.487" offset="23341328">They have developed a practice over the years of writing these elaborate dissertations in these general revenue cases and this and why they used the language in the suspension cases, I could not attempt to explain but if I may go back to the problem of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.434" offset="23421158">I think the appellants have not quite met the real problem there which is a problem I think that suggests that the kind of relief that they really want on judicial review can't be obtained without doing violence to the statutory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.979" offset="23503287">Now what I mean by that is this, these general rate proceedings frequently consume a large part of the statutory seven months suspension period and people can't go into Court until the commission is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.018" offset="23563473">Now when somebody goes into Court and wants interlocutory relief and it's natural for him to do so because that's one of the purpose of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.055" offset="23611643">The Court is going to be faced with a problem of whether it can enjoin the rate increase beyond the seven months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.723" offset="23646229">Because in some cases by the time they get to Court, the seven months period will expire or nearly expire and the same question will arise as to and it was raised this morning I think or after lunch as to what the Court does after a final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.757" offset="23714356">If it finds that there was some infirmity in the commissions order, does it enjoin the rates for more than seven months period?</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.150" offset="23751973">Now, the position of the railroads is that neither the commission nor a Court even as an incident to judicial review can enjoin or suspend rates if not been adjudicated to be unlawful as such beyond the seven months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.722" offset="23818219">But the law on that point is not yet clear and what the railroads with a reason apprehend is that first it can't be certain how the question must be settled and second until the question is settled and settled applies -- as soon a way that applies to all the possible situations that these general rate increases are going to be indefinitely delayed in many cases beyond the seven months period by interlocutory and final injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.756" offset="23950399">As has been observed these suits can be brought in any district in the country, they could involve different commodities, different shippers, different argument could be made about the general rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.772" offset="24002435">The Government recognizes this problem and it's attempted to make some palatine suggestions which we have discussed in our brief but I think when you look at those suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.351" offset="24044753">Consider all of them you can see that it is not, they are not likely to really solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.888" offset="24082892">And of course if the problem as I cannot get relief beyond the seven months period which is our position, then one of the principle purposes of judicial review I suppose is gone at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.834" offset="24150706">The judicial review of these orders also creates a difficult problem about the refund provisions of the commission's general revenue orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.479" offset="24205249">Now we have discussed that matter in our brief and I should like to refer the Court to that discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.674" offset="24234088">I simply like to say this about it that that is a difficulty that arises because these refund provisions and these general revenue orders are little peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.982" offset="24283303">Unlike the normal refund provision in an ordinary Section 157 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.190" offset="24312142">They do not come in to operation or the operation does not depend I should say upon a final determination that that the particular rates are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.249" offset="24352371">Their operation simply depends upon the determination by the commission that it made a mistake in allowing the rates to become effective or not to suspend the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.199" offset="24408168">So that under these provisions the railroads could and do at times have to refund money that they have collected from rates that are never been determined to be unlawful and which they have to be determined to be unlawful simply because the commission has determined that the rate should have been suspended.</text>

            <text syncTime="6126.676" offset="24610043">And when the railroads take advantage of that refusal of course, they have to accept the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.808" offset="24642644">They are bound by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.284" offset="24648495">Now if these refunds is here to for, there's been uncertainty about these refunds but the railroads have at least been certain that the time within which the liability would accumulate would be limited at the time that the commission was required to consider the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.100" offset="24727803">And while there was uncertainty it was an uncertainty that arose from the uncertainties about what one agency would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.956" offset="24759150">Now there has to be judicial review of these orders, of course the times in which this uncertainty will continue and that length of time in which these contingent liabilities will accumulate will be extended and the uncertainties will be increased by the facts that there you have two agencies and instead of one and his views on these matter may differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.098" offset="24851728">Now that means that when the railroads get a general rate increase if there is to be judicial review, they are going to have a very great problem about whether they can use this money or how much of it they can use or whether they have to setup a contingent reserve to take care of this contingent liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.930" offset="24927065">They can't very well plan or make definitive plan that may hamper the ability to use the money for permanent purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.121" offset="24959875">In the present cash position of many of the railroads this is rather a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.282" offset="24992475">I have so far in this argument talked about the commission's order simply in terms of what its consequences are on the general level of rates or on rates generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.801" offset="25034585">I would now like to say something about the -- I think a minor point really about the provisions of the orders that grant relief under the fourth section and from outstanding order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.732" offset="25090278">Those provisions of the order affect only a very small number of the rates and they do not have much economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.695" offset="25126118">I am told that the rate experts in the rate conferences say that even without that relief, they could generally achieve the economic results of a -- one of the general revenue orders by excluding those rates and making them the subject of separate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.512" offset="25213471">But for purposes of this afternoon I'm going to assume that orders that grant fourth section relief and it relieve from outstanding orders are in an appropriate case reviewable but my submission is that this in this case, it is not, this is not an appropriate case to review the provisions of those provisions of the orders that are here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.828" offset="25322663">The appellants here haven't not alleged in any of the named appellants are affected in any degree by those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.184" offset="25364146">They have not argued that they are affected and when you look at their arguments, they aren't directed to fourth section problems or to any problems that arise under outstanding rate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.378" offset="25404897">They're directed to the general revenue determinations of the commission in a way that it made them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.919" offset="25427048">Now in a precisely similar situation, one of the Algoma case in 11 Federal supplement where the same kind of an argument that was made, the Court said “Well these shippers haven't shown they're affected, these provisions are simply incidental to the main purpose of the order and we won't refuse them and we submit that that should be the conclusion here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.473" offset="25537285">I am not going to say anything about the assertion that some of these appellants represent all shippers, all commodities in the United States except to say that in this, there is some -- this vague indication that who these members of this enormous class maybe and that are affected by the fourth section orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.016" offset="25619414">I shouldn't think that justify judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.072" offset="25635610">And finally if the Court should think that it has to look at that part of these orders and I suggest that the review should extend only to those rates that are covered by the fourth section provisions and the relief from outstanding orders and not extend to the generality of rates or the general revenue determination that are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.115" offset="25751803">I think that I should like to conclude by saying something about the merits of this case, we have asked this Court if it -- and the unhappy event that it should determine that these orders are reviewable to consider the merits of the orders and affirm them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.111" offset="25847829">Now, we knew and we made that request that this Court has often said that will not or is it reluctant to consider agency orders, findings that have not been reviewed by lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.617" offset="25909791">But that I assume is not a iron-clad rule and this Court has sometimes departed from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.346" offset="25940720">And I am obliged to say that there are very urgent and powerful considerations in the present situation that would suggest that it would be appropriate for this Court to determine the validity of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.007" offset="26003414">For one thing this contingent liability under the refund provisions is accumulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.988" offset="26031313">It accumulates possibly at the rate of 400 million dollars a year and if the railroads are going to have to give some or all of that back, it seems to me the sooner they know about it better.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.096" offset="26079796">But apart from that as it has been stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6496.543" offset="26089514">There have been three rate increases since this rate increase that is here involved and in the showing that the railroads made to the commission on those rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.990" offset="26147297">They of course assume the availability of this rate increase and the income it produces and presumably in granting relief of the commission itself assumed the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.986" offset="26191287">Now, again if this rate increase has to be invalidated in some way or the railroads are going to have to give back any or all of the large amounts of money involved, the sooner the railroads and I should suppose the commission know that the better so that they can decide whether they have to take any steps in view of that situation with respect to the revenue situation of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.954" offset="26295150">Now, as far as the merits are concerned, we argue them in our briefs and in its reply the appellants in Alabama Power made an argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.980" offset="26335274">The appellants in the Atlantic City case have refused to argue in their briefs in this Court although we tendered the issue to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.269" offset="26364426">But they insisted that there be included in the Appendix, a memorandum that they submitted to the District Court below and that memorandum contains their arguments on the merits so they are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.945" offset="26419179">Now we have discussed this matter of the merits to the commission's order in detail in our brief and I shall merely like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.374" offset="26448854">I think when you look at the appellants arguments and consider the nature of the proceeding was here involved which was a proceeding as I have said really is essentially devoted to the question whether these rates should be suspended for the whole seven months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.353" offset="26520743">That those arguments do not provide any basis for over turning the commissions' judgment, apart from certain procedural arguments which really relate to how the commission manages its internal business, they are simply arguments that attack the commission's judgment on the evidence on the weight it gave to conflicting evidence on the inferences and conclusions it drew from the evidence and on the wisdom of its final determination not to spend these rates for the entire seven months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.253" offset="26684374">I think the arguments that are set forth in the reply of the Alabama Power appellants indicate that they say the commission shouldn't have authorized it nationwide, that it shouldn't have used 1966 as a test year for the increase in the expenses and other arguments that kind of matters about which reasonable men may differ but there are also matters as to which the commission has an area of judgment and which its judgment I suppose will be respected unless it's shown to be arbitrary and capricious and I think when you read the commission's report in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.725" offset="26842258">The interim report, the final report, the parent commission considered all the evidence, gave a reasoned statement for its conclusions and I think it is not impermissible for me to say at this point finally, that anyone who reads the facts that are set forth in the commission's reports in three succeeding general increase cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6714.768" offset="26962422">That have come along since these orders are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.017" offset="26987395">Anyone who looks to those reports and reads the facts they will contain, they contain I think would be led to the conclusion that when the commission decided in 1968 that the railroads were in immediate and drastic need of increased freight revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.213" offset="27072240">That experience has shown that the commission was not acting arbitrarily and unreasonably when on the basis of that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6749.794" offset="27102542">It declined to differ or suspend this rate increase.</text>

            <text syncTime="6793.684" offset="27278085">In the cases since 1920 Mr. Justice Stewart, my present recollection is maybe a little blurred that I think they have usually involved all the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6803.601" offset="27317791">Now before 1920, my recollection is that there were some cases which involved only the Eastern Railroads, and some cases which involved only the Western Railroads but I feel thoroughly confident that in the last 20 years, they have involved all the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.281" offset="27388531">Now sometimes the railroads ask for different amounts increases and they may have filed different applications but when the commission gets to consider them and usually treats as one big decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="6892.064" offset="27671594">If the Court please, this effort to equate suspension with the order in this case is pretty far fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.930" offset="27715062">Suspension is something an order not to suspend is an order which the commission makes without any record on a basis of a casual observation of the contentions of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.493" offset="27785383">Here, we have an order made after extensive hearings and on the basis of detailed findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.549" offset="27817566">That's the distinction between a suspension order and this type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.798" offset="27842539">The suspension order is discretionary and that's the reason it's not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.739" offset="27870333">Now the mere fact that an order doesn't finally fix the lawfulness of rates does not stop it from being reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.338" offset="27908681">In both interstate -- well, the McClain case and the Waterways case, the orders there involved did not finally fix the lawfulness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.888" offset="27970957">The Court commented that the rates were still subject to reparation but there was no question about them being reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.718" offset="28010245">Finally, I don't think I have been able to make myself clear as to the relationship between a general level of rates and a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.561" offset="28069595">When the commission fixes this general level and I go back in with a complaint against a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.478" offset="28105331">That general level is a standard against which my rate is measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="7005.705" offset="28126229">I don't get a chance to litigate that question again.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.644" offset="28141902">And if I am raising no question as I am about how a particular rate should be related to that general level, I have nothing to go back to the commission with.</text>
            <text syncTime="7023.266" offset="28196446">It's a waste of my time, a waste of the commission's time.</text>
