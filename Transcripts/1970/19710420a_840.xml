            <label>Mr. Paul N. Halvonik</label>
            <text syncTime="23.604" offset="197778">Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.708" offset="226200">Actually, this case is quite simple, the principle facts occurring in the years 1950-1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.436" offset="265070">The petitioner here lawfully entered the United States for the purpose of permanent residency in the year 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.470" offset="305298">In the summer of that year, he registered for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.955" offset="323166">He was, later that summer, drafted, but he didn’t submit to an induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.972" offset="343228">He signed an exemption from military service which was provided by the 1948 selective service law.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.808" offset="374575">That exemption provided that neutral aliens or permanent residents would be exempted from the draft if they executed the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.124" offset="415848">In exchange, they would be relieved of liability for service in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.227" offset="444270">The following year, in 1951, Congress amended the draft law to provide that permanent resident aliens could be drafted, thus, removing the exemption, part of the bargain in the favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.349" offset="512815">As we point out in our brief, this was a drastic departure from prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.077" offset="527653">Never before did neutral aliens been drafted by this Country if they chose not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.877" offset="558895">Petitioner was drafted again.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.559" offset="573628">This time he went down to submit to induction, but he was rejected because he did not-- he was not physically fit for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.788" offset="618559">The next significant date is 1952 when Congress adopted Section 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the section which petitioner contends controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.251" offset="664325">Section 315 provides what this Court has characterized as a two-pronged test where an alien who has sought exemption from military service is seeking citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.471" offset="713226">It provides that the alien must (1) have sought the exemption and (2) been relieved from military service prior to that 1952 law which required exemption because, the execution of the exemption, because that also grants release from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.173" offset="792116">But Congress, evidently, because of the intervening law taking away this release from liability for aliens who had signed the exemption now provided the two events had t occur, and we contend that the petitioner was not relieved from liability since he was drafted and that, therefore, he should be admitted to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.770" offset="870484">Now, the government, at least below and I assume, still takes the position that had petitioner actually served in the armed forces, he would be eligible for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.154" offset="923982">Now, we contend that that’s a misreading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.135" offset="931924">It says liability from military service, not service in the armed forces, not actual service.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.165" offset="951986">That if Congress meant actual service, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.928" offset="967032">It merely said those who were not relieved from liability are eligible for citizenship, and petitioner was not relieved from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.385" offset="996916">Moreover, it wouldn’t make much sense to make a distinction between those who were physically fit and could actually serve and those who would flump the physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.959" offset="1031189">The Congressional scheme makes a good deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.081" offset="1047698">Now the government, in its reply brief in this case, has raised a new argument that was not raised before, and that is that this section that has been the focus of all the litigation up to now, Section 315, isn’t applicable to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.177" offset="1112064">The government and both Courts below thought it was applicable and did both Courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.838" offset="1130768">But, the government contends that the Saving Clause, which is Section 406 (a), of the Immigration and National-- Naturalization Act keeps petitioner’s status the same as it was in the year that he signed the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.300" offset="1204537">There are a number of problems with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.603" offset="1209762">First of all, it’s inconsistent with the government’s general position that if petitioner had served, he would be eligible for citizenship because the Section 315 Act doesn’t apply to people who signed the exemption before 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.504" offset="1285413">Because you talked about a reply brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul N. Halvonik</label>
            <text syncTime="297.082" offset="1291682">Their reply brief, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.010" offset="1299414">That’s the only brief they filed. The filed other briefs in the Courts below, but I was referring to-- they have filed, but the one brief in-- the brief essentially relies on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.630" offset="1349883">I want to emphasize that that’s inconsistent with their general theory that if he’d served, he would be eligible for citizenship because if that Savings Clause saved all the disabilities of everybody, then it would save those who also served in the armed forces, and-- thus, Congress, in trying to create this new status in 1952 for people who was drafting, would be unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.429" offset="1449044">Now-- but, the inconsistency, I think, in the government’s position points out their misreading of Section 406 (a) in relation to Section 315, because Section 315 is an exception to the Savings Clause in Section 406 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="351.603" offset="1509752">Section 315 is meant to change status.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.690" offset="1518111">That’s what it’s there for.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.538" offset="1525530">It’s meant to change the series of invents that result in ineligibility for citizenship and add a new condition before one becomes ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.153" offset="1563982">That’s precisely what it’s for and it, therefore, is a specific exception to the Savings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.344" offset="1584776">It begins with the language “notwithstanding anything contained in Section 405 (b),” which is another Savings Clause that deals with the petitions for naturalization that are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.792" offset="1626572">And, the government takes the position that since there’s this “notwithstanding Section 405 (b)” language, therefore, Congress meant to leave Section 405 (a) as a continuing status controlling all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.665" offset="1698043">Well, that’s inconsistent with the case relied on by the government, Shomberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.014" offset="1711417">Shomberg also started out with “notwithstanding Section 405 (b)” language, didn’t refer specifically to Section 405 (a) but this Court said “well, it may well be that the ransom could’ve been more exact, but there was no question that since, in that case, Section 318 was designed specifically for this problem, it’s designed specifically to change status, that it was an exception to the Savings Clause” and, here, all you need to do is look at the language of Section 315 to see that it is supposed to have retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.836" offset="1842761">It refers to the past tense. It refers to those who have applied, in the past, for exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.959" offset="1867212">Moreover, I think, probably, Section 315 doesn’t have that much perspective impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.484" offset="1885288">Its main impact is retrospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.345" offset="1896782">There are a very few people under the change of the laws who could properly receive this exemption than they’ll ever be in a position to apply for citizenship or to acquire permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.112" offset="1951848">I think Section 315 is principally designed for cases such as that one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.991" offset="1967313">It’s principally designed for retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.546" offset="2001586">I won’t dwell too much longer on Section 315.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.493" offset="2009318">We have, in our brief, gone into some great length about the history of this exemption, about the history extending back to the Civil War of telling aliens “you can either accept the burdens of citizenship or not” and you make your decision and that’s that.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.375" offset="2072848">You’re released from the obligations of citizenship and you don’t get the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.309" offset="2092596">What 315 is designed to do is to take care of the people who did have the obligation imposed on them, of the citizen obligation of military service after they had signed the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.632" offset="2129899">That’s also relevant to our second contention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.711" offset="2158216">We contend in the brief there that petition didn’t make a knowing waiver of his eligibility for citizenship because he wasn’t apprised properly of the nature of the bargain he was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.934" offset="2203146">We rely there on the Moser case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.274" offset="2212446">In Moser it was held that though the alien had signed the exemption form, he would not be bound to it because he had been officially told by both the United States Government in this ligation that it didn’t really mean that he couldn’t become a citizen, and the Court here didn’t rely on the estoppel theory to say there wasn’t a knowing waiver of the eligibility because he wasn’t properly appraised of the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.302" offset="2316622">But, we say the same thing happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.845" offset="2322787">He wasn’t given any real choice because the choice was illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.827" offset="2342640">He wasn’t told really what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.472" offset="2353298">He was told “if you take this exemption, you will receive this benefit.”</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="566.218" offset="2368240">When you say he wasn’t told what was really going to happen, precisely what are you alluding to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_n_halvonik" startTime="572.027" stopTime="728.402">
            <label>Mr. Paul N. Halvonik</label>
            <text syncTime="572.027" offset="2391437">I’m alluding to the fact that he was told that he wouldn’t be able to become a citizen but he was also told that he would be released from liability for service in the armed forces, and best he made his choice looking at these two alternatives, but those alternatives, it turns out, weren’t real.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.079" offset="2459669">He wasn’t really getting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.264" offset="2464475">He wasn’t getting that release from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.436" offset="2473148">Now, the government says “well, it’s just a change in law, and that sort of happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.409" offset="2489031">When you enter into a bargain, you have to perhaps anticipate that somebody will change the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="602.656" offset="2514004">And, that may be a good argument where it’s a private contract but, here, the party that he made the agreement with was the government and it was that government that told him that he would not have to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.395" offset="2568965">He’d be released from liability for military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.708" offset="2578160">It was then the government, the very institution with which he made the agreement, that went back on the promise because the consideration was initially illusory and he was not given a fair opportunity to make a choice between the exemption of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.131" offset="2655901">I think it’s significant in Moser where this was referred to as a rule of elementary fairness, that the Court cited Johnson v. United States which is in 318 Unites States Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.717" offset="2706265">And, what happened in Johnson was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.853" offset="2714833">It was a matter that arose during a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.835" offset="2726745">The defendant had taken the stand and was testifying, and then tried to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination, and the judge permitted him to invoke that, although it was clear, at least in retrospect, then that, on appeal, he ruled improperly and shouldn’t have allowed the defendant to exercise any privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.329" offset="2820681">Nevertheless, the defendant did exercise his privilege, but then the Court permitted the prosecutor to comment upon it, and that was held error in the violation of the rule of elementary fairness for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.049" offset="2883584">Because he-- although he did get what he was told he would get, that is he was allowed to forgo testifying, he wasn’t told that the prosecutor would comment upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.013" offset="2923395">And, the Court said in Johnson, if he’d been told that this was going to happen, he might have acted very differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.763" offset="2950457">He would’ve then been presented with different sorts of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.009" offset="2963414">He might have made a different sort of judgment, and we can’t lead somebody out and not tell him all the facts then consistent with elementary fairness-- elemental fairness, hold him to his original position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.947" offset="5475140">That seems to be the significant factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.863" offset="5490813">The passage of time, of course, that relate back to this question about his physical change, the passage of time whenever you defer your military service, certain interesting things are likely to occur in between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.891" offset="5534908">It makes this kind of service you do different than it would’ve been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.838" offset="5550686">Now, these may be in your favor or they may not be in your favor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.914" offset="5566986">Lacher, for example, was a case that the government has sup-- says it was decided correctly in the Ninth Circuit, a man who applied for the exemption but actually served and got advantage of the two-pronged test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.508" offset="5613380">But, Lacher, it’s interesting to note, by postponing his induction was able to avoid the Korean War, which made life somewhat simpler for him, I should suppose. He didn’t go in when it was really a shooting war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.145" offset="5655907">Now this petition, on the other hand, had he passed the physical, would’ve been enduring the Korean War and he didn’t know he wasn’t going to pass his physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.786" offset="5682552">He wrapped up his life and it went down and tried to get into service, tried to recognize the obligation that was imposed by the order to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.785" offset="5738559">When a man actually serves after being-- after signing this exemption and being told that he won’t have to, the unfairness, the lack of the bargain here, the government’s not meeting its end of the bargain is obvious, just vividly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.252" offset="5796342">But, I can’t see where it’s any different when a man doesn’t serve because he can’t pass the physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.178" offset="5812120">He’s done everything in his power that he can possibly do to accept the obligation and to manifest his recognition of the obligations that he’s assumed now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.557" offset="5865618">It happens, in both cases, that the man does everything possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.214" offset="5876276">One man just physically isn’t able to enter the armed forces, and that can’t be a distinction between whether a man becomes a citizen or not, and the language of the statute doesn’t say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.234" offset="5928312">I submit that if Congress wanted only those people to be admitted to citizenship, who had entered the armed forces, it would’ve said “applied for the exemption and actually did not serve in the armed forces,” that those were people who were ineligible for citizenship, but it doesn’t say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.130" offset="5995917">It says “people who are ineligible for citizenship or people who want to sign the exemption until relieved from military liability,” and military liability is what petitioner had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.621" offset="6033847">He wasn’t relieved from that, and that’s the language of the statute and that’s the language that should control here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="1558.759" offset="6338435">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.723" offset="6354213">In the government’s view, this case raises essentially two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.914" offset="6371035">One, whether petitioner’s eligibility for citizenship is in fact governed by the Selective Service Act of 1948 or by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and, two, assuming that the 1952 Act applies, whether petitioner is nonetheless eligible for United States citizenship now by virtue of his having apply for and obtain an alien’s exemption from the draft in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.881" offset="6474898">I think both of these questions raise rather related and difficult issues of statutory interpretation of the 1952 Act and, without reiterating material that has already been gone over or that is familiar to this Court, I think it might be helpful right now if I very briefly place the 1952 statute in its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.160" offset="6560057">Under the Selective Service Act of 1948, as under the predecessor statute of 1940, an alien who applied for exemption from the draft on grounds of alienage was thereby permanently debarred from seeking citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.013" offset="6619408">Thus, when petitioner asked to have sought and obtained an alien’s exemption shortly before his scheduled induction in 1950 after having passed the physical examination for the draft, the sole test in the military service area of an alien’s eligibility for United States citizenship was in fact whether that alien had submitted a valid application for an exemption on grounds of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.987" offset="6715329">Now, I take it that all agree that if the 1948 Act is applicable to this case, Mr. Astrup is clearly ineligible for citizenship and I guess there can be no dispute of this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.680" offset="6758066">In view of this Court’s holding in Ceballos v. Shaughnessy in which a unanimous Court and an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan held that, under the 1948 Act, an alien-- exempt alien who subsequently loses his exemption, but like the petitioner here fails to pass a physical examination, continues to be ineligible for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.723" offset="6846255">Well then in June of 1951, as the Korean War grew in intensity, Congress did what it had done several times before during war time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.180" offset="6880110">It put increasing pressure on aliens residing in the United States to participate in the war effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.151" offset="6908008">In the case of permanent resident aliens, such as petitioner, Congress simply amended the Selective Service Act of 1948 to provide that permanent resident aliens were no longer eligible for draft exemptions on grounds of alienage, and this law affected both those aliens who had already sought and obtained alien’s exemptions and those who had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.534" offset="7001527">But, what about the citizenship status of those aliens who had in fact obtained alien’s exemptions which were no longer valid and who were now eligible theoretically, at least with respect to their alienage, to be called for military service?</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.063" offset="7063594">It certainly would have been possible, though by no means necessary, for Congress to have provided in the 1951 amendment for some sort of adjustment to the ineligibility for citizenship of those persons like petitioner who were no longer exempt by virtue of that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.401" offset="7132975">And I guess, in any event, it would’ve been logical for Congress to have said something, one way or the other, in the 1950 statute directly about the citizenship eligibility of those persons whose exemptions had been taken away by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.620" offset="7185847">But, Congress said nothing, that is nothing more than that permanent resident aliens were no longer exempt by virtue of their alienage, and I take it also that one day after that statute became effective and for at least the next year-and-a half until the effective date of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, no one doubted that the Selective Service Act of 1948 continued to govern the citizenship eligibility of those persons like petitioner and that, consequently those who had applied for alien’s exemptions continue to be debarred from seeking citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.973" offset="7331297">Then finally, in 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which is the statute that gives rise to the problems of this case and which, for the first time, incorporated the rules governing citizenship eligibility of aliens in a context other than the Selective Service Act, that is, the citizenship eligibility in its relationship to military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.372" offset="7432861">Now, as we know, the 1952 Act set out a somewhat different test of citizenship eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.870" offset="7454804">In the words of this Court in Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, a two-pronged test and that is the formulation that has been used ever since though it has never been clearly elaborated what exactly that test meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.971" offset="7499212">And, by that two-pronged test, an alien was debarred from seeking citizenship if he both applied for an alien’s exemption and “is or was relieved from service on such ground.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.501" offset="7549367">Now, again, it would certainly been possible for Congress at that time to have settled the question of citizenship eligibility for those whose exemptions had been removed by the 1951 amendment by specifying that the two-pronged test set out in the 1950 Act would be applied to those persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.931" offset="7623137">But, again, Congress did not specifically referred at all to that class of persons, like petitioner, who had applied for alien’s exemptions prior to the passage of the 1952 Act-- of the 1951 amendment that took that exemption away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.288" offset="7672560">Instead, what Congress did was to put a Savings Clause in the 1952 Act which is Section 405 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.595" offset="7705788">Printed now is a note to 8 USC 1101 which said that “unless otherwise specifically provided,” all preexisting conditions, rights, Acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters arising under prior law shall continue in effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="1990.875" offset="8066905">I think it is not unusual for Congress to place a statute like that both in the present and the past tense simply to be all inclusive and to make it unambiguous that it’s all inclusive at any time that it’s read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.509" offset="8117373">I think there’s an implication that it means to be retroactive with the respect-- with respect to the time that it’s enacted, but it isn’t necessarily so and, in Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, this question was raised and this Court did, indeed, specifically say that the Savings Clause was preserved intact and that the general language is or has applied did not apply to the petitioner in Ceballos v. Shaughnessy who is in an identical position, as I shall shortly elaborate, to the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.843" offset="8246732">The scheme is that, unless it is otherwise specifically provided, petitioner is debarred from citizenship arising under the Selective Service Act of 1948 and that, of course, that debarment is clearly a preexisting liability under Section 405 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.257" offset="8308381">It simply continues in effect and is unaffected by the test set out in Section 315, and this Court has held that the Savings Clause we are dealing with here is a very broad inclusive clause which has gotten around only with great difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.525" offset="8361462">In fact, as Mr. Justice Clark described Section 405 (a) in the Menasche case at 348 US, in which this Court very carefully examined the history of the Savings Clause is contained in the Immigration Act, and now I’m quoting from 348 US 535.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.494" offset="8421334">“The consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.114" offset="8475878">And, the implication of that Menasche case seems to be quite clearly that the Savings Clause of Section 405 (a) is applicable unless Congress makes a deliberate and specific statement of its intention to eliminate a preexisting right or liability, and Congress did not do that in Section 315 in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.892" offset="8546931">Appropriately, for our purposes here, what Congress did was to say that the Section 315 shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of Section 405 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.579" offset="8593638">Section 405 (b) is also a Savings Clause contained in the 1952 Act and it is significant to us, though not necessarily dispositive in light of other overwhelming evidence as this Court held in Shomberg, that Section 315 (a) does specifically accept 405 (b) but not 405 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.089" offset="8671692">With respect to 405 (a), we have only the general language of Section 315 which covers an alien who applies or has applied for an alien’s exemption and I think that the Ceballos case really closes considering that clause sufficiently, in general language, to override the Savings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.351" offset="8756746">As I say, the petitioner in Ceballos and Shaughnessy was virtually in a position virtually identical to that of petitioner for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.635" offset="8789870">He had filed his application for exemption before the date of the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.354" offset="8808782">The only difference here is that, in Ceballos, the procedural posture of the case was slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.371" offset="8832815">It involved a review of an order of deportation rather than a naturalization petition, so that another clause of Section 405 (a) involving proceedings to suspend deportation was brought into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.164" offset="8932080">And, the Court found that the general language of Section 315 was simply not a specific exemption to the Savings Clause of Section 405 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.894" offset="10726902">Now, I think it is very important to see exactly what language we’re dealing with in terms of this distinction between a person who has physically-- who has been relieved from physical service and a person who has actually served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.677" offset="10774131">Petitioner proposes that even though an alien who applies for an exemption on grounds of alienage is effectively and permanently relieved from service, that is he never serves in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.454" offset="10813210">He is not ineligible for citizenship if any other ground for exemption ultimately comes into play and contributes in any way that he’s permanently relieved from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.794" offset="10846542">In other words, though he doesn’t explicitly say this, he would read the phrase “relieved from service on such ground” as meaning relieved from service exclusively on grounds of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.843" offset="10886771">This would’ve been, of course, a rather radical departure from the 1948 statute which, arguably, wouldn’t even have saved him if he had served, but Congress certainly could’ve chosen to adopt this more generous position and to relieve from the consequences of their initial choice not to become citizens all citizens who applied for exemptions but were later exposed to theoretical liability for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.057" offset="10987604">As we have pointed out in our brief, it may be considered somewhat harsh, in fact, that Congress did not do so, though not for the reasons suggested by petitioner that the distinction is one of passing a physical examination because we consider that quite incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.117" offset="11047790">But, we do feel that there is, perhaps, something harsh in the fact that petitioner did, after all, originally make his election not to serve in the armed forces and not to become a citizen on the assumption that he would continue to enjoy the assurance of an alien’s exemption from the draft and he was, by no means, entitled to presume that Congress would not-- was foreclosed from removing his exemption.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="2864.220" offset="11560208">Would not apply for an alien’s exemption, that’s precisely the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.749" offset="11574418">That’s why I think that though we really have to take into account whether Congress-- since Section 315 is not after all crystal clear whether Congress intended to hold all aliens to their end of this so-called bargain, arrangement, those certainly with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.937" offset="11643068">I don’t think that, really, the harshness of our interpretation of Section 315, such as it is, would apply in a case where an alien had passed his physical examination originally and only decided to chose his alien’s exemption after the fact of knowing he was physically fit for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.407" offset="11749021">In fact, several Courts of Appeals have made related arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.961" offset="11763231">Every Court of Appeals that has decided this precise issue has, in fact, decided in the government’s favor and several have pointed out, in connection with this issue, that many things can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.747" offset="11806386">An alien can assess his chances of getting an exemption on some other ground that would not debar him from citizenship before he chooses to claim his alien’s exemption, and then he may later loose that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.848" offset="11854764">But, in the interim period, many things that could happen that would change his draft status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.806" offset="11874617">Things like marriage at one point, occupational defermance or illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.926" offset="11899068">Any of those things can happen during the period when he holds his exemption from the draft which might provide him with permanent relief from the draft that he would not have had but for his original choice of an alien’s exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.944" offset="11947133">With respect to this petitioner, even if this Court were to take, let’s say, an intermediate position with respect to Section 315 that the alien doesn’t have to have been relieved exclusively on grounds of alienage but that, somehow, the government must show that alienage was the substantial or even the major factor contributing to his ultimate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.974" offset="12035218">Petitioner can’t withstand that test either, I don’t think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.113" offset="12059773">In any event, we, on balance, feel that the language of Section 315 is quite badly strained by a construction that his release from alienage must rest exclusively on grounds of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.088" offset="12099688">We feel that a more normal reading of that language which refers to an alien who is or was relieved from service, not from liability but from service, on grounds of alienage is that, as long as the alien’s exemption was one of the grounds contributing to his effective and permanent relief from service, he has been relieved on such ground within the meaning of Section 315.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.870" offset="12186833">We think this reading is far more in line with Congress’ attitude as expressed in the prior legislation, and we think that that prior legislation, the basic concepts of that legislation, were meant to be retained in the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.441" offset="12237093">And, for that reason, we ask that this Court affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3039.251" stopTime="3043.606">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3039.251" offset="12260394">Thank you, Mr. Stone.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul N. Halvonik</label>
            <text syncTime="3043.606" offset="12277844">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.315" offset="12284635">Let me just go to the last point that was raised there on what happens with this interim period if you’ve got to postponement of the period for induction in the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.303" offset="12324551">That obviously can cut both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.908" offset="12331029">If you take a-- if you have an opportunity to postpone your induction and you do it during peace time then find yourself called two years later and there’s a war, obviously it’s a less congenial setting for entering into the armed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.567" offset="12389648">But, this man didn’t set out to postpone anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.086" offset="12399679">The arraignment he was given was that he wasn’t going to be drafted and said he was relieved from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.229" offset="12424338">He wasn’t going to consider whether his physical state was going to change and 231 doesn’t expect, in the next couple of years, to be physically unfit for service anyway, but that didn’t enter into his thinking at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.326" offset="12464671">The arraignment was you’re never going to be a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.494" offset="12477315">On the other hand, you’ll never have this obligation of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.286" offset="12488495">Never have the obligation, not that it’s postponed, but that it’s extinguished, that that’s a job for citizens and you’re not going to be one, and he didn’t have any theoretical liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.687" offset="12526111">He was actually called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.437" offset="12533112">He had to change his life, wrap up his business, go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.484" offset="12545337">He was all prepared to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.798" offset="12554533">And, in doing that action, he demonstrated as much as he was possible to demonstrate that he was willing to assume that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.690" offset="12582118">He demonstrated it to the same extent as those who passed physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.791" offset="12602493">Now, one other point raised by Mr. Stone was whether the Section 405 (a) Savings Clause is applicable to Section 315 by virtue of the Ceballos decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.582" offset="12669680">He’s referring to footnote 17 in Ceballos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.654" offset="12689951">Ceballos, as I noted before, was a 1951 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.320" offset="12700609">The 1952 statute was held applicable to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.069" offset="12715656">There’s also a note that says that this-- the procedures initiated against him for deportation were saved by the clause and, therefore, even if he’d come afterwards he probably wouldn’t be able to stop the deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.357" offset="12776782">It’s a Shomberg case, and that’s what the reference is to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.077" offset="12791724">It’s true, there’s nothing in Section 315 that specifically changes any procedures that would be going against you at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.933" offset="12823071">There is no procedural specific exception to the prior law, so that if a procedure had been begun against the petitioner, for example, for deportation, it would be beside the point that he had a new status after 1952 because he couldn’t take advantage of it because the proceedings for deportation would go pursuant to the 1948 law, but what Section 315 does do specifically is change the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.901" offset="12922964">It doesn’t change procedures, but it changes status, and it makes eligible for citizenship those who were not eligible before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.010" offset="12951385">And, we submit, that the reason Congress did that was because it was not living up to its prior bargain and now it tried to meet its obligation, and it has retroactive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.386" offset="12992867">It seems the most reasonable thing in the world for Congress to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.881" offset="13006869">It seems the fairest thing for Congress to do and it’s very hard to explain the language as applied, as Mr. Justice White pointed out, without applying this thing retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.374" offset="13060890">Finally, I again point out, as Mr. Justice White did, the government’s position is totally inconsistent as to those who actually served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.642" offset="13089938">Either 1952 applies retroactively or it doesn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.007" offset="13103417">It can’t apply retroactively to people who passed physicals and not apply retroactively to people who flunk physicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.954" offset="13135182">Thank you.</text>
