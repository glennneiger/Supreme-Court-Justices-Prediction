            <text syncTime="31.333" offset="125283">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.423" offset="129672">My name is Joseph Levin.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.349" offset="137300">I represent the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.646" offset="154540">The association is made up of some 4400 members who are engaged in the securities business and a great majority of them sell mutual fund shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.946" offset="207726">At issue here is an order of exemption entered by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.189" offset="244715">And that order enabled the first National City Bank to go into the mutual fund business.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.063" offset="272196">At the outset, I would like to emphasize the fact that the Commission has washed its hands of its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.017" offset="312007">The Commission, we believe for the first time in its history has refused to appear in support of the Commission order.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.911" offset="347638">Furthermore, the Commission in its response to the petition for writ of certiorari which we filed stated, there's no assurance that the Commission would reach the same judgment for similar matter is again presented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph B. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="105.797" offset="423184">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.541" offset="426109">The explanation for the Commission position appears in the brief of the United States as amicus curiae on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.774" offset="475011">The statement there is that only two of the members of the Commission who participated in this case remain as members of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.129" offset="508447">One of whom supported the decision and one of whom dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.114" offset="524434">The three subsequently appointed members of the Commission are not prepared to take any position.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.853" offset="547318">Accordingly, the Commission expresses no position on the merits and urges neither affirmance nor reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.198" offset="596741">In this setting with the agency taking the position that it does, the Court asserts here to accept this agency expertise which for all practical purposes, at least the present commission has disowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.182" offset="656718">I might also point out that two of the three judges in the Court of Appeals relied upon administrative expertise in reaching their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.455" offset="697783">The third judge also affirmed the order of the Commission, did consider the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.878" offset="735504">The question presented involves Section 6(c) and Section 10(c) of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.528" offset="766015">Section 10(c) provides and I quote that “no registered investment company shall have a majority of its Board of directors consisting of persons who are officers or directors of one bank.”</text>
            <text syncTime="205.118" offset="820454">As I shall more fully develop later, this was a prophylaxis described to deal with the conflicts of interest problem resulting from the Investment Company commercial bank interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.133" offset="880431">And the prophylaxis resulted from a record of gross abuse in the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.775" offset="907076">Here, the Bank has created an investment company which it operates and manages and as the commission acknowledged, there are potential conflicts of interest between the Bank and its commercial banking activities and the investment company.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="242.990" offset="971860">Is the investment company incorporated?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_b_levin" startTime="246.020" stopTime="560.541">
            <label>Mr. Joseph B. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="246.020" offset="983980">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.168" offset="996624">Well, it’s an investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.061" offset="1008222">Under the Investment Company Act, the question of whether or not it is an Investment Company Act is not raised in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.284" offset="1041136">In fact, the particular account has registered under the Investment Company Act as an open-ended investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.418" offset="1081574">The question presented here is whether in these circumstances that is where there are potential conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.439" offset="1117727">The commission may grant the bank an exemption from 10(c) by invoking Section 6(c) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.366" offset="1149388">Section 6(c) permits the Commission to grant an exemption from any provision of the statute and I quote “If into the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purpose is fairly intended by the policies and provisions of this title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="308.990" offset="1235905">Before considering the policy of the statute, its provisions, I’d very briefly like to describe this particular investment company which is called a commingled investment account.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.448" offset="1297763">At the time of the SEC proceedings, the account had not yet come into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.779" offset="1315109">It has now come into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.066" offset="1324199">The account as I've said is registered under the investment company as an open-end investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.691" offset="1354710">Its objectives are the investments in common stock and convertibles which offer the opportunity for long-term growth of capital and income, a prospect offered generally by investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.117" offset="1424405">It is an open-ended investment company or a mutual fund because it stands ready to redeem its shares at net asset value and it makes a continuing offering on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.233" offset="1468918">The participations in this particular mutual fund are called units and the minimum initial participation is $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.612" offset="1510400">There is no sales charged when an investor buys in to the fund and in that respect, the fund is like the no load sales -- no load investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.980" offset="1563899">The account uses an arrangement common to mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.966" offset="1579781">It is managed by an investment adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.098" offset="1588349">In this case, the Bank serves that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.997" offset="1599948">The Bank maintains a continuous investment program for the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.952" offset="1619801">It determines what securities are to be bought and sold and executes those transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.042" offset="1644147">For its services, the bank receives an annual fee equal to one half of 1% of the average net asset value of the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.321" offset="1681241">This is a type and amount of fee that’s customary in the mutual fund business.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.187" offset="1704647">Operation of the account is subject to the supervision of a committee which is annually elected by the participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.405" offset="1733590">This committee is -- under the statute is the equivalent of the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.263" offset="1756996">And it was this Board of Directors for which the commission granted the exemption from Section 10(c) with one commissioner dissenting as I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.728" offset="1802867">The Board has five members, three of whom are officers of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.534" offset="1830034">The account is subject to the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.936" offset="1847693">This particular type of operation did not become permissible until the comptroller adopted certain regulations in 1963 and validity of those regulations is the subject of Number 61 which is to be argued after this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.147" offset="1928568">Now, as far as Section 6(c) of the Act is concerned, it was intended for persons who were not within the intendment of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.048" offset="1976111">Now, the commission in its decision here referred to its traditional standards and that it relies upon in invoking Section 6(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="506.073" offset="2024281">And as the Commission put it, the propriety of granting an exemption largely depends upon the purposes of the section from which an exemption is requested, the evils against which it is directed and the end which it seeks to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.164" offset="2088647">And then it continued with saying that the showing required in order to meet the standards set forth in Section 6(c), as the compliance from which exemption is sought is not necessary to accomplish the Acts’ objectives and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.121" offset="2148415">Our position here is that the action of the Commission does contravene the policy and objectives of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.270" offset="2184986">The Investment Company Act resulted from a comprehensive study of investment companies which the commission made and the Commission itself initiated the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.218" offset="2236813">That study revealed --</text>

            <text syncTime="663.501" offset="2653936">This study that the SEC conducted which led to the passage of the Investment Company Act revealed a history of abuse on the part of insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.893" offset="2703569">And a paramount purpose of the statute was to treat with the conflicts of interest problem particularly as it relates to investment company officers and directors and their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.776" offset="2751007">Section 10(c) is part of the statutory arsenal that is directed at that conflicts problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.121" offset="2780473">To contend with the conflicts problem, the statute contains a variety of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.261" offset="2805029">It prohibits self-dealing by insiders in very, very broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.971" offset="2823837">It restricts agency transactions by insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.507" offset="2837943">It imposes fiduciary obligations on investment company managements.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.211" offset="2856751">It provides for pervasive supervision by the Commission of Investment Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.872" offset="2879425">In that respect, it provides for periodic examinations by the Commission of Investment Companies, for detailed filings by investment companies with respect to their operations and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.648" offset="2926550">And lastly, it also provides for civil and criminal enforcement measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.139" offset="2948493">But the statute went one step further in terms of dealing with the conflicts of interest problem and felt that the imposition of fiduciary duties, prohibition of self dealing and commission supervision and inspection was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.849" offset="3031353">In Section 10, which the commission has described as a keystone provision of a statute and which during the congressional hearings on the legislation was referred to as a double barrel protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.232" offset="3088927">The statute rather imposes certain restrictions on the composition of the board of directors of an investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.581" offset="3134276">Apart from the restriction on commercial bankers in Section 10(c), it also places restriction on membership by investment bankers, by the investment company’s principal underwriter, by its regular broker, by its investment advisor, and by people that are affiliated with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.723" offset="3214838">Now turning specifically to Section 10(c), to use the language of one of the Commission's Spokesman during the congressional hearings, it was the consequence of horrible examples of abuse in the bank dominated investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.951" offset="3283801">The legislative history which is fully set forth in our brief bristles with passages that condemn that particular interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.737" offset="3318909">For example, commission spokesman in justifying the provisions of Section 10(c) during the course of the congressional hearings made the following observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.818" offset="3359242">There were very undesirable consequences flowing from the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.356" offset="3381394">Some worst examples of abuses, we had in the whole study arose out of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.526" offset="3406054">The conflicts problem becomes more acute in the case of the commercial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.476" offset="3425802">The public’s funds are used to further the banking business of the insider.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.078" offset="3444297">The congressional concern as it was expressed in the Senate report that accompanied the legislation, was the concern with the unscrupulous banks who advanced their own pecuniary interest at the expense of investment companies and their security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.906" offset="3511589">Indeed, the question in 1940 was not how little but rather how much should be done to restrict the bank interlock and indeed whether it should be permitted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.230" offset="3564878">And that Section 10(c) was viewed as a minimum safeguard for there were those who advocated the complete segregation of commercial banks from investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.172" offset="3616601">For that matter, that position was even advocated by commercial bankers themselves in light of their unhappy experiences during the 20’s in terms of conflicts in the operations of bank sponsored investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.279" offset="3677100">And particularly significant in this regard is the observation of Senator Robert Wagner who is Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee after the commission had put in its testimony, he made the observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.775" offset="3739063">I think it would be better if the Board were free of any kind of influence from bankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.936" offset="3763722">Of course, I know that is ideal and that we are not going to get that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.330" offset="3781277">But then there would be no chance about their loyalty being consciously or subconsciously only to their investment trust rather than to outside interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.655" offset="3822550">The commission explained 10(c) in saying that it viewed 10(c) as a middle of the road approach -- as a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.730" offset="3862883">It was put as instead of having complete segregation of commercial bankers, an attempt was made to permit it and then just circumscribe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.276" offset="3905097">The statutory concern with bank domination of investment companies is not only limited to Section 10(c) but it’s further manifested in Section 10 (h) (2) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.921" offset="3959641">That Section deals with the type of Investment Company that does not have a Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.010" offset="3983987">Section 10 (h) (2) provides that the investment advisor to such a company must satisfy the standards of Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.483" offset="4025887">A bank thus could not be an investment advisor to one of these companies that does not have a board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.385" offset="4057443">In other words, under the statute, a bank may only serve as an investment advisor, if there's a buffer of board of directors meeting the provisions of Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.713" offset="4110838">In our view, it is unmistakable that Section 10(c) was intended as a minimum invest to protection certainly where there are potential conflicts of interest and now turning to the matter of the conflicts of interest that exist in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.762" offset="4187011">As I've indicated, the commission acknowledged that there are potential conflicts of interest here which could arise as a result of the bank’s commercial banking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.356" offset="4233404">In fact, one of the spokesmen for the banking industry recently in urging the amendment of Section 10, acknowledged the fact that the conflicts problem is inherent in the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.289" offset="4285127">And in a situation such as is involved here where the bank has control of the day-to-day management of the Investment Company where the free reign in the conduct of its operations, a conflicts problem emerges probably as sharply as it ever could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.033" offset="4360046">The only aspects of the problem of the conflicts problem to which the SEC addressed itself were those that it itself had referred to, in 1963 in urging that the Section 10 prophylaxis was necessary for the type of arrangement that’s involved in this commingled agency account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.027" offset="4848013">It permits the Commission to exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.138" offset="4860552">It permits the Commission to grant various types of orders necessary in the public interest and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.483" offset="4885838">However, it withheld or the statute withholds that type of specific statutory authority -- exemptive authority or molding authority in Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.964" offset="4939755">And in fact, the legislative hearing show that it was intended in Section 10 not to provide flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.203" offset="4984790">What we have here though is a residual authority that the Congress granted in Section 6(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.755" offset="5018958">In that authority, the Congress said if you -- if there is a situation that isn’t within the intent of the legislation, it isn’t the kind of situation in which the evils of the statute are directed, doesn’t fall within the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.142" offset="5072562">In those circumstances, you may grant an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.242" offset="5116865">As I say, the only aspects of the problem to which the commission addressed itself were those conflicts that in itself had emphasized, in 1963 congressional hearings in urging that the Section 10 prophylaxis was necessary for the type of arrangement that are here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.730" offset="5186873">And the conflicts which the commission referred to and they are four in number, is the danger that the bank might retain an unwarranted portion of the assets of the bank sponsored fund in cash in order to earn money for the bank. Secondly, that banks distribute brokerage according to a formula which rewards those brokerage who keep balances in the bank or have other dealings with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.872" offset="5303484">This policy, the Commission pointed out in ’63 could lead to excessive portfolio turnover or to a fund not receiving maximum benefit from its brokerage business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.468" offset="5349773">Thirdly, that fund investments could be used to shore up bank loans and fourthly, that bankers or underwriters and dealers and various kinds of Government bonds that they might use the fund as a place to place those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.982" offset="5411840">Now, these aren’t the only conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.314" offset="5421244">These are the ones that the commission addressed itself to, there are others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.961" offset="5439843">For example, a bank may use the Investment Company as a bird hock (ph) that is it may have the fund make an investment in the company in the hopes or in order to get the commercial banking business of the particular company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.933" offset="5527719">There's also a companion problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.652" offset="5542557">The nature of which was alluded to in the congressional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.060" offset="5560216">The situation of where a fund holds securities of a company which is an important commercial banking customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.539" offset="5594070">And the sale would appear to be advisable but the sale would depress the market price, something that the company managements don’t like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.516" offset="5630015">The question is whether in those circumstances, the bank would be able or the bank directors would be able to look at the matter of the disposition of that investment with an eye singled to the interest of the fund or would his thinking be concerned by the impact on the commercial banking customer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.075" offset="6504281">And by the SEC’s own standards for the application of Section 6(c), an exemption is therefore improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.718" offset="6538867">Now, the Commission did attempt to rationalize an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.142" offset="6568542">And we submit of course, that the analysis is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.586" offset="6594247">First and what is an unusual stance for the commission in administering this remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.326" offset="6625280">The commission endeavored to restrict the intent and scope of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.554" offset="6650149">Although the statute speaks in terms of no registered investment company, the commission said Congress really didn’t mean it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.461" offset="6681809">And in this regard -- it also pointed out that this account did not become permissible until 1963 with the new comptroller's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.156" offset="6732591">And in terms of endeavoring to find a basis to distinguish it -- this particular fund, it said that the fund was different from the bank dominated investment companies that were described in the commission's study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.802" offset="6799151">Now as far as the account not becoming permissible until 1963, I submit that that’s irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.890" offset="6831543">In the account’s pursed after 1940 doesn’t negate the potentials for conflict and that’s what is the statute’s concern under Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.785" offset="6883056">Insofar as the commission looked to the bank affiliates of the 20’s and tried to find identity, the commission’s own study in describing these bank affiliate says and I quote that “these affiliates acted as investment companies in buying and selling securities for an investment for speculative purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.977" offset="6991830">It was for this reason that Section 10(c) was enacted and it is precisely this function that the account or this bank sponsor mutual fund will engage in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.572" offset="7082214">That’s right and what I am saying is that one of the functions of those bank securities affiliates in the 20’s as described in the commission study was that those affiliates among other things engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for investment or speculative purposes and it was because they engaged in that particular activity in the investment company business that they became subject to the Investment Company Act and Section 10(c) was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.334" offset="7221290">In any event, the statute itself patently rejects this commission approach that the application of Section 10(c) turns on whether a particular company has a kinship to the bank affiliates of the 1920’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.189" offset="7296731">And I refer specifically to Section 10(d) of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.376" offset="7329437">10(d) deals with the so-called no load companies that are managed by investment counselors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.212" offset="7364754">Now, those companies at a special situation, those companies are granted the matter of exemptions from Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.090" offset="7396310">It was considered for those companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.913" offset="7407595">These are open-end companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.451" offset="7417731">A matter of exemptions for those companies was specifically considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.825" offset="7439256">They were granted certain exemptions from 10(a) and from 10(b), the companies have no kinship to the Bank securities affiliates of the 1920’s but Congress specifically withheld an exemption from 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.871" offset="7495471">And it’s particularly interesting that in so called 10(d) company, the no load company, there is less of a chance of the potential conflicts of interest because by hypothesis, those companies cannot be managed by banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.983" offset="7567882">Furthermore, the broad provision of Section 10(c) is such that it reaches to all types of investment companies for example, I referred already to the so called 10 (h) (2) company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.436" offset="7621695">The company that doesn’t have a board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.932" offset="7631726">Congress said we want 10(c) to apply there where it can and furthermore it applies to face amounts of certificate companies which had absolutely no kinship or identity with the bank security affiliates of the 1920’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.597" offset="7698286">Now, the Commission did attempt to come to grips with the conflicts problem and what it said was that there were substantial safeguards here against conflicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.244" offset="8608914">As was remarked earlier, this is one of two related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.570" offset="8634201">But I think there is one respect in which they were not quite correctly described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.602" offset="8658338">It is true as I understand it that if the case to be argued tomorrow, the ICI case should be reversed, then this case seizes to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.020" offset="8704000">But on the other hand Justice Stewart, even if the exemption should be held improper which of course we denied, then the ICI case still would be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.916" offset="8743602">First, because Regulation 9 is an issue in the ICI case and because there is some reason to believe that it would be possible to operate managing agency commingled investment accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.836" offset="8803265">Even so, there were no exemptions from Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.894" offset="8819566">That’s a moot point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.533" offset="8826044">I don’t mean to say the exemption isn’t important but it isn't quite accurate to say that if it were denied, that would be the end of the managing agency commingled investment account, speaking of them as a category not of this particular plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.256" offset="9193012">There are two general observations which I think are pertinent to both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.241" offset="9220911">In the first place, it’s important not to slip into such question begging characterizations as mutual fund, Investment Company, securities business are on our side, fiduciary relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.273" offset="9285068">The real question here is which is the right characterization?</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.838" offset="9303249">And of course, the right characterization depends upon examination of what it is that the Bank is actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.957" offset="9339820">Second, the right characterization has been decided in these cases by the expert agencies unanimously, in favor of the view that what the Bank is doing is performing a traditional fiduciary banking function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.541" offset="9418083">In a way, that preserves the fiduciary relationship and which is in the public interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.311" offset="9445146">This is a view supported not only by the comptroller but by the Federal Reserve Board both in its ruling given to City Bank and in its testimony before Congress by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company, by the New York Banking Authorities in parallel situations and to the extent that it was pertinent under the Investment Company Act by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.217" offset="9544829">And so here, the question I think is not as Mr. Levin’s argument suggests whether the commission could properly exempt an ordinary Investment Company from Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.838" offset="9607314">But rather, it’s whether the commission made a permissible expert judgment, when it concluded that this is not the kind of Investment Company with which the purpose of Section 10(c) was primarily concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.001" offset="9667918">But as I say, a fiduciary banking activity which could be exempted without departing from the purposes or policy of the Act and which should be exempted in the public interest that the commission was correct in that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.906" offset="9735523">But it becomes apparent when one goes behind the labels and looks at the development of the commingled investment account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.705" offset="9770736">And to do that, it’s really necessary to go back to 1913 when Section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act gave the Federal Reserve Board a power to issue to national banks, permits to act in sundry fiduciary capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.696" offset="9842730">The present language of then modifications is set forth at page 1(a) of our brief and it describes these powers as the right to act as trustee, executer, administrator and so forth or over on the next page, in any other fiduciary capacity in which State Banks can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.473" offset="9921829">And there's no doubt that State Banks could act in this capacity under the law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.101" offset="9952340">Under this Section, banks have of course long activities, trustees, executives, guardians and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.034" offset="9988075">They’ve also acted as agents to keep custody in a customer’s assets, securities and to give him advice concerning investments with the customer retaining the final decision whether to change his securities.</text>
