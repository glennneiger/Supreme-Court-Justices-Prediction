            <text syncTime="6.152" offset="24555">Very well.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Judson W. Detrick</label>
            <text syncTime="12.522" offset="50051">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.183" offset="60709">The second question raised by this Court’s grant on the writ of certiorari was the question of the retroactivity of O’Callahan v. Parker and it's our submission that O’Callahan v. Parker is precisely the kind of case that should be given full retroactive application so as to apply to petitioner’s conviction even though it became final within the military appellate system some six years prior to this Court’s decision O’Callahan v. Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.534" offset="202083">The Court has laid down a series of three criteria for determining the question of retroactivity significantly in Linkletter v. Walker and Stovall v. Deno.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.913" offset="259553">Those three criteria are the purposes of the decision in question the reliance by law enforcement authorities on this standard existing prior to the substantive decision and the impact on the administration of justice of the retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.222" offset="336875">Now, in the context of these three criteria the court has often stated that the crucial question is whether the proscribed activity infects the integrity of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.876" offset="395494">I would submit that the very heart of the court martial system is in question in O’Callahan and that was its power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.512" offset="433946">I think that the integrity of the process by which O’Callahan and petitioner were convicted is no less impugned by his conviction for a crime that the court had no power to try and convict him for then for his conviction for a crime he did not commit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.305" offset="517120">In both cases, the defect in his conviction goes to the very center of the legal -- of its legal justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.621" offset="550452">Now I think the court’s emphasis on the integrity of the fact-finding process is merely and often articulated aspect of its general concern that any conviction be the product of a fundamentally fair proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.664" offset="626625">I do not think that the court necessarily only means, it's very important that they are protecting against the risk of the conviction of the innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.708" offset="682736">Now I would cite the Court to its case in the Witherspoon v. Illinois where the Court refused to find that the jury selection standards in that case which excluded the jurors who were opposed to capital punishment from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.909" offset="771553">The Court refused to find that that’s substantially increased the risk of conviction and yet the court -- conviction of the innocent and yet the court went on to find that the integrity of the fact-finding process by which that accused was convicted was necessarily undermined by that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.010" offset="855980">And the court went on to give Witherspoon v. Illinois full retroactive application despite any considerations of reliance by law enforcement authorities or the impact on the administration of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.467" offset="905822">Well, if you prevail on the merits, your retroactivity point is stronger than that, isn’t it? It was tried by tribunal where there’s no business trying it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Judson W. Detrick</label>
            <text syncTime="237.798" offset="951171">Yes, Your Honor and I think that is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.234" offset="964859">Now the respondent --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="242.264" stopTime="245.350">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="242.264" offset="969038">That is if you prevail?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Judson W. Detrick</label>
            <text syncTime="245.350" offset="981368">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.204" offset="992758">Respondent submits that the case should be given partial retroactive application only and that it should not apply to convictions that became final within the military appellate system prior to this Court’s decision in O’Callahan which was June 2 of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.046" offset="1076140">In part, their position is based upon this Court’s decision in DeStefano v. Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.364" offset="1105398">In DeStefano, the Court found that the cases of Duncan v. Louisiana and Bloom v. Illinois, which imposed the jury trial requirements on the States should not be given retroactive application -- general retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.191" offset="1168718">Now respondent maintains that the same reasoning applies in this case as applied in that case I submit that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.932" offset="1203722">First of all, the Constitutional provision involved in this case, respondent would be saying the Sixth Amendment should not be determinative of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.223" offset="1256803">In each case the peculiarities of the decision and substantive decision should be looked at closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.192" offset="1292748">Now I feel further more that O’Callahan does involve more than DeStefano involve and that O’Callahan involves a determination that the Court has no subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.974" offset="1351889">So it was not the case in DeStefano v. Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.888" offset="1367458">Such a determination necessarily as I’ve already pointed out goes to the very heart of the court martial process itself and does infect the integrity of fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.086" offset="1412284">In fact despite any references to whether the court martial processes at whole is more fair or less fair than a civilian process.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.362" offset="1481352">I would submit that any trial and conviction of someone by a court we have no jurisdiction or the subject matter is unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.553" offset="1518132">Furthermore, I think that O’Callahan involve more and simply the right of trial by jury and the right to grand jury indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.273" offset="1557002">I think O’Callahan involved the right to trial by jury in a civilian court with all the tenet differences between civilian courts and military courts, and I think that this Courts opinion in O’Callahan points that fact out.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.654" offset="1618547">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="439.405" offset="1757518">Respondent also places great emphasis on the factors of reliance by law enforcement authorities and the impact on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.136" offset="1800464">so I would like to point out that this Court has often held that when the purposes of a decision do favor it's retroactive application which I would submit the purpose of O’Callahan due to the factors of reliance and at the impact on the administration of justice are not significant and are not to be taken into consideration because only when the purpose is ambiguous as to whether it favors retroactivity or not that those two considerations are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.322" offset="1925224">Furthermore, I would like to state that the reliance factor on the O’Callahan is certainly not as strong as the reliance factor existing in many of the decisions of this Court. My time is up.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.065" offset="2144235">In one case, the 14-year old sister of a serviceman who was visiting his wife who had just given birth to a child in the Army Hospital at Fort Dix.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.177" offset="2192614">And in the other case, the wife of a member of the Air Force stationed at Mc Guire Air Force Base immediately adjacent to Fort Dix and employed on the base.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.954" offset="2347781">These were crimes of violence involving kidnapping and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.655" offset="2370560">Rape is specifically made a crime under Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and kidnapping was -- the charge of kidnapping was brought under the so-called General Article -- Article 134.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.430" offset="2457704">.Both the rape and the kidnapping occurred on the military reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.047" offset="2492186">A radical change, I think it may be fairly said, was introduced in this law in this area by this Court’s decision in O’Callahan against Parker decided on June 2, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.255" offset="2568986">That decision left in it's wake many undecided and uncertain questions which the military lawyers and the Court of Military Appeals have been working hard to resolve until other cases can be brought forward like this one for guiding light from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.456" offset="2657802">One of the problems of course the retroactive application of the O’Callahan decision to which I will turn later in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.505" offset="2702002">Of immediate concern however, to the lawyers who are responsible for the administration of military justice, are such questions as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.689" offset="2750694">Not all of which are involved in this case but I want to list them as some of the problems in order to put this case in a larger setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.983" offset="2799909">In the first place the standard setup in the O’Callahan case is service connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.147" offset="2836584">What is service connection?</text>
            <text syncTime="713.115" offset="2852362">Is it enough if in this country the offense occurs on a military reservation and is committed by a serviceman?</text>
            <text syncTime="722.552" offset="2890188">Does that apply to all offenses including fraud, bad checks and so on or only the crimes of violence?</text>
            <text syncTime="733.348" offset="2933342">And if so, what crimes under what circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="739.435" offset="2957688">And enlarging somewhat on that, is there any way that there can be a sure simple test or standard of this or must it be resolved case by case someway trying to workout the fact of each case as to whether there is enough here to make it service connected or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="757.863" offset="3031353">The latter of course obviously, involving great difficulty and frequent reconsideration through appeals habeas corpus and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.395" offset="3085479">Can a court martial try an offense which occurs off a military reservation in any case?</text>
            <text syncTime="778.124" offset="3112438">For example, an assault by one serviceman on another in a non-public -- in a public non-military place.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.089" offset="3152353">And then another question of great importance, can there be a waiver of the right not to be tried by court martial?</text>
            <text syncTime="796.585" offset="3186312">For example the serviceman in a city, near his base in a southern state might be charged with an offense with racial overtones.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.130" offset="3232496">He might much prefer to be tried by court martial and the local authorities might be willing.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.329" offset="3261231">Can this be done with his consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="819.087" offset="3276278">If the court martial has no jurisdiction, it may be hard to support a waiver --</text>

            <text syncTime="864.488" offset="3457881">Suppose a navy ship coast at Norfolk and crew was given shore leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.900" offset="3479510">While in the city, one of the men gets involved in a drunken brawl, there are injuries but no one is killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.892" offset="3507513">The ship is under orders to leave the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.119" offset="3524441">The city authorities will turn the man over to the navy if the navy will really try him for the offense, the man is willing.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.192" offset="3560699">The navy needs him and can use him despite the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.457" offset="3577731">He may have an important assignment on the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.486" offset="3593927">Can the navy try him in such circumstances? Suppose that all of the witnesses are likewise members of the same crew and note too the civilian punishment might be a certain number of months in jail while the navy can be much more flexible with such punishments as reduction in grade, extra duty or weekends in the brig which may be effective in many cases and less disruptive of the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.088" offset="3728300">And then there's the whole area abroad, can there be a court martial for any offense committed abroad whether on or off a military reservation, whether against military personnel or civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.730" offset="3786919">Note that generally speaking no question or right to trial by jury is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.716" offset="3810847">In certain cases, the status of forces treaties are in effect under which we can turn the man over to the foreign authorities but suppose there is no such treaty or the foreign authorities do not want to try the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.803" offset="3875109">Can he be validly tried by the court martial against his objection?</text>
            <text syncTime="974.502" offset="3897992">The alternatives may be to turn also such offenders to the local authorities which may mean trial by an alien system and punishment which would not meet with approval here.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.043" offset="3952118">All of these questions and more have been left in uncertainty since the O’Callahan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.383" offset="3985450">This Court’s guidance is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.092" offset="4008333">The problems arise not only in the matters of current trials for offenses committed after the O’Callahan decision and in habeas corpus with respect to past convictions but also in suits for various collateral remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.180" offset="4076669">Such as back pay restoration, to arraign, correction of military records, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.817" offset="4151171">And now let me turn to the particular problem presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.332" offset="4177293">There are as far as I know only two constitutional provisions which shed any light on this problem other than the provisions of Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the extent that they are not made inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.269" offset="4245002">These two constitutional provisions are Article 1, Section 8, Clause 14 and the except clause in the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.205" offset="4312816">Yes Mr. Justice but that was pretty much read out of this area in the cases Reid and Covert in the later cases and I don’t want to throw away anything that any member of the Court thinks is useful to our side but I don’t particularly rely on the Necessary and Proper Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.196" offset="4400692">I don’t see how it can expand the field within which Clause 14 gives power although it can certainly affect the way in which that power is exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.980" offset="4471850">Clause 14 expressly gives to Congress the power to make rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.785" offset="4503092">And it is of course as much a part of Constitution as are the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.219" offset="4528797">And the second excepts “cases arising in the land of naval Forces” from the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment showing that the framers of the Fifth Amendment two years after the Constitution went into effect where did not think they were restricting the power that had been granted by Clause 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.466" offset="4641855">The whole structure of military justice rests on this and it was this provisions which the court construed and applied in the O’Callahan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.910" offset="4687621">They are obviously quite general and quite a lot can be read into them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.848" offset="4715311">Obviously O’Callahan read less into them than have previously been supposed but how much and on what basis and principles is not yet wholly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.604" offset="4778318">Since June 2, 1969 a considerable number of cases have come before the Court of Military Appeals which has the responsibility in the first instance of trying to work these matters off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.278" offset="4845087">These decisions are summarized on pages 6 to 8 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.276" offset="4869016">The Court of Military Appeals has held that O’Callahan does not apply to petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.838" offset="4895347">That court, the Court of Claims and several district courts have held that on off duty, off post crime committed overseas may be punished by court martial and this Court denied certiorari and a case involving that question last term and again in another case this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.292" offset="4993149">The Gallagher case number 392 in which certiorari was denied on October 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.958" offset="5023765">With respect to serious crimes committed within the United States, the few cases we know of have applied a multi-factor approach that does not permit the statement the rules of thumb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.432" offset="5081652">It reminds me a bit of the massing of the elements approach sometimes followed with confusion if I might say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.556" offset="5122194">In some modern state decisions in the field of conflict of laws, the Court of Military Appeals appears to have developed a rule that crimes committed by a serviceman on post are without more sufficiently service connected to justify court martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.629" offset="5202442">With respect to off post crimes, that court considers a number of factors case by case including the military status or relationship of the victim and the role of the offenders military -- the role which the military offenders military status are played in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.508" offset="5285930">In addition to the cases on pages 6 to 8 of our brief I can also refer to a decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on November 9th, Zenor against Vogt which involved what you might call a routine assault by one serviceman on another serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.937" offset="5387703">They have both been to the club on the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.765" offset="5407033">The second serviceman had danced with the first man -- serviceman’s girlfriend in a way that the first man didn’t like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.476" offset="5437858">There was a challenge and later still on the base there was an assault.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.403" offset="5501597">It is simply a case of an assault committed on base and the Fifth Circuit held that there should be no injunction against the conduct of a court martial that it was appropriate for court martial following the on-base rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.668" offset="5570664">It's a case like this in many respects except that both parties were service en there and the offense here is more serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.231" offset="5616849">The various aspects of this case, the present Relford case which are in sharp contrast with O’Callahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.175" offset="5652689">There the crime occurred in a civilian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.217" offset="5668780">Here the crimes were on military post.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.427" offset="5685708">There the victim had no military connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.626" offset="5702426">Here the victim had military ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.848" offset="5715383">One is a minor sister of a serviceman and the other a wife of a serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.096" offset="5744327">The result we urge is that any crime by a serviceman jeopardizing the security of persons or property on a military reservation, particularly when it's his military reservation should be regarded as per se service connected because of the basic impact such crimes have on a military mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.451" offset="5837740">Whether the court martial jurisdiction should extend beyond that to off post crimes or to non-physical crimes on post like fraud or bad checks is not involved in this case and need not be decided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.963" offset="5915794">The rule for which we contend is implicit in the O’Callahan opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.034" offset="5944111">The petitioner suggests that court martial jurisdiction should extend only to cases where the offender has violated a uniquely military standard of behavior such as failing to salute or assaulting an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.201" offset="6008790">But the constitutional authority for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces surely covers more than the authority to arrest the member of the Forces who jeopardizes the safety and security of this post and turn him over to the civilian authorities who may have little natural interest in the problem for prosecution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1580.020" offset="6320065">There are some millions who have been subjected to court martial trials in the period since the Second World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.486" offset="6369907">The number would be relatively smaller, that would be of the order of a thousand or a few thousand rather than the 25,000 if you include petty crimes and what might be called purely military offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.194" offset="6456738">I can undertake to get some figures on this and submit it in a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.442" offset="6481711">I'm not prepared to give you a definitive answer now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.041" offset="6512118">The contention which we urge seems to have been recognized in the O’Callahan opinion which referred to the fact that the crimes there were not committed on a military post or enclave according from the opinion and also to the fact that the crimes there did not affect the security of the military post.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.749" offset="6618906">There is surely a clear military interest in the security of persons having business on a military post from physical attack by servicemen on that post.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.769" offset="6663001">The Commander of a Military Installation clearly has the responsibility to maintain law and order in his command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.966" offset="6695811">And he should have the authority to do so in so far as service personnel are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.435" offset="6721724">A post cannot be segregated into military and non-military areas for law enforcement purposes nor should it make any difference whether the offender is technically on duty or in or out of uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.584" offset="6782328">So long as he is in the military service and remains on post, he necessarily remains subject to such elementary regulation by his Commander.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.852" offset="6823393">This is particularly true where the victims are close relatives of servicemen as they are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.855" offset="6855367">In the interest of clarity we urge the court to hold that the fact that a crime committed by a servicemen against person or property occurred on a military reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.972" offset="6899879">A territorial jurisdiction test which is traditional in our criminal law is alone enough to warrant court martial of the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.106" offset="6952333">It's not enough to say that the man should be turned over to the civilian authorities, some military reservations are vast and remote and it's not clear as a matter of the allocation of governmental responsibility why a local court in jury perhaps far removed should be expected to vindicate the military’s disciplinary problems with it's own personnel in it's own community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.369" offset="7069466">But more fundamentally, the constitutional grant of power of Government and Regulation should carry with them the power to punish and not simply the power to arrest and accuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.519" offset="7138011">Now I turn to the other question on which certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.210" offset="7160790">It's also important that in the administration of military justice to know whether the O’Callahan decision is to be applied retroactively and if so to what extent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.679" offset="7210632">Although a favorable decision on the either question would dispose of this case, we urge the Court to decide both questions in order that the many people having responsibility in this area, military personnel, military judges, the court of military appeals and the lower federal courts may have appropriate guidance in carrying out their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.462" offset="7321809">In O’Callahan, statutory provisions going directly back to 1916 and indirectly back to the beginning of the republic where held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.194" offset="7376771">This has required the revamping of military justice on a large scale and it is meant that practice is long followed in good faith can no longer be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.790" offset="7427135">Of course, the decision of this Court will be complied within the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.356" offset="7445420">So as I have indicated much guidance is still needed but things that were done in the past in good faith should be regarded as having at least de facto validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.121" offset="7500382">We submit that this change and basic court martial law for it was a change should be treated as prospective only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.854" offset="7735380">The only suggestion I think was in an article published in 1960 which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.670" offset="7762651">A Law Review Article but -- and I think it's also appropriate to say that in the cases which held that non-military persons could not be subjected to court martial, Reid and Covert, and Kinsella against Singleton and several others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.731" offset="7838824">There -- even with the benefit of the hindsight which I have now in rereading those opinions, I can find no suggestion by the Court that this was an area involving servicemen which was subject to reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.827" offset="7911236">I think more specifically on that in the opinion of the court in Kinsella against Singleton 361 U.S. written by Mr. Justice Clark with seven members of the court concurring in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.371" offset="7973407">He said on pages beginning on 240 and continuing on page 241 “the test for jurisdiction it follows is one of status namely whether the accused in the court martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term land and naval Forces.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.220" offset="8060865">And I think that was the last authoritative word from this Court and the last intimation until the O’Callahan case was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.806" offset="8103184">Mr. Solicitor General, the rule as I understand was not that automatically and without exemption be retried in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.730" offset="8134844">There were cases in the World War II where one in particular Camp Claiborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.576" offset="8162220">A rape occurred on Camp Claiborne's territory and the men were investigated by CID, etcetera and then turned over to the civilian federal authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.161" offset="8204643">I think Mr. Justice that it is right that there were quite a considerable practice of concurrent jurisdiction and that it was not denied that the States have the power to try depending on this complicated questions about the title and ownership of the military reservations which are very confused --</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.822" offset="8299207">But it ended up and that that one was the largest camp at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.056" offset="8312163">It was not a military reservation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2080.007" offset="8320000">Yes, I have no doubt that there are many cases of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.254" offset="8341002">All I am asserting is that where it does involve a serviceman and is on the base that he should be subject to military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.956" offset="8391784">Now the problems of retroactivity are now before this Court in other cases and they are difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.559" offset="8438178">In closing my argument on this, I would like to refer to another – a pair of cases which are not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.670" offset="8486661">I gave Mr. Detrick a memorandum of them yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.361" offset="8509440">In searching for guidance in this area and one of the things which I read was the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in Bell against Maryland in 378 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.810" offset="8563148">The problem there is rather different from here but it is one of the few places where there is some discussion of what happens when there’s a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.358" offset="8605362">And in a footnote in that opinion there is cited the case of United States against Chambers and 291 U.S., a case on which I worked many years ago and that brought back recollections to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.193" offset="8676728">The Chambers case is one which arose out of the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment and by the Twenty-First Amendment in 1933 and 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.822" offset="8727197">And the Chambers case itself simply holds that pending prosecutions which have not become final would fall with the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.758" offset="8782994">But the question what to do about convictions which have become final before the Twenty-First Amendment was adopted never came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.213" offset="8828761">It was decided a number of times in lower courts and this Court only denied certiorari and the whole inference, the whole basis of assumption in the Chambers opinion recognized in the ensuing failure to take up any cases and reach a different result was that when the Eighteenth Amendment was repealed that had no effect on judgments which had become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.327" offset="8957283">Now I recognize that this is a different forum of constitutional change than was that involved in the adoption of the Twenty-First Amendment repealing the Eighteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.947" offset="9015693">Nevertheless, it seems to me that whatever the form is this is a case of constitutional change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.760" offset="9047040">A well understood and accepted and acted upon understanding of constitutional power under which these prior convictions have been obtained was determined in O’Callahan to be no longer effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.026" offset="9120078">Of course I do not --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2280.758" offset="9123004">Solicitor Griswold, do you have any figures at all or any idea of the impact on the -- let’s assume that O’Callahan did not meet this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.178" offset="9184653">That this was a serviceman connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.953" offset="9199804">What about the retroactivity of O’Callahan on that on the stand in the terms of impact?</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2307.076" offset="9228225">I do not know Mr. Justice how many persons are now being held if for none purely military offenses pursuant to judgments which became final before June 2, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.952" offset="9299801">I can say from my own experience that there have been fewer petitions for habeas corpus relying on O’Callahan then I anticipated that there would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.794" offset="9347135">Should this Court hold that it is retroactive, I would anticipate that there would be a considerable increase in the numbers such of the petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.310" offset="9389140">I will endeavor to see if I can get any figures on that and submit them with respect to the other material that I have said I would present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.047" offset="9432085">And so we submit that the judgment below can be affirmed on both grounds that is, that there was court martial jurisdiction here and that O’Callahan should not be given a retroactive application to this case.</text>
