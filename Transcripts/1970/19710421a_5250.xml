            <text syncTime="37.487" offset="253367">My name is Thomas C. Binkley.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.611" offset="261831">I’m a member of the firm of Howser, Thomas, Summers &amp; Binkley and my co-counsel is Mr. Philip Carden from Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.195" offset="300178">This -- the petitioner in this case, was tried in the Federal District Court in Nashville where he was charged in three counts of an eight-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.059" offset="359633">Specifically, he was charged with conspiracy or being a part of a conspiracy to rob banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.621" offset="389831">He was charged with the robbing of a bank and he was charged with receiving money from the robbery of this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.733" offset="426297">This trial took some 29 days, not of actual trial time but 29 days to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.724" offset="486275">The petitioner herein was apprehended at the time this trial took place, he had been apprehended and returned to the penitentiary on the 5th day of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.325" offset="556701">The bank robbery, he was alleged to have been involved in, occurred on the 24th day of April.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.858" offset="602781">Yes sir, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.005" offset="615424">It was pointed out at the trial or it was argued by counsel for the Government at the trial that they were going to show that his escape was a part of the conspiracy, but this was never shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.087" offset="675715">This is important for the Court because there were other charges made.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.563" offset="689612">In this eight-count indictment there was a charge of a bank robbery which occurred on August the 3rd which was some two months after the petitioner was put back in jail and then there was also a charge of murder as a violation of federal statute to conceal crimes previously committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.843" offset="770696">All of this occurred after the petitioner was returned to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.577" offset="797654">Now, our primary contentions before the Court, our first proposition; we’re saying that the recent rulings of the Court have changed or should change the conspiracy exception to the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.739" offset="870379">We think this is specifically, I mean, especially true in view of the Bruton decision, in view of the Jackson versus Denno case decided before Bruton and it’s our contention that Bruton draws these cases together.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.313" offset="928580">As the Court will recall in the Jackson case, it was concerned with the confession which was turned over to the jury under the New York rule which provided that the jury should determine whether the confession is voluntary or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.989" offset="995349">We think even though it hasn’t been expanded at this point to cover cases involving conspiracy, it’s our contention that it should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.093" offset="1035786">In the Court, in the case -- in the court below, the district judge allowed proof to be offered and determined that the jury should determine whether or not a conspiracy in fact existed, whether or not out of Court statements made by a declarant, who was a part of the -- one of the declarants making out of Court statements was a part of the conspiracy, whether the statements were made in the course of the conspiracy and whether it was in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.718" offset="1234213">We’re -- it’s our contention that the rationale of Bruton and the cases preceding Bruton, Jackson versus Denno and others which are mentioned in Bruton that the logical consequence is to do away with the conspiracy exception rule as it is now employed by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.723" offset="1330239">We can see little difference in allowing, in saying that it’s a violation of constitutional rights to allow a jury to determine the voluntariness of a confession and then on the other hand say that it wouldn’t be proper or that it would be proper for them to determine whether a conspiracy in fact existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.046" offset="1423548">And we submit in our case, in the present case before the Court, the way it was tried, we allowed the out of court hearsay statements to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.422" offset="1489063">We allowed the prosecution -- the prosecution of course, can start the case any way they want to, the prosecution started this case in this case with the murder count and then the jury has to sift through 13 days of testimony and determine whether or not this conspiracy in fact existed before they can start determining, before they can weigh the testimony and we submit especially in the framework of our case, that it was difficult for the trial judge to keep up with the statements without requiring the jury to in effect determine whether the conspiracy existed by the hearsay statements they were hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.655" offset="1714030">And we feel that the proper rule, the rule which should be required of any District Court in trying this would be first to determine whether the conspiracy exists without turning this over to the jury and it is our contention that the rationale of the Bruton case would require this route.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.308" offset="1964596">We have to guarantee him as fairer trial as we can and certainly you obviate some of the difficulties you have if you require that at first be established that the conspiracy exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.675" offset="2118092">But this is the problem that the Court has been faced with in the Jackson case and others and as was stated so by Justice Jackson in the Krulewitch case that you just can't expect the jury to be able to sift all of this through and there has to be a limitation on human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.502" offset="2225403">And in the present case before the court with the conglomeration of proof that was offered, we just feel that it would be impossible for the jury to determine this.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.139" offset="2279946">Our second proposition is concerned with the fact that we are stating that the petitioner herein was deprived of a fair trial by or was prejudiced by not having a severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.698" offset="2350164">His case was different from the other defendants involved in that he was incarcerated at a time the alleged murder was committed, at the time the second bank robbery was committed and could have had no part in this, at least, it would have to be affirmatively shown that he had a part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.241" offset="2436368">Since the 1966 Amendment to Rule 14, it’s up to the district judge if he sees there’s going to be some prejudice involved to sever the cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.801" offset="2806575">Now certainly a person in jail, I’m sure, could take part in a conspiracy, but I think at the time he’s arrested, there would be a presumption that his part has ended then it would be on the Government to affirmatively show that his part continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.972" offset="2983267">Certainly the Government can show that he was a part of the conspiracy and if the Government can prove that he was a part of it up to a point and they prove this beyond a reasonable doubt, certainly he can be convicted of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.467" offset="3049200">The complaint the petitioner makes about the matters that took place after he was arrested is that this not only affected the conspiracy account, it affected the substantive count and put him on a position where as we argue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.583" offset="3137703">There were only two witnesses against him and witnesses we say were of questionable character, but the totality of the circumstances in this case, put the petitioner in such a position that it’s our contention the jury couldn’t weigh the testimony of these two witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.618" offset="3225893">And we feel this could all have been taken care of by a severance and the severance was asked for initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.000" offset="3267375">For example, as we point out, the case was started by the prosecution putting on evidence of a murder that took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.639" offset="7065893">But what the judge did say and what the theory of this case is was that Bostic had been shown to be a member of the conspiracy to rob banks on plenty of evidence that had nothing to do with the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.938" offset="7123153">Plenty of evidence of what he did and what he and Self said to his girlfriend in Court long before he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.967" offset="7167248">This first robbery occurred in April and then they went down to Florida, a group of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.151" offset="7211969">At this point, Beard comes into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.479" offset="7229315">Apparently he’s a friend of Fergusons and then a whole group of them go up and try to rob a bank in Orlinda, that’s includes this petitioner, at Orlinda, Tennessee, but that bank robbery was unsuccessful because an employee the bank lived above it, heard the noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.133" offset="7319907">And then they come back and in June, petitioner is arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.567" offset="7361599">Now at that point he’s out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.850" offset="7370794">There’s no question I think that on the facts of this case and I think there isn’t any question the jury so understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.400" offset="7404962">It happened to be as highly selective jury in its verdict even as to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.274" offset="7428472">And for example is, in August bank robbery where he was charged but the jury wasn’t satisfied with the proof as to that robbery so the only person who was convicted in relation to that conspiracy was Beard who was shown to have had the money from the robbery in his actual possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.297" offset="7508511">And while the judge did not specifically charge that the murder was not to be considered in relation to petitioner, he did charge in relation to statements as to others that as -- and that’s at 556 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.752" offset="7634422">The statements, testimonies been offered relating to statements made by one or more of the defendants on one or more occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.160" offset="7679979">Testimony being of the witness is Leeman who test -- who was a member of the conspiracy and testified to acts either that he knew about the planning or that had been told to him right after the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.341" offset="7740688">Connie, who relates only to statements by Beard from and that’s petitioners girlfriend and Letos who was with the group in Florida and testified to statements they made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.063" offset="7783633">So that we do not have as to this petitioner the basic rules going into questions of proving his part in the conspiracy for the time he was in it by statements of co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.605" offset="7869837">The major part of the proof against him came from his co-conspirator Leeman and his own personal admissions to his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.725" offset="7910275">Now, there was some other co-conspirators statements admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.193" offset="7944129">But as a matter of fact when there was an attempt to prove some of the statements that Ferguson had made to some of the girls, at that point, page 148 of the record, counsel have checked it and that didn't come in in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.950" offset="8023124">Some other statements by Ferguson came in at another time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.072" offset="8039633">Other complaints that are made by petitioner about hearsay evidence don’t mention him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.286" offset="8068472">As a matter of fact, the main complaint is in relation to testimony regarding a young man himself and had nothing to do with petitioner, so that this case really does not involve the Grunewald question or the co-conspirator rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.609" offset="9613772">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.806" offset="9618578">That is our position because our position is that it is perfectly clear on this record in every way that Bostic was not charged directly or by implication with the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.370" offset="9684825">On the other hand, it is perfectly clear on this record that Bostic was properly convicted both of the Bordeaux bank robbery with which he was charged and winged with being a member of the conspiracy for the length of time that he was out of jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.743" offset="9762356">I suppose he will always feel as long as that opinion stands, he’s charged and convicted of something else, would he?</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.551" offset="9793599">Well, Your Honor, I think it’s significant that in the petition for certiorari and I think in his brief he says the question is, whether the Court of Appeals should have charged him as being responsible for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.592" offset="9845739">And although the Court of Appeals really says is, that it wasn’t -- there was no showing of affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy, I don’t think, they said he did it or really had any part in it and they just said technically, legally he had withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.734" offset="9930271">I think that was wrong because I think that on these facts would show, he was taken over the penitentiary and there’s absolutely nothing in the record to show that anybody even visited him after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.241" offset="9976351">I think it would be wrong to impute the murder to him, but I don’t think it was done at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.903" offset="9999026">I think it was made perfectly clear that he wasn’t involved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Binkley</label>
            <text syncTime="2488.881" offset="10058898">Nine minutes, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.538" offset="10069556">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.667" offset="10074049">There has been some confusion on this and I think at least for our argument today, we’ve been drawn away to what might possibly be one of the minor issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.044" offset="10143535">But to answer in a way, the record will show the parts of the testimony we’ve cited in the appendix will show, that the prosecutor wouldn’t do me any favor and the petitioner any favor when he conceded that the petitioner was back in the penitentiary because I’ve tried in most to the case keep that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.546" offset="10225560">And so I didn’t feel like I could elaborate on this man’s incarceration because it certainly doesn’t help you before a jury to let you know that your client's from that place of residence at this time is a state penitentiary.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2545.219" offset="10284283">Yes, but didn’t it help you quite a bit to have him cut loose from this, at least very much premeditated murder, motivated murder?</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.155" offset="10339976">It would help him a lot better, didn’t it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.525" offset="10345514">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.843" offset="10346768">I believe that, I’m sure that did help him if in fact this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.994" offset="10375398">The count was still tied on to the conspiracy charge and it’s just a question of whether the jury can remove this from their minds and take it away, especially in view of everything else that came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.720" offset="10438301">Now, there was a testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.353" offset="10448750">It’s pointed out in our brief and we’ve cited examples in the appendix of portions where the Government impeached their own witnesses with prior statements not made by the person, but alleged to have been made by the FBI man where the statement of what the FBI man said the witness said was read in open court to impeach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.086" offset="10547702">There was also some testimony of declarations made by Ferguson, who of course was dead and who we had no way to cross examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.332" offset="10592737">There was also an FBI report brought in by -- when Beard was being testified, of course, this takes Beard a little out of the rationale of the Bruton case, but we submit that we’ve pointed out instances where this has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.557" offset="10669641">Now, there was a discussion in Court when Ferguson’s brother was testifying and they were trying to allow this to come in by asking Ferguson’s brother first, if he knew any of the parties and then saying, “Now, don’t name the parties but go ahead and tell us what was said” and of course that was objected to, but that was allowed to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.660" offset="10777997">It’s our contention that it should be spelled out that now is the appropriate time, the rationale of the Bruton case, taking into account the Jackson case and others should set down the rule that the Government, just like in a -- question of volunteer confession, the trial judge should first determine there is a conspiracy before he allows all of this hearsay to come in and then ask the jury after you’ve heard all this, determine whether conspiracy existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.217" offset="10924283">A conspiracy case is a difficult case to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.922" offset="10935045">The record shows that every piece of hearsay and double hearsay was brought into this record by the prosecutor standing up and saying, but Your Honor, this is a conspiracy case which means everything goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.004" offset="10995440">This -- it’s our contention that now is the time and certainly if the Court doesn’t feel that this should be reversed on -- under the Bruton rule, certainly it was prejudicial and prejudice could have been taken away by severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.786" offset="11074539">And certainly with the obstacles, the difficulties the Court of Appeals found in this that the judge, the trial judge found, certainly it should have been known that we could have avoided any of this by having a separate trial and we’ll never know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.749" offset="11146324">Of course, we concede the jury convicted, but we’ll never know, how they would have weighed the testimony of the two witnesses against the petitioner herein had their minds not been cluttered with all these other things that I couldn’t remove from the jury just as I couldn’t remove myself from the counsel table where we were required to be by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.112" offset="11243813">And it’s our contention that this case should be reversed and remanded on our two grounds.</text>
