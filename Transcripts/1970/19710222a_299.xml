            <text syncTime="46.090" offset="288768">This case is of course here on appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals, State of California upon this Court’s order postponing jurisdiction pending hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.056" offset="344670">The Chief Justice’s suggestion I certainly will keep very brief this statement of facts, but fundamentally we do have here the appellant charged and convicted of engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct in violation of the California disturbing the peace statute Penal Code Section 415.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.447" offset="430143">Although there was a reversal upon the first level of appeal, appellant affirmed the superior of court, it was then certified to the Court of Appeals which vacated and affirmed the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.135" offset="468908">California Supreme Court refused the hearing, four-to-three decision on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.383" offset="493881">And of course fundamentally, may it please the Court what this young man did was to walk through a courthouse corridor in Los Angeles county on his way to a courtroom where he had some business.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.297" offset="593565">While walking through that corridor he was wearing a jacket upon which were inscribed the words “Fuck the draft”, also were inscribed the words “Stop war” and several peace symbols.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.428" offset="634107">When he entered the courtroom, he took off his jacket and held it folded.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.990" offset="728357">Furthermore, the policeman who observed him walking through the corridor before he went into the courtroom -- this is in the record, requested the judge in courtroom to hold the young man in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.443" offset="770152">The judge refused to hold the young man in contempt because there was nothing to be seen in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.039" offset="792513">I shouldn’t say that, I don’t know what he would have done if he did see anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.048" offset="804634">But there was nothing to be seen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melville B. Nimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="312.638" offset="1354982">Something like that Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.578" offset="1362714">It incidentally is not a courtroom where draft cases are tried, it’s not the federal court it’s the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.181" offset="1393121">Well, I think it’s important at the outset to point out to the court that there was no violence, no component of violence present.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.936" offset="1420184">It is stated in the settled statements signed by the trial judge that the appellant did not engage in violence, did not threaten violence, that no one observing him engaged in violence or threat in violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.607" offset="1466786">So the violence component is completely out and I suggest that that is terribly significant for the significance the broader significance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.774" offset="1503462">Pointing out as it does as it can do depending on this court’s decision the very vital distinction between dissent which may be offensive to people, some people may not like it but non violent dissent and violent dissent -- a distinction that all too often are younger -- members of the younger generation tend to forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.200" offset="1589248">They tend to equate violent dissent and dissent that may be regarded as objectionable or offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.895" offset="1623939">It is terribly important we submit Your Honors that this Court may clear that distinction, that dissent by its very nature involves the right to be offensive if non-offensive dissent is almost a contradiction in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.824" offset="1675661">Because if it’s not offensive it means you agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.655" offset="1687050">But on the other hand violent dissent is something quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.968" offset="1700216">And this -- the facts this case point out precisely that distinction, yet the trial court, first of all, erroneously we submit quite clearly erroneously, rule that it was completely unnecessary to show any component of violence in connection with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.481" offset="1770329">And that set forth, I think at Appendix 19 where they said -- the trial judge said, “Simply if it’s offensive that’s enough.”</text>
            <text syncTime="426.643" offset="1810975">And we submit that that clearly is unconstitutional given the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.066" offset="1836680">Beyond that the Court of Appeals when it came to rule in this case and affirmed the decision below was not prepared to go that far indicated that there wasn’t necessity for a violence component.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.096" offset="1888820">But it’s very interesting to note the way they handled that.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.044" offset="1904598">What they said was, first they quoted appellant’s position that there must be a likelihood of violence arising from offensive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.444" offset="1942215">And the courts -- the Court of Appeals, State Court of Appeals opinion at the beginning says, “That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.352" offset="1957784">We subscribe to that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.523" offset="1962486">There must be a likelihood of violence arising from the offensive conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="468.427" offset="1978055">But then on the course of the opinion they go on to say, “It’s sufficient if there’s a tendency to violence if a violent act might occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="477.004" offset="2012432">And then they say, “This might occur” because a man walking with his wife and children seeing this words on the jacket “might emphasize”, it was my emphasis, might resort to violence to attack this man who was exhibiting this word that is found offensive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melville B. Nimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="661.017" offset="2748458">Mr. Chief Justice, first of all in terms of the fighting words I don’t see any likelihood to the facts constituting those fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.287" offset="2777506">But in any event, I think the fundamental point is it is the burden of the state to show that in the given circumstances that these were fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.460" offset="2810211">That is given the factual situation that you described with servicemen around and so on that it’s a factual burden on the state to show that in those particular circumstances there was a likelihood of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.305" offset="2857650">No such showing was made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.636" offset="2866949">Beyond that, perhaps I should further elucidate on the possible distinction between oral and written.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.456" offset="2886175">It is certainly true that there maybe some non-speech interest that arise in the connection with an oral statement that may not arise with the written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.214" offset="2917209">For example, you spoke of him chanting, well if there were a constant oral kind of communication that became disturbing then regardless of the content of the speech that might be grounds for the state moving in and stopping this.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.033" offset="2980530">So in that sense there can be a distinction between oral and verbal but I don’t make the distinction in terms of the intellectual content of what is said.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.798" offset="3019609">Well, the Court of Appeals then, the California State Court of Appeals attempted to defend the lower court decision on the grounds that there was a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.153" offset="3060987">It might have happened that there would be violence despite the fact that the settled statement clearly says, signed by the trial judge that there was no violence and no likelihood of violence either by the appellant or by anyone hostile to him or with him viewing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.403" offset="3125979">And so this was quite contrary to the facts of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.570" offset="3138727">Beyond that, quite apart from that, the standard adopted by the Court of Appeals is quite improper in view of the carefully worked out doctrine that this Court has enunciated through the years about First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.474" offset="3182299">Note the possible implications for example in cases like Edwards versus South Carolina, where Negro demonstrators peacefully present their views at the State House.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.260" offset="3225454">Now, one could certainly say there that it is possible given the southern atmosphere it is possible there might be someone in the audience, a White person observing, who might resort to violence, that’s possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.998" offset="3276340">But this Court has made very clear that that’s not enough of a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.119" offset="3288879">The mere possibility, there must be a likelihood, a real likelihood and an imminence in order to justify abridging freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.964" offset="3320226">That standard was certainly not met here and there’s nothing in the record to reflect such a standard here.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.729" offset="3451361">We certainly recognize that in given circumstances the issuance of profanity may cause a clear and present danger of a violent reaction and if that -- if those are the circumstances then the profanity can be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.978" offset="3500262">It is also conceivable that in given circumstances the profanity will be used in an obscenity setting as this Court has defined obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.934" offset="3528161">Again, under this Court’s decision the First Amendment would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.539" offset="3546551">It is also possible the profanity or whatever is said maybe used in circumstances where the person had no right to be where he was although the Adderly doctrine and then again the mere fact that he is using profanity does not give him an absolute right to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.060" offset="3604647">But in the situation where the various contexts that this Court has found justify not applying the First Amendment where those context do not arise as they do not arise here then we submit Your Honor that the mere fact that this happens to be profanity does not justify the state from coming in and stopping the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.309" offset="3685627">We submit Your Honors that there are very serious and important First Amendment implications here that should be realized and I’d like at this point then to trace them.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.614" offset="3722825">Because having passed the point and I certainly would be happy to come back if any of the Court wishes on any of these various exclusionary grounds why the First Amendment does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.394" offset="3769950">Assuming that none of those are pertained and we submit they do not as set forth in the whole part one of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.898" offset="3795968">Going to part two of our brief, why is profanity itself worthy of protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="928.649" offset="3818956">Well, one really doesn’t have to put it in that context because the First Amendment says, “speech is protected.”</text>
            <text syncTime="933.604" offset="3838809">You don’t have to justify it on any other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.612" offset="3854796">But let’s look for a moment at the policy reasons which underlie the First Amendment if we may and see why they do apply in the area of profanity, as well as elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.489" offset="3894397">We know that one fundamental reason as Justice Brandeis pointed out in his famous Whitney Concurrence, one fundamental reason why free speech is important is because of its contribution to the democratic dialog.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.420" offset="3950090">A self-governing people can govern wisely only if they hear all material, all data from all sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.159" offset="3981019">And this Court made that point again most recently in the Red Lion case.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.001" offset="4028353">Your Honor ,I understand the argument can be made and perhaps you by implication are making it.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.571" offset="4046639">Why do they have to use these words?</text>
            <text syncTime="987.122" offset="4052908">Why couldn’t he simply said, “I hate the draft” and if put forward the democratic dialog equally as well?</text>
            <text syncTime="994.083" offset="4080703">And we have several fold answer to that. First of all, on a more superficial level if you will, if this appellant had used the more laundered form of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.728" offset="4127305">If he had said, “I hate the draft”, then the self-governing people, the people who must make decisions based upon freedom of speech and what they hear from that freedom of speech would be somewhat less wise than they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.741" offset="4179341">Now, what do I mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.776" offset="4187491">I mean by that that the mere fact that this young man chose to choose a word which many people would no doubt find disagreeable and no doubt no question of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.003" offset="4224376">The mere fact that he chose to use that word is important data for the self-governing people to know, to know that he feels this deeply about this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.914" offset="4260007">If they don’t -- if you use the laundered form of expression “I hate the draft” they would have been ignorant to a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.971" offset="4284249">And as Dr. Meiklejohn said in his famous work, following the Brandeis Formula, the self-governing people must know -- have access to all material and all data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.979" offset="4328344">Now if they didn’t know about his depth of feeling that was evidenced by this word or knowing that what are the consequences?</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.732" offset="4355302">Well it -- they could be any one of the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.489" offset="4362303">Maybe the self-governing people decide that if that’s the attitude of the young people the penalty for the draft was made for avoiding the draft must be made more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.387" offset="4397934">Or on the contrary it might be repeal the draft, or any one of the number of other possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.658" offset="4415070">The point is they know somewhat less by the state stepping in and changing that kind of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.045" offset="5104598">On the other hand, it’s a different question to conclude whether or not people have to see it for any considerable period of time and we respectfully suggest that was not necessary in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.919" offset="5152037">It is true that some people momentarily probably couldn’t avoid seeing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.858" offset="5167815">But there was no continuing requirement at all and that gets to this captive audience doctrine, it was of the kind of fleeting contact as one has, if one walks through a Hyde park type area where you may hear fleetingly offensive sounds but they are no more than fleeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.691" offset="5239181">Well, I started to get to what I -- if I may, -- what I think is the more profound reason why this Court must recognize that the First Amendment goes not only to offensive content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.717" offset="5287246">And certainly this Court has made clear over and over again that no matter how offensive the idea conveyed its still is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.820" offset="5315668">The writings of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin certainly are far more offensive to many people than the word before this Court and this case that appears in 7 out of 10 of the best selling works of 1969, as indicated in the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.239" offset="5377317">Certainly, offensiveness per se does not derogate from the right to speak under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.280" offset="5409499">But then the question comes back what about the form of the offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.408" offset="5422038">If the offensiveness comes in form rather than in substance, and I have made one point on that knowing the depth of the feeling, this is data that the public is entitled to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.524" offset="5454535">There’s a more profound point if I may and that is, linguists tell us that language performs two functions, there is the emotive content of the language and there is the intellectual content of language and that these intersperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.712" offset="5515243">That is the intellectual content is that which carries the message per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.630" offset="5530917">The emotive content of language is that which persuades we are all human beings, we are all moved to a degree by emotional considerations, as well as by intellectual considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.649" offset="5566966">And then emotive content is also important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.051" offset="5576579">Now we get to what the First Amendment is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.865" offset="5583893">And what it is all about of course is competition in the marketplace of ideas, what ideas are going to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.742" offset="5611374">We subscribe to the democratic faith that the ideas that prevail by a majority are the ideas which should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.155" offset="5636974">But in order for that system to work, it’s important that the state not step in and try to censor either emotive content or intellectual content because depending on the emotive content, particular emotive content it will appeal, the message will appeal to various groups of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.081" offset="5704683">And by determining what the emotive -- by censoring the emotive content even if not the intellectual content, the state is thereby enabled to a great degree to determine what group will buy this idea, to what group this idea will appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.640" offset="5758913">And hence, ultimately we’ll be able to determine what ideas prevail in the competition of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.155" offset="5781065">And so for that reason we submit to the court respectfully that emotive content just as much as intellectual content or to put it on other way that the four offensiveness of form no less than offensiveness of substance must be preserved by the First Amendment if the First Amendment is to be meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.695" offset="5875210">Now, I should like to if I may with the Court’s permission point out one other aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.261" offset="5921395">And that has to do with this hostile audience veto that was referred to a little bit in the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.734" offset="5947308">This is another element that comes into play in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.111" offset="5960892">The court could decide the decision here without deciding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.106" offset="5980850">We submit it would be both proper and desirable for the court to get into this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.073" offset="6000703">What that has to do with is the Court of Appeals’ decision saying there was a likelihood of violence not from those who were followers of the defendant here but from those who were hostile to what he had to say, they might resort to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.645" offset="6054933">And the question is posed even if there was such a likelihood or even if a mere tendency is a sufficient standard, is it enough to put down the speaker because those who dislike what he says may resort to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.429" offset="6110104">As Professor Chasey (ph) said, as quoted more accurately in my brief, but does a man have to -- can a man be arrested because his neighbors don’t have enough self-control to stop themselves when they see -- when they hear something or read something they don’t like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.025" offset="6168513">We suggest that the time has come when this Court should make very clear as it has in part in Edwards and in Cox that a hostile audience at least if the police can control the hostile audience is not sufficient to stop the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.765" offset="6227446">This becomes a very current issue on college campuses today where many members of the Government and other established people cannot go on campus because the college audiences are sufficiently hostile so that they attempt by sometimes by violent acts to stop the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.469" offset="6298290">This is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.077" offset="6300693">This is contrary to the First Amendment and this is the time for this Court to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.271" offset="6317516">There was a case, a lower court case cited in our brief in Stacy versus Williams in which precisely that issue pertaining to the college campus was decided by a Federal District Court in Mississippi, overruling a state regulation stating that if -- that a speaker might not come on a college campus, if there is a likelihood that the students will resort to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.163" offset="6409049">The Court said “Not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.740" offset="6415318">The police must put down the mob, not the speaker.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.570" offset="6426708">Well that too is involved in this case and we submit that this is an opportunity for this Court to make clear the nature of free speech for students, as well as for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.880" offset="6459935">With the Court’s permission, I should like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.353" offset="6513852">Yes Your Honor, several points if I may Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.743" offset="6535377">First of all it’s to be noted that the Bushman case further construed by the California Supreme Court, the very statute we have here, but it occurred after the decision by the Court of Appeals here and after the California Supreme Court refused to hear our case then the Bushman case per -- Mr. Chief Justice Treanor construed Section 415 and the offensive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.784" offset="6631508">Now that construction is somewhat ambiguous it seems to me because part of the opinion speaks of the requirement of a clear and present danger that offensive conduct will produce violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.324" offset="6681663">Elsewhere, the opinion speaks of a tendency to produce violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.733" offset="6695351">And so on the very issue I have suggested I think there is some ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.975" offset="6716249">Beyond that it’s interesting to note that the Supreme Court opinion in Bushman cites this case, Cohen, as standing for the proposition that there was a likelihood of violence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.747" offset="6763374">Well, there is absolutely nothing in the record to support that and -- to the contrary there is in the settled statement, page 20 of the appendix, a statement directly countering that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.270" offset="6957516">Your Honor, I think it comes a lot closer to meeting it than does the Court of Appeals opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.954" offset="6976219">I would still suggest with respect Your Honor that it does not meet federal standards for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.060" offset="6996595">First of all because it is ambiguous as I say on the question of whether on the one hand there must be a clear and present danger of violence arising from the words which constitute offensive conduct or whether there need merely be a tendency, that's one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.926" offset="7048108">Second point is, that the California Supreme Court in Bushman in no way goes into this hostile audience doctrine indicating that the statute would not apply if the likelihood of violence arises from a hostile audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.804" offset="7103592">And indeed, the California Supreme Court in People versus Davis, which is cited in appellee’s brief took the contrary position, not on the same statute but on anti-riot statute saying that “even if the danger comes from a hostile audience that’s still enough to abridge the speech.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.853" offset="7167854">So the suggestion is that the California Supreme Court does not recognize that doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.592" offset="7210799">First of all of course it would go back to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals would look at the Bushman opinion and see the California Supreme Court citation of Cohen as having been correctly decided and there would be nothing further for them to do but reaffirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.842" offset="7267746">And then perhaps ultimately it would come back here again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.205" offset="11373255">Because this very same Court, the same seven justices who ruled in Bushman unanimously were the same seven by four-to-three who denied a hearing in Cohen and by the fact that they -- one of the dissenters in Cohen, Chief Justice Treanor, the retired Chief Justice Treanor wrote the opinion in Bushman so I would have to assume that they have been approving of Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.181" offset="11521108">We would just repeat as I had cited in our brief and going back to Chaplinsky it’s been well urged, paraphrased in that that words of these type are no essential part of any exposition of ideas and sight social value as to step to the truth that any benefit that may be (Inaudible) was clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.999" offset="11604386">We believe the conviction the California Court of Appeal is valid and that the judgment should stand.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melville B. Nimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="2891.826" offset="11671677">Thank you very much Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.920" offset="11680037">I would like to make a few comments simply about taking off from Mr. Sauer said about the number of arrest that have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.391" offset="11705950">Actually if you look at the amicus brief of the ACLU of Northern California in this case there is a suggestion there are numerous arrests all over the country all the time for this kind of offense, and particularly relating to minority groups where no charge is made against the minority person other than that he engaged -- he uttered something that it was offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.354" offset="11785780">Now sometimes it may be fighting words but not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.180" offset="11797065">Sometimes that is -- it may be a preliminary to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.346" offset="11809813">But even if it’s not this kind of thing occurs and that gets me with the final point is, the point made by the ACLU amicus brief of Northern California, where they suggest that this Court may decide this case under a narrow grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.351" offset="11861849">And of course we agree on the narrow grounds suggested by them that the -- and I won’t repeat them because of lack of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.793" offset="11887553">But may I close Your Honors with the suggestion that if this case is decided for our side on narrow grounds, what it will mean is it will continue to be the fact that hundreds and thousands of people all over the country are arrested because they simply have used a word that others find offensive in this profanity area where there is no likelihood of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.340" offset="11973757">We suggest Your Honors that just as the basic underlying theory of the doctrine of over breadth in order to avoid a chilling effect, you decide a case even though you could decide it more narrowly in order to avoid the chilling effect on those not before the court then it would be particularly appropriate for this Court in this decision, if it does decide that there should be a reversal to go further and make clear that the language of profanity is not outside the scope of the First Amendment, simply because it’s offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.429" offset="12090159">It may be outside in given circumstances where it is a preliminary to violence or where there are other specific other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.483" offset="12114296">But simply because it is offensive it should be made clear this is within the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.928" offset="12132059">And one other point, final point on the hostile audience doctrine, again to make clear to college students that there is a distinction between engaging in dissent in such a way that you don’t like it and engaging in dissent as to put down the speaker, that too is outside the bounds of the First Amendment and this Court could make that clear.</text>
