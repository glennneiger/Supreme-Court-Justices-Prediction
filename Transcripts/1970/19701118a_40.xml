            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.320" offset="268622">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.812" offset="270608">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.467" offset="285236">These two cases consolidated here are here on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.428" offset="317106">In broad terms, the questions presented in both these cases is whether the Union, Local 825, of the Operating Engineers violated Section 8 (b) 4 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act in the so-called secondary boycott provision by exerting coercive pressures upon neutral employers in support of its dispute with the primary employer, the White Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.921" offset="431104">Now, that question can be further refined.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.958" offset="443225">All parties and the Board and the Court below are in agreement here that the Union did exert coercive pressures as defined by Section 8 (b) 4 (b) upon neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.657" offset="509994">Now, that statutory section further requires, for purposes relevant here, that such coercive conduct have, as an object, forcing or requiring an employer to seize doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.236" offset="592332">Now, this is the pivotal issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.439" offset="605080">The Board found that the Union’s coercive conduct had cessation of business as it read the statute, in the statutory sense, as an object of its conduct and the Board, therefore, found a violation of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="142.049" offset="671535">The Court below disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.338" offset="680730">Unlike the Board and unlike other Courts of Appeals which have considered this issue, the Court below reads the language in the statute quite literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.182" offset="728064">On the basis of that literal reading, the Court below held that the proof was insufficient to prove that the Union had an object to-- had a “seize doing business” object because the Union did not, as the Court saw the case, ask for a total cessation of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.011" offset="823463">Now, the underlying facts on at issue, the instant labor dispute arose at a construction site in Oyster Creek, New Jersey where a Burns &amp; Roe, Inc., a general contractor, was building a $68-Billion nuclear power plant for the Jersey Central Power and Light Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.990" offset="907368">Burns &amp; Roe, the general contractor in charge of this project, had no employees of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.243" offset="932342">It delegated all the-- no construction workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.787" offset="946552">It delegated all the construction work to three subcontractors, the White Construction Company, the Chicago Bridge, and-- Iron Company, and the Poirier &amp; McLane Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.805" offset="1002559">Now, all these three subcontractors had, among their employees, members of the Local 825 Operating Engineers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.567" offset="1041638">Local 825 had contracts with two of the subcontractors, Chicago Bridge and Poirier.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.543" offset="1065566">It had no collective bargaining agreement with either Burns, the general contractor, or with the White construction company.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.236" offset="1096286">Now, White’s job, one of the three subcontractors, its job under its subcontractor was to build this nuclear power plant, to create the reactor building for the nuclear power plant, and White’s equipment included, among other things, a piece of equipment known as an electrical welding machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.963" offset="1187192">And, as soon as White got the subcontract, he assigned the operation of this electrical welding machine, including-- starting on stopping the machine to employees of his who were members of the Iron Workers Union and Local 825, the Operating Engineers Union, who wanted that work and urged upon White that employees of White who were members of Local 825 of Operating Engineers be given the job of pushing the buttons which started and stopped the welding machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.796" offset="1334523">Now, Local 825, as I pointed out, didn’t have contracts with White, this subcontractor, or with the general contractor but, in support of its demand, they presented profit agreements to White and to Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.198" offset="1396172">As-- in effect, those agreements would commit White, the subcontractor, and the general contractor to give all power equipment including specifically welding machines and give that jurisdiction to the operating engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.548" offset="1473599">Now, these agreements would not only have bound the signatory, White, who was doing that work, it also bound subcontractors of the signatory so that Burns &amp; Roe, the general contractor, would have been bound to apply that subcontract to White who was a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.739" offset="1550294">Now, neither White nor Burns agreed to sign or yielded to this pressure to sign the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.522" offset="1585507">Now, while this dispute was going on, since all the parties involved had agreed that disputes of this kind, really a jurisdictional dispute, should be submitted to the National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.383" offset="1652903">The dispute was submitted around October 6th and, within a couple of weeks, the National Joint Board for the Settlement of-- I think it used to be called the Dunlop Board, settled this dispute and decided in favor of the Iron Workers to whom White had given the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.278" offset="1716433">But, the Operating Engineers weren’t satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.790" offset="1726568">They didn’t submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.242" offset="1732315">They refused to comply with that submission, with that determination of the Joint Board and they persisted in their efforts to regain the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.062" offset="1767633">Now, I’m-- just to telescope the fact just a little bit throughout this whole period before, during, and after the Joint Board submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.505" offset="1805354">Local 825 engaged in coercive efforts, this is agreed, engaged in coercive efforts by threats of work stoppages and by work stoppages to compel White to change its work assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.234" offset="1872332">Now, White, of course, who was doing the work in-- who was the employer who was doing the work in question and Local 825, so long as it observed unlawful efforts including, among other things, Section 8 (b) 4 (d), had a perfect right to try to get this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.603" offset="1941817">But, the fact is that Local 825 didn’t confine itself to lawful efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.786" offset="1966477">Not only did it use coercive pressures against White, the employer directly involved, the primary employer, it also used coercive pressures against the general contractor Burns, against the two other subcontractors Chicago and Poirier as a means to getting White to comply with its demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.393" offset="2044949">Now, Burns, Chicago, and Poirier had nothing to do with the assignment of White’s work.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.325" offset="2080684">White was the only, and they had no authority with respect to the assignment of White’s employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.487" offset="2105344">Now, on this state of the record, the Board found and the Court below agreed that this was a violation of Section 8 (b) 4 (d) of the Act which is a jurisdictional disputes provision, but the Board further found that insofar as the Union exerted coercive pressures on Burns, Chicago, and Poirier who were neutrals in this dispute over-- because of the workers on dispute, the Union also violated Section 8 (b) 4 (b) of the Act since an additional object of the Union’s pressure against the neutrals was to cause a disruption of business among the various employers at the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.630" offset="2297919">In the Board’s view, such an object, in the Board’s language, although something less than a total cancellation of business constitutes a “seize doing business” object within the meaning of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="567.500" offset="2373360">Now, there’s no quarrel here about the jurisdictional dispute finding that’s not in-- challenged, but very much an issue is the propriety of the Board’s Section 8 (b) 4 (b) finding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="583.994" offset="2439398">There were-- for one thing, they asked White, the-- Burns, rather, the general contractor, to sign a contract which would’ve bund the general contractor and his subcontractors to give this work to Operating Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.039" offset="2507525">They told him that unless he signed the contract there would be a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.345" offset="2520795">There was a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.236" offset="2528319">They told the other subcontractors unless Operating Engineers got the work, there would be work stoppages, and there were work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.425" offset="2565099">And, as a result of which, Operating Engineers employed by the other two subs went off the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.135" offset="2591953">These were the pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.433" offset="2597073">Incidentally, the Court below agrees that these kind of pressures, the threats of work stoppages and work stoppages fell within the statutory disagreement-- fell within the statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.051" offset="2639600">That finding isn’t challenged her by any party.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.796" offset="2654542">Now, the Court below, like the trial examiner in the Board proceeding, gave the statutory words “to seize doing business” a literal reading, in our view, an overly literal reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.341" offset="2716714">An object of seizing doing business, to the Court below, meant a total and complete cessation of business and intent to cause a disruption or successive disruptions as here, in the Court’s view, was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.710" offset="2786200">According to-- the Court below held that the statutory criterion for the finding of a violation, namely the object test, was not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.779" offset="2826533">This was not, the Court below thought, the kind of classical boycott, secondary boycott, which Congress was after.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.697" offset="2866134">Now, our position is the Court below erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.610" offset="2881808">I suppose much could be made of the fact, if Your Honors please, $68-million project was repeatedly interrupted by a fight as to who is to push a button on an electrical welding machine, but I don’t want to make light of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.932" offset="2951084">This case, like the National Woodwork, like others this Court has before it reflects the deep and really the understandable concern of Unions who are trying to preserve their job opportunities and their job security in the face of automation and increasing technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.367" offset="3028825">This Court has talked about it often and lucidly in the National Woodwork case among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.378" offset="3056933">Insofar as the Union sought to preserve its work opportunity for the employees it represented and insofar as it used lawful efforts, it was entitled to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.149" offset="3103953">Our position here, however, is that the Union went beyond lawful grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.020" offset="3131434">We submit that even if the Court below was right and that the only possible reading of “seize doing business” is a total cessation of business, we believe the Court erred on this regard on the side of literalism and we think a few basic postulates established by this Court confirm our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.676" offset="3226102">Now, first, the basic thrust of the so-called secondary boycott provision, that’s 8 (b) 4 (b), formally 8 (b) 4 (a), is that it is designed to protect unoffending employers from involvement pressures in controversies not their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.345" offset="3320769">That was the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.690" offset="3330173">It’s documented in the legislative history, and this Court has unim-- una-- uniformly confirmed that in its own decisions as far back as Denver Building in 341 US and at least as recently as National Woodwork in 386 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.884" offset="3402898">No one in this case, no one even suggests that Burns, the general contractor, and Chicago Bridge, and Poirier were anything other than neutrals in the dispute between White and Local 825.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.129" offset="3471862">No one but White could assign the work that was in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.257" offset="3488371">White was the primary employer, and the purpose and effect of the Union’s pressures on the other three companies was to involve them in a dispute which was no part of their-- not their own, no part of their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.650" offset="3557961">Now, the second proposition, a literal reading of Section 8 (b) 4 (b) like its companion provision Section 8 (e) is, in our view and we believe you have so have, a literal reading of those sections is an inadequate basis for determining the statutory reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.944" offset="3647195">It would be an imposition on your time, if Your Honors please, and my time is also limited, to labor the point that the statutory provisions in Section 8 (b) 4 (b) and Section 8 (e) were the product of Congressional conflict and Congressional compromise, and that this conflict and compromise are reflected in statutory language which, in fact to understate the matter, is somewhat lacking in precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.512" offset="3777390">I think it was this lack of language precision which prompted, I think, Mr. Justice Harlan to make the comment in National Woodwork which was a split opinion and, Mr. Justice Harlan, you commented that both sides of today’s division in the Court agreed that, in pursuing the search for the true intent of Congress, we should not stop with the language of the statute itself and must look beneath its surface to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.930" offset="3927124">We submit the Court below rested on the naked language of the statute and failed to carry out the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.579" offset="3953664">Now, third, a proscribed object such as the statute says that one of them is seize doing business, need not be the only or even the predominant object to bring conduct within the ban of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="980.621" offset="4025866">The Court below made much of the fact that, after all, the real goal of the Union here in all its activities against all the employers was not to bring about a permanent cessation of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.657" offset="4069961">What they wanted was the work that White wasn’t giving to them, and that the real object, the real goal was to get the neutrals, the secondaries to pressure the primary into hiring Operating Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.941" offset="4127117">That was the burden of the opinion of the Court below, and we concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.327" offset="4148642">The Board so found, and the finding was the crux of a Section 8 (b) 4 (b) holding, but Denver Building again was the first of a long line of cases establishing that it is efficient, as the Board here found, if a cessation of business was an additional object, an object of the Union’s conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.380" offset="4252923">And this Court, again, pointed out in these two cases that come to mind immediately, that Congress deliberately substituted the words “an object,” for the original bill which was condemned when you did-- when you exerted coercive pressures for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.858" offset="4334843">They thought that was too limited and substituted the words “an object” and, plainly, an “object of the Union’s conduct” here was to bring out about the kind of disruptions of business, the kind of work stoppages, such work stoppages as would be appropriate or necessary to achieve its goal either of obtaining that work from White or conceivably from a more compliant subcontractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.173" offset="6420041">I really submit that this type of boycott we find in this case, the ultimate objection of the Union and there were a lot of objectives to get more members, that the type of boycott we’ve got in this case, which is typical of the many case we have which arise in the construction industry, might more nearly be described as a classical boycott as the one the Court below described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.131" offset="6515858">Now, one very important caveat, we are confining this analysis to situations, whereas in the instant case, the thrust of the Union’s conduct is directed at secondary neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.698" offset="6594121">We recognize that primary strikes and primary picketing which are protected have secondary impacts, and this Court has noted that again in International Rice Milling and in the National Woodwork case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.624" offset="6661831">And, primary strikes are protected under the statutory scheme, notwithstanding, that they necessarily even have intended secondary impacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.907" offset="6699029">We recognize also, as a responded Union urges and the AFL-CIO urges, as amicus, argues, we recognize that Congress created no sweeping prohibition even of secondary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.270" offset="6752423">We don’t want to clinch on these limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.370" offset="6760887">We limit ourselves to the case where the impact is purely and expressly on secondary employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.496" offset="7117406">They are still in the process of developing some permanent water discharge lines to this project, and Phase II is about to start within the next couple of months.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.844" offset="7310712">I think, perhaps what Mr. Ordman meant to suggest was that the underlying jurisdictional controversy with regard to electric welding machines has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.341" offset="7352717">We have an affirmative decision on that by the Joint Board which is the equivalent of a 10K determination by the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.606" offset="7377795">Consequently, that specific type of controversy is resolved, but the secondary boycott conduct of this Union, which it has continually engaged in over the years, is still important and it still is outstanding a broad Third Circuit Court injunction prohibiting-- a permanent injunction prohibiting secondary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.812" offset="7454595">So that, the question involved here is most significant with regard to that outstanding secondary boycott order in other cases, which are cited in our brief, and for all future violations that come under the ambit of this section of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.007" offset="8167424">As Mr. Ordman has pointed out, the cessation of business interpretation of the statute is at the heart of the Third Circuit opinion and I would submit that the Third Circuit was very conscious of its narrow interpretation of this language because, in its opinion, it alludes to and cites for comparison the Fifth Circuit decision in a Carpenter’s District Council of New Orleans which we have cited, and the Fifth Circuit, of course, adopts the Board ruling that something less than a total cancellation of business is a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.080" offset="8311724">Provisionally, as I understand and read that decision in the Third Circuit, it would virtually make, as the Third Circuit has interpreted this statute, the evidentiary standard of demonstrating an unlawful object virtually impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.313" offset="8376613">I think the Courts and the Board have held many times that it is the purpose of the conduct and not its effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.978" offset="8427290">There can be unlawful thread with an improper object that does not meet with success.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.077" offset="8451636">However it is, nonetheless, unlawful, and I would point to the language of this Court in the General Electric case in which this Court said that, in the absence of admissions by the Union of an illegal intent, the nature of acts performed shows the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.973" offset="8527287">It cannot be gain said, of course, that a Union hardly will step forward and admit illegal intent, but I think the Courts and the Board, over the years, have developed reasonable criteria and reasonable methods of finding out what this intent is and it is demonstrated by that citation adopted by this Court in General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.296" offset="8628537">It seems to me that in the development of our labor law, if we look to the pre-Norris-LaGuardia type of labor disputes, with the use of injunctive power that has been criticized in the development of our law, we then look to Norris-LaGuardia which endeavored to stop that type of abuse of judicial injunctive process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.958" offset="8767195">I submit that the purpose in the development of all of this law was to confine the area of industrial conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.097" offset="8795721">The purpose was to reduce or minimize the disruption of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.008" offset="8823411">In a same fashion, the Boy’s Market decision of this Court in June of this year endeavors to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.857" offset="8850787">So that, consequently, we find the emphasis in the development of our labor law an effort to confine the conflict and I would submit that if the decision of the Third Circuit were adopted here, it would so enlarge the battle field as to undo the years of development of this law, the legislative history, the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.854" offset="8938768">Indeed, we point out in our brief the Building Trade Unions have tried perennially to obtain a Common Situs Bill in Congress that would allow the very type of conduct engaged in here has turned back that effort each time and, consequently, the Third Circuit position, it seems to me, should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.076" offset="9031659">The Union has available to it the collective bargaining-- free collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.259" offset="9052453">In that process, it has available to it arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.402" offset="9064991">The Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes is a type of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.893" offset="9082964">It has been so held the Union in this instance, as Mr. Ordman points out, rejected that procedure though bound by it, rejected the conclusion of that body though bound by it, and it was necessary to obtain injunctive relief for the enforcement of that type of award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.635" offset="9157883">Moreover, not only did it reject the arbitration procedure and result it was bound by, but it did so by engaging in coercive activities against neutrals, not involved in the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.046" offset="9211591">Poirier &amp; McLane had no dispute with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.824" offset="9222666">Chicago Bridge had no dispute with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.942" offset="9235101">Burns &amp; Roe had no dispute with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.100" offset="9247744">Consequently, if we squarely recognize the realities of the construction industry, here, we see a $68-million project where 30 men operating engineers all refuse to work, leave their equipment and, by their refusal, bring to an absolute standstill a project employing some-300 men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.583" offset="9345755">Obviously, the statute is designed not only to protect the rights of the neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.221" offset="9368221">It was also intended to protect the rights of their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.722" offset="9386297">This dislocation-- this massive dislocation also causes injury to these other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.167" offset="9427989">I would submit that there were only three alternatives available with regard to the Union conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.754" offset="9478353">One of them was the parties could’ve remained adamant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.373" offset="9492877">No one would’ve changed their stand and, perhaps, the project might not be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.376" offset="9516910">In the absence of injunctive relief, the project would not have resumed, except for that injunctive relief in the manner that it was proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.692" offset="9558183">The other alternative was to terminate the contract of White Construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.962" offset="9575215">That is not as simple a thing as it sounds. Certainly, in sophisticated types of construction such as a nuclear plant, it is not a simple thing to switch horses, midstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.022" offset="9627460">There are all types of problems with regard to competence, personnel, planning, approval of drawings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.814" offset="9658598">The other alternative, of course, was to exert this pressure until the Union had the White Construction Company bend to its will, and it seems to me that the reasonable course here dictates in what Congress intended to do was to deal with the normal type of dispute, the interdiction or, if you will, the disruption of business designed to put pressure on people who could bring about a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.502" offset="9777403">These are the neutrals that are to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.793" offset="9790568">The respondent’s brief relies upon two cases rather heavily, the Miller case and the Wed Nagle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.367" offset="9812825">With regard to Miller, it seems to me that that case is in opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.635" offset="9825886">The Miller case, if we read the language of it clearly, indicates that that merely was an effort by a Union to tell a general contractor that if a painting subcontractor continued to resort to the use of spray-painting it would picket the job and clearly indicate that its dispute was with the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.268" offset="9900492">That case did not involve secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.129" offset="9911881">In that opinion, it was clearly pointed out that the superintendent of the general contractor admitted that the Union agent never specifically asked him to remove Miller from the job or take any other definitive action in regard to Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.909" offset="9967052">We said that that case is in opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.030" offset="9975515">With regard to Wed Nagle, Wed Nagle was a Seventh Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.087" offset="9983770">Wed Nagle was decided in 1958, I think as our brief cites, the Seventh Circuit has rejected that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.615" offset="10029850">We cite the Pure Milk decision, which is a Seventh Circuit decision, decided in 1964 and I would call the Court’s particular attention to the italics in a quotation in our brief at page 26 in which the Seventh Circuit says “less than a total cessation of an existing business relationship is within the meaning of seize doing business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.854" offset="10122742">Consequently, we would submit that the Wood Neagle case is rejected authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.196" offset="10148133">Obviously, when a Union engages in this conduct, it may have several objects and we have cited the cases talking about those decisions which have immediate alternative conditional or ultimate objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.362" offset="10200795">The point that Mr. Ordman makes is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.398" offset="10212916">The legislative history shows clearly that the language of “the purpose of” was substituted with the language of “an object” and, consequently, the broader language has application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.977" offset="10259310">With regard to the contention made by the respondents that 8 (b) 4 (d) is involved here and, therefore, we should not have an 8 (b) 4 (b) charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.167" offset="10296090">Needless to say, the 8 (b) 4 (b) Section, the secondary boycott section, involves mandatory injunctive powers as opposed to discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.935" offset="10331094">There’s a Section 303 suit that can be instituted by anyone who is injured by secondary conduct, irrespective of a contractual relationship which underscores Congress’ concern for neutrals and underscores its concern for prevention of a disruption of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.010" offset="10403401">Moreover, after a 10k award under NLRB procedures, an injunction may be dissolved, whereas in secondary boycott matters, the injunction becomes permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.438" offset="10457109">This case, I would submit, is like the Denver Building Trades case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.622" offset="10477902">We have the pressures brought to bear on a general and other subs to have White change its course, to have White change the method by which it was doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.752" offset="10522415">This, indeed, was a longstanding dispute, has been a longstanding dispute between Local 825 and other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.584" offset="10549687">There are cases, the Building Contractors case of 1957 quoted in our brief, the Moore Pipe decision in 1962, the Building Contractors again in 1964, and Moore Interaction in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.203" offset="10596185">All of these secondary boycott cases involved the welding machine and I would submit as well that there have been two contempts found by the Third Circuit with regard to violation of its order on secondary boycotts by this Union on welding machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.946" offset="10659192">In short, I would conclude that the nature of the construction industry is such that, without applying the sound principles of Denver Building Trades and all of the decision subsequent, it would unduly enlarge the battlefield and grant to construction Unions what they have not been able to obtain to the common situs legislation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl S. Aronson</label>
            <text syncTime="2673.010" offset="10795447">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.406" offset="10800985">Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.392" offset="10824913">First, let me say, initially, it is a great honor for me to appear before this Court with such distinguished adversaries and in such splendor, and it is a day that I shall treasure for the rest of my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.851" offset="10890742">With respect to the arguments of counsel for both the National Labor Relations Board and for the charging parties, there is some agreement on behalf of the respondent Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.180" offset="10944136">There is more disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.792" offset="10954585">With respect to the basic facts which gave rise to the instant dispute, I am in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.248" offset="10988335">There is no question there were two work stoppages which the National Labor Relations Board, in its decision, found to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.775" offset="11026474">With respect to the fact that all of the employers are neutral employers at the job site involved, I am in complete disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.272" offset="11080495">The National Labor Relations Act requires, with respect to Section 8 (b) 4 (b), that in addition to engaging in certain proscribed conduct, that conduct be engaged in for a certain specific objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.899" offset="11158967">As it relates to this case, that objective is to force one employer to seize doing business with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.622" offset="11193866">There is nothing in the statute itself or in the legislative history preceding the passage of the statute which sets forth that Congress desired to have a sweeping prohibition against all secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.912" offset="11270980">This Court so recognizes this contention and in the General Electric Case, among others, it so stated that the only areas of prohibition are those areas which are set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.113" offset="11335868">Now, if the Board is correct in its interpretation of the statute, it can state that in every secondary situation per se, there must be found an illegal seize doing business objective if the form of the coercive pressure takes that of a strike or a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.708" offset="11438164">I submit that the form of the pressure is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.050" offset="11455613">It is the objective that the Union desires which leads to the ultimate conclusion, is this activity to force one employer to seize doing business with another?</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.565" offset="11521651">This is a factual question, I submit to the Court, as to whether a Union engages in conduct for a proscribed objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.004" offset="11567417">The National Labor Relations Board in its decision reversed the trial examiner who held that there was not a saintlier of evidence in the record to establish that the local Union involved designed to seize anyone to seize doing business with anyone but, rather, all they wanted was that White assign a certain man, member of the local, to the operation and maintenance of a welding machine or, further, that White and/or Burns &amp; Roe execute a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.425" offset="11725093">There is nothing improper, I submit, for a Union to request or demand or even strike to force an employer to execute a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.560" offset="11773576">However, the Board in its decision sets forth no specific factual determination which can support the conclusion that it finds, namely that this conduct is to force one employer to seize doing business with another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.395" offset="11896978">My client was seeking to have Union conditions uniform throughout this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.401" offset="11928952">White was not complying with what, in my client’s opinion, were the uniform conditions on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.366" offset="11960822">It, thereafter, went to Burns who is the general contractor, who is not a completely disinterested party, who in fact is so interested that it submitted this dispute to the National Joint Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.563" offset="12025605">Initially, it went to Burns to advise that it was having difficulty with White, that White was not complying with the terms of the Union conditions in the area and that it wanted White to put a man on the welding machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.463" offset="12089240">The general contractor was asked to sign a collective bargaining agreement, which is not unusual in the building and construction industry, and he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.430" offset="12129050">The Union was seeking to have Burns &amp; Roe, the general contractor, exercise its influence over White so that White would put a member of the Operating Engineers on the welding machine, rather than an Iron Worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.946" offset="12195192">This was precisely the object that the Union sought in the Wend Nagle case in the Seventh Circuit, and the Court there stated that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.116" offset="12247855">This is not a seize doing business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.731" offset="12258304">Maybe if there are strikes and pressure it’s an illegal jurisdictional dispute, and I do not argue that point here, but it is not a seize doing business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.252" offset="12304384">It would have served no purpose in this case to have the Union or the employer Burns, seize doing business with White. The trial examiner so found, the Union didn’t want White off the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.300" offset="12356524">As a matter of fact, White was never removed from the job and the two work stoppages involved a seize on or about October 11th of the year involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.341" offset="12404694">White stayed on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.816" offset="12410650">There were subsequent jurisdictional dispute work stoppages, but that was all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.819" offset="12450670">Yes, I am, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.124" offset="12455894">I’m challenging them because when the case was submitted to the Court below, and I believe that both counsel misinterpreted the holding of the Court below, nowhere in the decision of the Court below does it state “there must be a total cessation of business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.461" offset="12521200">What the Court below says, as I read its opinion, is that if the form of coercive activity takes that of a work stoppage, that in it of itself, “without Moore,” is insufficient to establish a seize doing business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.025" offset="12603434">The “without Moore,” which the Board and counsel would ask be found as a matter of law, is the crucial fact, the fact which this Court found in Denver not by implication but as a matter of fact, the Union said “we don’t want them on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.056" offset="12671561">We want to get rid of his business” which the Court found, as a matter of fact, in the following two cases which were decided the same day that Denver was, the Board says “this is what the Union must have wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.756" offset="12734360">This is the only alternative to the primary employer exceeding to the Union’s demands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.100" offset="12759751">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.357" offset="12764766">That is pure conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.073" offset="12771662">It very well may be that the general contractor will remove the primary from the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.804" offset="12802591">That might happen, but the mere fact that it might happen does not mean that the Union desired that that would happen or had the remotest wanting for that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.720" offset="12858284">The mere fact that, at times, there are incidental effects to activity does not necessarily follow that that is the desired effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.934" offset="12911156">Are you suggesting that, on this record, if that had occurred, it would be an incidental effect which the Union had never intended?</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.480" offset="12953266">I suggest that because that was not the only alternative opened to Burns &amp; Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.370" offset="12980851">If the Union, and there are Unions and there are cases and the Board decisions are rife with these cases, goes to the general contractor and says to the general “I want you to utilize your influence upon the subcontractor to have him comply and, if you can’t do it, I want you to bounce him off the job,” then we have no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.295" offset="13068518">We have then the Union stating what its alternative objective and that which it desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.278" offset="13092446">But, in this case, one, White did not put a man on the welding machine, two, he was not removed from the job, and three, the Union never asked that he’d be removed from the job or in fact is there any evidence to show that it desired he’d be removed from the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.817" offset="13162663">The findings of fact of the trial examiner which the Board completely disregards and just substitutes its own finding as a conclusion, establish that the Union didn’t want White removed from the job as it would’ve served absolutely no useful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.092" offset="13239777">Again, in contradiction to the Board’s argument of per se, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Retail Clerks case, which is cited in my brief, also refused to accept the Board’s per se argument that every time a Union engages in secondary activity, it must be for a seize doing business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.065" offset="13351581">In that case, the Union was seeking to force the primary employer to recognize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.403" offset="13373001">The statute prohibits secondary activity for that purpose, and the Board contended to the Court, if the evidence establishes that the Union engaged in conduct, secondary, to force the primary to recognize it, as a matter of law, it must be found that the Union engaged in the conduct also to force the secondary to seize doing business with the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.230" offset="13472266">The Court rejected the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.712" offset="13478222">It said it could visualize situations where a Union might seek recognition but not a cessation of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.156" offset="13511973">With respect to the argument that a change in business operations, such as the imposition upon White of an obligation to put an Operating Engineer on its payroll to operate a welding machine, is the equivalent of a seize doing business objective is an exaggeration of this statute beyond means and compare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.854" offset="13634748">There is absolutely nothing to show that Congress ever intended a change in business operations to be proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.610" offset="13673827">Had it so intended, it would’ve stated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.364" offset="13688874">It only proscribed a seize doing business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.279" offset="13708518">There is an important area of disagreement, and that is the neutrality of the employers involved on the particular job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.169" offset="13756061">There is no evidence in this record that the Union extended any work stoppages or any threats beyond the confines of this job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.039" offset="13807574">The Denver case has been in existence since approximately 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.480" offset="13837249">However, its principles do not, in my opinion, conclusively establish that the mere fact that there are independent corporations, independent contractors on a construction site, that that alone means that they are neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.621" offset="13913840">I believe that the principle set forth by the petitioners has been altered by this Court in the General Electric case and in the Carrier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.803" offset="13962533">In those cases, although they involved separate gate picketing which is not involved in this case, but the principle remains the same because if the proviso to Section 8 (b) 4 has any meaning, it means that it’s a primary strike, there are primary picketing, picketing situation is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.330" offset="14044662">In those cases, we had independent contractors at the same job location and this Court developed the normal operations test to conclude whether the employers were in actuality neutrals, secondaries, and whether the Union’s right to extend its dispute to these other employers was protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.029" offset="14159496">The Board does not apply the normal operations test to the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.450" offset="14193142">It utilizes a foreign test, that is, you’re an independent contractor, therefore, you are neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.836" offset="14222712">It closes its eyes, I submit, to the realities of the construction industry and, as pointed out by this case, it claims that Burns was a neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.822" offset="14274644">Burns had more interest in this job site, I submit, than any employer located thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.921" offset="14299094">He was the general contractor, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.372" offset="14312887">Number two, Burns was the one who could have bound White by executing a contract with a legal subcontractor clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.459" offset="14357191">Number three, it was Burns who submitted the dispute to National Joint Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.779" offset="14386448">Now, the NLRB’s decision does not go into or discuss in any way factually what the operations of these employers were in relation to each other at the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.706" offset="14450186">If it is permitted to disregard the Carrier case and the General Electric case, it will be discriminating against Unions in the construction industry because there is nothing in the statute which states that Unions or employers in the construction industry are under a different set of rules than Unions in industrial plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.594" offset="14557706">There is further support for this type of an argument concerning the non-neutrality of employers on the same construction site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.736" offset="14602324">In Board Member Fanning’s decisions, he, when there is a jurisdictional dispute and a secondary boycott, if you will, holds that the finding of a jurisdictional dispute precludes the finding of a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.909" offset="14670973">But, he also states that, in jurisdictional dispute situations, it is clear that the concept, primary and secondary, is unreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.497" offset="14717367">That, in a jurisdictional dispute situation, a Union should have the right to exert whatever pressure it has to in support of its jurisdictional claim upon all of the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.573" offset="14773687">Because of the interrelationship he, in effect, applies the normal operations test to the situation, as this Court did in the Carrier and General Electric cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4899.861" offset="19702784">I think Mr. Gold has conceded the fact that the cessation of business can be something less than total and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.087" offset="19731728">I merely to-- wish to observe that his definition of this question of something being economically disadvantageous to the neutral is something new that our Courts have not adopted, and I would submit that there were many subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.619" offset="19781883">They came on this site under Burns &amp; Roe, subsequent to these three and the economic disadvantageous definition, which has never been adopted, no legislative history to support, ignores: one, they were economically damaged by having their jobs stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.283" offset="19844472">These men have superintendents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.516" offset="19849488">They have equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.240" offset="19852309">They have running expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.378" offset="19856906">They were economically damaged, irrespective of what would happen with the welding machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.996" offset="19871326">Moreover, the Joint Board procedure and the appendix indicates clearly that under the Engineer’s contract, which is in the appendix at page 324, says that with regard to that Joint Board procedure which bound all of these employers, that the last known job decision must be followed by each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.712" offset="19946245">Consequently, if the Engineers had won this particular type of dispute, that would have been a condition that would have to have been accepted by Burns and any of his sub and, consequently, it would’ve been economically disadvantageous.</text>
