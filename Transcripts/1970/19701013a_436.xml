            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="78.046" offset="415535">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.028" offset="431522">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.768" offset="454405">The area under consideration is Metropolitan Mobile which is portrayed on this map behind me with a school population in excess of 50,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.492" offset="505292">This 50,000 is out of a total Mobile County school population of approximately 70,000 students. The black-white ratio in metropolitan Mobile is almost exactly 50-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.826" offset="562657">In the system as a whole, city and rural, the black-white ratio is about 60% white, 40,000 students, 40% black, 30,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.533" offset="609468">85% of the black students were about 26,000 in the system reside in metropolitan Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.972" offset="639248">At all stages of the litigation, the Courts and the parties including the school board have treated metropolitan Mobile as a separate matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.821" offset="674670">The proceedings which have resulted in this writ of certiorari focus on integration of the elementary schools in metropolitan Mobile although facts just furnished to us by respondents and set forth in a supplemental brief filed Saturday indicates the junior high schools and the high schools there in which a substantial degree of integration was supposed to have been accomplished are in very substantial measure identifiably black.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.621" offset="793893">The question presented to this Court is whether in this school system, where the entire spectrum of school assignment techniques have been used in the past to maintain racial segregation, noncontiguous zoning, satellite zoning, pairing, busing, a bewildering array of deviations in grade, structure, portable classrooms, school closings, school construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.116" offset="903816">Whether those techniques, which have been employed in the service of segregation now ought to be used in the service of integration or is the sole standard to be an innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.342" offset="952717">That is the exclusive employment of the neighborhood school, whatever that means, now suggested by the United State’s and the respondents as a method of school assignment even though it results in an exceedingly high degree of racial concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.314" offset="1016665">Some children have, in the past in Mobile sometimes been assigned on the basis of some concept of neighborhood among a number of other assignment factors, but as the sole means of assignment, it is an innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.774" offset="1078418">It might be added at this point, at least I would like to add at this point parenthetically an answer to the argument which emerges from this sharp departure in administration which was anticipated yesterday by counsel for the Charlotte School Board who stated and by Mr. Blake who stated today two wrongs do not make a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.964" offset="1159189">That seems to be the only answer to this series of facts which exists here in Mobile and in the other case, the other case argued earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.095" offset="1195760">He conceded two wrongs do not make a right was the only answer and however satisfying that aphorism might be, a brief analysis of it, we submit, illuminates the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.370" offset="1240900">Busing to segregate was indeed wrong so was noncontiguous zoning, portable classrooms and so forth but the wrong was not the busing or the zoning, it was the racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.714" offset="1302235">These assignment techniques were normal, neutral, administrative means of implementing a governmental policy, in this case an unconstitutional governmental policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.385" offset="1348942">Similarly, transportation and the various other aids of school assignment in the service of integration are neither good nor bad, it considered abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.613" offset="1385827">They are similarly instruments in the service of disestablishing an unconstitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.167" offset="1416025">The question under review is this Court’s judgment of June -- is the Fifth Circuit’s judgment of June 8, 1970 as modified by judgments of August 4 and August 28, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.468" offset="1477256">These were the ninth, tenth and eleventh appeals to the Fifth Circuit since 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.904" offset="1502960">The case is now pending there on further appeal, having to do with enforcement of the transportation and faculty portions of the earlier decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.871" offset="1538905">It has been before the District Court and the Court of Appeals a sufficient number of times so that the docket entries alone occupy half of the first volume of this record and throughout these proceedings, a vast quantity of materials have accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.629" offset="1601912">Nevertheless, the salient facts are clear and they are not complex and the issues confronting the Court are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.061" offset="1631587">The essence of the problem is revealed in statistics filed by the respondent in the District Court on October 2nd, a week ago, last Friday and not I may add served on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.224" offset="1676309">Respondent’s document has been reproduced in our supplemental brief, filed with the Court on October 10th and analyzing the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.859" offset="1702849">It is a photocopy of their document in our own brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.548" offset="1717582">And what I am about to describe is the board’s own statistics although we submit that upon an evidentiary hearing we could demonstrate to the facts are far worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.377" offset="1764916">The Fifth Circuit plan in operation according to their statistics, results in 7,651 or about two thirds of all the Negro school children of metropolitan Mobile attending all black elementary schools using the Fifth Circuit’s definition of an all black school as one with fewer than 10% white students.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.756" offset="1858435">This map of metropolitan Mobile indicates the elementary school districts in that portion of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.007" offset="1887378">It is approximately 10 miles across the west and 18 miles from north to south.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.339" offset="1912769">Almost all black children are separated from the preponderant white portion of the city by interstate 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.170" offset="1944012">This is the separating line, this is the black section, this is the white section.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.633" offset="1965955">The all black zones now on their own admissions include Robins which is all black, Grant which is all black, Brazier which is all black, Palm (ph) which is all black, Stanton Road which is all black, Fonde which is all black, Owens which is all black, Collier (ph) which is all black, Council which is all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.607" offset="2053831">Then here is Whitley which is 89% blend, all black, 1% from the Fifth Circuit definition and other schools ranging from 64, 76 and 80% black.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.895" offset="2102941">Now, these districts here, using again a definition of no more than 10% black students are all white.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.377" offset="2144841">Indian Springs all white, Forest Hill all white, Austin all white, Fonde all white, Shepherd all white, Morningside all white, Merck is all white, Westmont all white, Williams all white.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.658" offset="2194056">Here is a district with 52% white drawn from an all black enclave here, but for many years there was the only one to 12 school in the system, the school being one to 12 so that it would absorb all the black children in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.163" offset="2256018">The school is closed and now they go to school over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.377" offset="2284857">There are in fact some small percentage of white students living in some of the 90% to more black districts, but under the plan, as it is operated, as the respondents have informed the District Court for reasons that we do not know, not all of them and perhaps none of them are attending the schools to which they are assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.716" offset="2358209">There is a motion pending in the District Court about that but we have not been able to get a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.343" offset="2380779">Moreover, the petition which we took to this Court involves only elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.854" offset="2398751">The high school situation, however, under actual enrollment figures now furnished seems far worse than projected in the government’s plan which is essentially adopted below.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.757" offset="2442428">As page three of our supplemental brief indicates, more than 6700 Negro students will be going to high school and junior high school in all black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.824" offset="2478686">Therefore, we have a situation in which the preponderant number of black students in metropolitan Mobile will be spending half of their education, the elementary years in all black schools and the so called palliative of integrated junior high and high school education which does not, in any event cure denial of constitutional rights for the first six years, will in fact not exist for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.739" offset="2578369">And the issue is, does this final, this is a final desegregation plan, does it satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="626.730" offset="2610343">The Fourteenth Amendment rule as most recently been expounded in Green and Alexander as requiring the ending of the last vestiges of segregation and the elimination of segregation, root and branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.874" offset="2666872">And we submit that that imperative is far, exceedingly far from having been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.946" offset="2695189">Now the justification offered by respondent and the United States for leaving racial segregation essentially intact in metropolitan Mobile is that the result is required by neighborhood schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.165" offset="2748061">In assessing the so-called neighborhood school zoning of Mobile, we might however first describe the methods of school zoning which Mobile has used traditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.801" offset="2790588">On this record, the school district buses more than 20,000 students at an average round trip of 30 miles a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.388" offset="2824965">Most of the busing is in the rural area, but there is a substantial amount at shorter distances in the city and so busing is hardly foreign to Mobile education and this figure compares fairly well with the fact that 40% of all American school children are bused to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.412" offset="2889017">Some of this busing has clearly been for the purpose of maintaining racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.440" offset="2909184">As for example, when approximately 600 black students were bused from rural Saraland down to around this area to an all black school.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.613" offset="2949831">Approximately 7000 students in the western part of Mobile over here, it’s in the metropolitan area, are bused where the school districts are large and the distances are somewhat greater and the preponderant part of the white population lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.205" offset="3008240">But the point is that busing is common place in Mobile education.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.318" offset="3028616">Mobile has in the past regularly used noncontiguous zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.336" offset="3048678">I would like to ask the Court to turn to pages 7 (a) that’s in the appendix to our brief and look at the two pages of colored maps there.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.290" offset="3120567">These maps were prepared by the United States and have been adopted from their appendix in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.910" offset="3159019">The zones on the map are colored in a way so that all parts of a noncontiguous zone are the same color and some of these involve so called satellite zoning and some of it involves noncontiguous pairing.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.146" offset="3215966">It can be seen at a glance that Mobile has assigned children to schools on anything but a neighborhood basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.189" offset="3248149">The difference is of course this map depicts a period in which noncontiguous zoning was used to maintain racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.025" offset="3275421">On the first page, for example, the bright pink portions constitute a single school zone in which black children were bused in the northern part of the zone to the pink semi-circular sections in the right side which is the Saraland situation I was describing a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.455" offset="3341145">White children attended a single school from the blue portion of the map, that being satellite zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.747" offset="3366327">There was a school in one part, but not in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.643" offset="3377925">But the corridor between the two sections called Thomas was formed because blacks lived in there and they were not to go to the white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.905" offset="3415019">On the next page, the bright red portions of the map, again just taking an example, constitute a white school zone and white children at Brookley went up to the white school at Woodcock.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.126" offset="3899852">If you will turn there, there is a list with a single spaced page of rather small type which lists all the noncontiguous zones which existed in the Mobile school system and by year, the ’63, ’64, ’65, ’65, ’66, ’67 that's as of the time when that record was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.136" offset="3983966">Now, if this analysis of the last five minutes is not completely laid to rest the fact that there is nothing to the notion of neighborhood schools in Mobile, I would like to add that in the black areas, whenever they had a school where the capacity of the school is filled up by black children, they wanted to put more blacks in, they added portable classrooms and the records show that with respect to white children, they did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.924" offset="4075081">The capacity of a school can determine the neighborhood it will serve, but where the capacity of a school is a readily expandable thing like an accordion, almost it’s like an Alice in Wonderland, what is the capacity of the school?</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.727" offset="4122311">The capacity of the school is whatever the decision of the school board decides that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.287" offset="4140492">In fact in Mobile, portable classrooms, the record shows, were substantially added to black schools while white schools were under capacity and this is shown by respondent’s report which is on page 208 of the appendix and in appendix D to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.767" offset="4210395">Appendix D to our brief has a list of portable classrooms and so the notion of neighborhood has somehow related to a fixed capacity of school while we would submit in no cases applicable here is ludicrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.617" offset="4281866">Another way school population is defined is by grade structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.602" offset="4297749">In this all black area over here, which is called Hillsdale, they had the only one to 12 school in the city of Mobile and I mentioned that earlier because that absorbs all the black kids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.852" offset="4338813">This, for example, only a K-3 school or a high school or junior high school, the black kids will then have to go to schools elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.816" offset="4366608">That school ultimately was closed, but it’s a normal and quite recent assignment practice of the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.000" offset="4399417">Elsewhere in this system, there is the most variegated combination of great structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.889" offset="4418957">An expert witness said he had never seen anything like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.471" offset="4433272">In our brief on page 35, there is just a summary of the great structures which they have used in 15, 16, 17, 18 19, 25, 67, 68, 69, 610, 612, 7, 78, 79, 711, 712, 812 and I am just picking them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.473" offset="4513311">In other words, the notion of neighborhood as determined by the capacity of a school serving a geographical area is even -- well, it is a concept that is really not capable of definition, certainly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.374" offset="4584887">We saw in the Swann case, the Charlotte case that what is claimed to be a neighborhood that is a contiguous zone can consist of something like the shape of a dumbbell, two large round areas are connected by a connecting bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.840" offset="4646745">The connecting bars in there, it's called a neighborhood and if you take that out, it's called noncontiguous zoning and not a neighborhood school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.498" offset="4673390">But the complexities and curiosities of the neighborhood school system in Mobile are even more fantastic than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.715" offset="4698258">The record will show that Mobile school officials define the neighborhood school not merely in geographical terms but in psychological and sociological terms as well, whatever that may mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.786" offset="4750503">The question for this Court therefore is whether in a school system, which has been segregated by law until 1954 and which remained completely segregated until 1969 and which is still now overwhelmingly segregated as the result of a so-called final desegregation plan under which it now operates, this Court, supervising District Courts sitting in equity should fashion an effective remedy to forever end the unconstitutional administration of the school system so far as race is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.519" offset="5469497">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to make several observations in an effort to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.085" offset="5499695">And one is, in a city like Mobile, indeed many communities which may come before a court or this Court, will have a situation in which the constitution has been violated without a doubt to their knowledge from 1954 to 1969 and it may be not asking too much to take another look at it again three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.323" offset="5592691">It’s not as if they have been thoroughly well integrated for a hundred years and then someone is suddenly calling them into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.329" offset="5624665">Secondly, it maybe that the Court will have to look at it as indeed in policing an antitrust decree or a water rights case or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.744" offset="5670327">So it is possible and then a judgment will have to be made on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.553" offset="5693628">As your question implies, will a period arrive sometime in history in which the Court will no longer ever have to look at it again, I imagine that at some point it would arrive, but now one year after Mobile has first taken a step going only as far as it has, I suggest, it's premature to consider that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.659" offset="5826017">So is it your position then that the Court has a duty to -- the school board in the first instance, the Court, the parties, must go in and see to it that adjustments are made to reflect the composition of the community, independent of any discriminatory motive?</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.788" offset="5946493">The school board is being asked to take affirmative action at this time to undo a long history of quite vigorously enforced discrimination and I think it -- we’re talking about a hypothetical case, I would assume that in a period of three years, the racial segregation which has been so virulent and has, as Mr. Napier (ph) said earlier, in a part of American history there is slavery for a hundred years and segregation for a hundred more, it may not be so easily uprooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.687" offset="6086092">It maybe the Court will have to look at it again and see whether or not this is just a natural movement of upward mobility to get a house with an additional bedroom or is related to something else.</text>
