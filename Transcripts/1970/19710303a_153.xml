            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="6.504" offset="130361">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.490" offset="154394">I think it’s fair to say that the appellants have taken brief and argued this appeal as if no evidence had been received and no record made in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.926" offset="240076">In effect, what they're asking this Court to do is to render an advisory opinion on a hypothetical caricature of what they call a “sectarian” institution of higher learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.890" offset="319906">Twice in their briefs and yesterday during oral argument counsel said, “What the court below has held is that an institution which admits only students of a particular religion, requires them to participate in religious activities, compels them to apply with the doctrines and darkness of the religion, forces them to attend church and does everything to propagate and advance a particular religion other than conferred degrees in divinity can constitutionally receive governmental funds so long as in its bookkeeping it allocates these funds to the construction of a chemistry laboratory or gymnasium.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.862" offset="511854">I say to the Court that the record will demonstrate that not a single one of those qualifications is germane or apposite to a single institution before this Court as appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.377" offset="573921">Nor do they make that contention because in the very next sentence they say, “We do not contend that any of the four institutional defendants here in 50 above composite description of sectarian educational institution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="135.153" offset="644974">Now, in the court below, the appellees called witnesses to the point of taxing the spirit of the cumulative evidence rule and of testing the patience of a three-judge court to show without contradiction without refutation and I say without cross-examination that first, the funded facilities of these schools were never used, are not being used for any religious worship, for any religious instruction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="620.681" offset="2587126">I think it would not require stepping in and it would require a lot of surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.178" offset="2609068">First of all, I don’t think it does violence presumptively to expect that these colleges and universities will deal with the Government in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.851" offset="2655775">Certainly, there would be no incentive to conduct religious worship or sectarian instruction in an expensive building devoted to science filled with laboratories or in a library when there are other buildings which fully serve that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.212" offset="2717215">But I would like to take Mr. Justice, that concave side of these convicts proposition and apply the Walz test is articulated by this Court to the statute we’re dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.915" offset="2772072">In Walz, there was a caveat.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.844" offset="2779805">A caveat that was supplementary to the purpose and primary effect test as I read that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.900" offset="2804046">The Court said, “We must look at primary effect and notice whether or not there is involved in excessive entanglement between state and religion, between church and state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.277" offset="2849499">Now, here there is the most perfunctory kind of surveillance that may take place in the event that a complaint is large that there was religion being conducted in one of these buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.570" offset="2886698">But let’s look at the other side, counsel for the appellants say and they say, we give that we concede that all church-related schools are not barred from this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.071" offset="2948660">Well, then what schools are barred?</text>
            <text syncTime="713.111" offset="2956810">The schools that are barred say they, the theory of our suit is that the Constitution forbids support by the federal government of any institution which teaches or practices religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.611" offset="3002890">Again, they said in the lower court, if the institution teaches or practices religion as to unconstitutional to allocated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.538" offset="3034551">In this Court they say, “We assert that under the Establishment Clause an institution is barred from receiving funds, if the propagation teaching or practice of religion is a meaningful and major part of its existence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="746.193" offset="3089199">So, what is the criterion that they urge?</text>
            <text syncTime="748.513" offset="3098499">They urged least throughout their briefs the Harshman test promulgated by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.909" offset="3139981">Now, what is the Harshman test?</text>
            <text syncTime="761.344" offset="3149803">It involves first of all a determination of the purpose of the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.656" offset="3167044">Second, it involves an analysis of the religious constituency of the governing board, the student body, the faculty and the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.108" offset="3212810">It involves a determination as to where the school gets its financial support whether religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.113" offset="3240814">Whether religion and prayer and meaningful and significant on these campuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.590" offset="3262757">Whether the activities of the alumni are really projections or extensions of the teachings of the school and what the image of the school is in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.527" offset="3306538">I suggest that to apply that test, that is being urged by the appellants is the very kind of entanglement that this Court eschewed and shunned and avoided in relationship to the ad valorem real estate tax test in Walz against the Tax Commission because it would require a constant surveillance to determine the ever-changing character institution of 817 church-related colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.613" offset="3426806">60% of the private schools in America today private higher educational institutions are church-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.679" offset="3463064">To take the appellants’ test would throw the whole administration of the higher education facilities act into chaos and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.321" offset="3497650">It would cast doubt over the eligibility for grants of 60% of the private higher educational institutions in the United States and introduce an amorphous test in capable of application without continuous surveillance as these schools change their character to meet the test imposed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.034" offset="3600572">So I suggest as against that Mr. Justice, as against that for which they contend that the kind of surveillance that is necessary to look at a building and seek whether or not in the building there is any religious instruction is de minimus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.852" offset="5059772">The maximum that they can receive is 33%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.338" offset="5845744">That the purpose and primary effect test presumes that there may be some incidental benefit to religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.567" offset="5938636">Again, this Court has said on three occasions clearly and unambiguously that the mandate of the Constitution in the Establishment Clause is not that the Government must be hostile to religion, but that it must be neutral as between religion and irreligion and as among the sex of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.873" offset="6027870">It said this in Everson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.893" offset="6043961">It said it in Zorach against Clauson, and it said it in Abington against Schempp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.988" offset="6072383">Clearly, I suggest to the Court that if the Congress had gerrymandered the church related schools out of this Bill by virtue of the fact that they were teaching religion or by virtue of the fact that worship was taking place on the campus that it would have manifested a constitutionally inhibited hostility to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.157" offset="6176977">Now, again this Court has said and it has said three times in applying the purpose and primary effect test that the focus in determining the effect, the focus in determining the secularity of the effect is not on the nature of the institution receiving the benefit but it’s on the function being subsidized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.320" offset="6281676">It said it in Everson and it said it in McCollum against the Board of Education which struck down a prayer program or a religious instruction program on the premises of the Illinois school system because it focused on the function being subsidized, not on the nature of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.272" offset="6361506">And finally, it said in Board of Education against Allen that it’s the function being subsidized that is to determinative de facto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.294" offset="6397555">So, I suggest here, you have a wholly secular function that is receiving a grant in part for the purpose of its erection and that it clearly passes the purpose and primary effect test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.842" offset="7467739">First, I find it necessary to correct a statement on test made by Mr. Williams and I do it so because it is critical to this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.423" offset="7514133">Mr. Williams said that the statute requires the institutions to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which forbids all form of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.167" offset="7565019">And Mr. Williams is in error, it does not forbid all forms of discrimination, it does permit religious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.110" offset="7596784">It forbids discrimination on race, color, or national origin but it does permit, if the word “religion” was deliberately taken off, it does permit religious discrimination, it does permit the use of federal funds to finance an institution which discriminate religiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.890" offset="7683929">This is critical to this case because they pointed out the difference between Bradfield, difference to all these cases is that this case allows an institution to discriminate religiously to exclude a religious basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.035" offset="7748504">I also want to state and make clear our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.390" offset="7761983">We do not concede any fact other than the fact that the institutions which are Connecticut or all over the United States do make a written commitment that in the particular facilities by that they will not teach or practice religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.620" offset="7834917">We do not agree with Mr. Williams’ interpretation of the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.761" offset="7851426">We have here, we prepared shot so our analysis of the evidence which reads conclusive directly contrary to Mr. Williams, we didn’t bring them here because there’d be no findings of fact, we don’t believe this is a trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.168" offset="7917046">There is -- was a great dispute in the court below between valid evidences relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.057" offset="7940660">We contended the element was relevant with that which dealt with the time when the grants to these institutions were authorized by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.599" offset="7982770">Most of the testimony the evidence put forth by Mr. Williams why we didn’t cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.023" offset="8004504">We objected to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.531" offset="8010564">Dealt with facts which occurred after, after those grants were authorized, which occurred up to date of trial and even which have been planned for future implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.419" offset="8058107">There were two different institutions in each case. One when the grant was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.765" offset="8079423">One when the trial was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.265" offset="8089454">We contend that the evidence which we present as of the time when the grants were authorized did justify a finding of fact that at least one or more of these institutions did exclude students who were not of the requisite phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.832" offset="8179733">Now, if the Court deems that to be a critical fact as I believe it is, I think the Court is not a trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.328" offset="8753695">The test is whether the facility is free standing or intergraded into the totality of a curriculum whereby the same student is exposed to the propagation of religion and the institution has its major partners to propagate religion to that student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.032" offset="8816494">What I mean by this is that if in order, if the services at the hospital are part of a unit which includes the inculcation of religious doctrine and the student and the patient must take both his treatment for his disease and propagation of religion, that’s unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.824" offset="8907713">That is a situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.239" offset="8917326">No person can walk off the street and comment and say, “I want to use this chemistry laboratory or in this biology laboratory or I want to enroll only for this one cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.193" offset="8961212">He is a complete student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.628" offset="8966959">He must take a whole works inc -- if he’s a catholic certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.399" offset="8982006">He must take the whole works including of course in the propagation of the catholic religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.286" offset="9001545">That, I believe is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.340" offset="9013770">Now one word about pertinence, we are in this Court because the Congress is coordinate branch of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.305" offset="9053581">This Court is of course bound by the Congress statement of pertinence -- I don’t believe that’s true in respect of States legislature but in respect to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.987" offset="9092347">But it must examine what the purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.514" offset="9106453">Mr. Friedman yesterday pointed out and the court below found that the purpose is to increase enrolment and the school is not to give additional facilities to anybody who wants those facilities but in order to increase enrolment in those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.478" offset="9166326">And you can do it Congress said, “By making these facilitates available so that in the enrolment of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.487" offset="9194329">I submit in all deference that taking just one of the institutions with Sacred Heart University just an illustration which is exhibit in the case its own statement of what its purposes are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.956" offset="9252216">On page 16, it says, “Convince of the necessity of a catholic education at every level for all catholic youth, the bishop who founded the Sacred Heart University shortly before the opening of (Inaudible) to announce that Sacred Heart University would be organized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.893" offset="9331942">He said, “It is a conviction of its founder and (Inaudible) major mission of the church can be carried on by laymen in the catholic university.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.561" offset="9366632">I submit if a purpose of an institution is to carry out the major mission of the church and funds are granted to that institution in order that it can expand its enrolment.</text>
