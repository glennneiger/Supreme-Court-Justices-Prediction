            <text syncTime="29.635" offset="221915">I would like to begin this morning by noting that there are many aspects of the Florida Educational Financing System which are very fine indeed and to the extent that they are good we applaud, but there is one element in this system which discriminates on the basis of wealth and to that extent we attack it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.499" offset="321390">Basically, the Florida system is this, the state distributes to each of the counties on a very fair and well considered basis, a major portion of the funds to finance a school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.055" offset="395577">Now, I am willing to assume here contrary to present fact that this is sufficient to fund an adequate educational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.721" offset="438209">Added to this basic grant and on top of this is the amount that the local counties add through their local tax effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.502" offset="477393">Now, I’m even willing to assume here that this added amount is an educational frosting.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.072" offset="559626">But we insist that even the frosting be distributed on an equal basis that is without discrimination based on wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.067" offset="607692">The Millage Rollback Act together with the statutes which authorized Florida counties to tax, create a system where they give to each county a certain authority to add this educational frosting, to raise these dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.646" offset="685955">In some counties, it’s $700.00 a pupil.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.457" offset="701210">In other counties, it’s $6.00, $5.00, $4.00 and down to $50.00 a pupil.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.180" offset="724093">Each is treated less well depending as it goes down the wealth scale so that it’s not a question of only two categories, it’s a sliding scale and everybody but the top county is disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.292" offset="800580">Now, we are not opposed to limitations as such on local effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.927" offset="831091">We don’t even insist on a particular formula that the limitation should take.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.050" offset="859617">There are variety of constitutional formulas, for example, a Florida could in its wisdom say that each county will be limited to a $100.00 a pupil or could say each county could be -- would be limited to a $1,000.00 in instruction unit of the instruction unit as was discussed yesterday is a very complicated formula which takes into account a myriad of factors, it could take -- if there are infinite number of reasonable formulas for determining instruction units, to take account of any reasonable difference in educational need, transportation, exceptional children, guidance programs, anything so that we wouldn’t object to any limitation which applied without regard to wealth which was reasonably related to the responsibility which each of the local communities has and if they have the same responsibility, it is our position that the state must give them the same tools to meet that responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.406" offset="1425011">Your Honor, I respectfully disagree that it’s equal on its face, it’s equal and that it says that the same number, flat tax rate is applicable but I think the Court must ask the question, how does this operate, does it operate equally or unequally.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.065" offset="1487600">Let me, if I may put a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.067" offset="1499617">Instead of -- in this case where we have the state giving to the local communities tax authorization, let’s consider the case where the state was giving money for educational purposes and suppose that the formula which that they distributed money was the same as they distribute tax authority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.471" offset="1577253">And suppose that the state of Florida said that we will give to each county 10 mills, a percentage of its tax base for educational purposes and there’s no doubt in my mind that this Court would strike that down nine to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.772" offset="1662412">That has no relationship to the educational task that the counties are required to undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.476" offset="1709328">Now, the State of Florida in its presentation nor in its briefs has suggested a single reason why an equal limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.402" offset="1753004">If an equal limitation -- if they want a limitation, why an equal limitation would not serve all of its purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="420.705" offset="1786232">The state suggested yesterday that the Millage Rollback Act narrows the gap between the poor counties and the rich counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.542" offset="1825520">I think it is obviously true that it narrows the potential gap that is to say that there’s a limit of 10 mils on each county, the potential gap is less than if there’s a limitation of 15 mills and a limitation of 15 mills creates less of a potential gap than no limitation at all but the question that we urge on the Court is not the validity of a limitation, it’s the validity of unequal wealth related limitation expressed as a flat rate tax limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.900" offset="4066931">And here, were talking - there’s a big difference and I think its important to maintain the distinction between getting the money in whether the state is treating someone equally in the way its taxing, from a taxpayers point of view and on the other hand, whether the state is distributing its large or its benefits unequally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.071" offset="4159613">And here, we claim that the state is distributing its benefits unequally, not money but in this case authority to tax, and I think it is a discrete part of the taxing system in Florida and of course it could be met if Florida was to come in here and say yes, its true that it does operate unequally but we have made it up by this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.768" offset="7222418">I think it’d be very foolish and unwise but if they authorize the localities, it can be argued that they are discriminating on the basis of an ability to pay and the poor ones can’t afford it, but even if that is alright and I’m willing to assume for the purposes of this case that it is alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.504" offset="7293367">They can’t say for example if they abolish all schools and live it up to the locality, they can’t say to the rich locality, well, you can have a school with $1,500.00 a pupil in it and say to the poor county, you’re poor and for that reason we won’t let you have a $1,500.00 school system, we’ll only let you have a $500.00 school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.952" offset="7395140">And the difference is that in the second case I put, the state is forbidding the poor from doing the same thing as the rich even if the poor are willing to sacrifice to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.399" offset="7488972">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.832" offset="7502660">I must confess in all kind or that the first time that I read the pleadings in this case and the arguments of Mr. Shanks’ brief, I did not then understand how or if Florida was in fact discriminating against the school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.631" offset="7581863">I still do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.746" offset="7594402">The whole underlying concept of the minimum foundation funding formula in Florida is a recognition of the social economic fact that some of Florida’s counties are poor in relation to the student numbers and some are wealthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.370" offset="7656887">We go in and with the minimum foundation funding formula, a complex series of statutes, we recognized that some counties cannot fund for themselves and we are going to see that they can at least give their children a minimum acceptable education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.132" offset="7731911">Mr. Shanks has indicated this morning that he is focusing on a narrow or he’s making a narrow argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.849" offset="7766810">I don’t think that we can judge whether or not Florida is in fact discriminating against its school children without looking at the total concept of the minimum foundation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.493" offset="7829295">Mr. Shanks has indicated in his brief and in argument that several of Florida’s county, 16 I think suffered in excess of $50,000,000.00 loss because the minimum or because the Millage Rollback Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.141" offset="7887914">In truth and in fact, when they considered the infusion of state moneys to make up for those moneys that were lost, there is an increase in excess of $112,000,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.939" offset="7939114">So, the counties have not suffered as a result of the minimum or rather of the Millage Rollback Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.282" offset="7972551">I would urge the Court to determine whether or not we in Florida are discriminating against our school children in our poor counties, in fact and not in theory.</text>
