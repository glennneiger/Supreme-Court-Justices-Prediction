            <label>Ms. Louise H. Renne</label>
            <text syncTime="26.717" offset="210213">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.033" offset="223483">This case arises on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of California and presents the issue of the applicability of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to a state hit and run statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.260" offset="288371">In particular, we think the questions presented by this case are one, whether the requirement imposed by a state hit and run statute that a driver involved in an accident must stop at the scene and give his name and address violates the privilege against self-incrimination and two, whether it is necessary to bar use of that information or fruits of that information in any criminal proceeding, in order to sustain the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.669" offset="422013">The State Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did apply to the requirement that a driver must stop at the scene of the accident and identify himself and that the constitutionality of the statute could only be sustained if no use of that information or the fruits was made in any criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.477" offset="525249">It is our position that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to a requirement that a driver must stop and identify himself to the owner of damaged property or to a person injured on the road and that it is not necessary to bar identification evidence or the fruits to that compliance in any kind of criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.381" offset="612916">The way in which this case arose procedurally, was that a two-count criminal complaint was filed in the Mendocino County Justice Court for the Ukiah Judicial District in California, charging the respondent Jonathan Todd Byers with two misdemeanor violations of the California Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.166" offset="704031">Count 1 of the complaint charged that the respondent Byers failed to pass to the left safely as he was overtaking and passing a vehicle proceeding in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.849" offset="750738">Count 2 of the complaint charged that he violated the California property damage hit and run statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.759" offset="782399">Under that statute, a driver is required to stop at the scene of the accident when he is involved in any accident resulting in property damage and give his name and address to the owner or of the property damaged or the driver of the vehicle damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.559" offset="849586">This requirement is similar to the uniform vehicle code requirement and in fact the laws of all jurisdictions in our country impose similar requirements that driver must stop and identify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.022" offset="907473">The purpose of the statute is to protect against financial loss or where similar requirements are imposed in personal injury hit and run statute to ensure that people will not be left lying hurt and injured on the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="971316">There is another section, part of the statute 2, Section 202 and that deals in the case where you have unattended property where the driver or owner of the damaged property cannot be immediately located.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.037" offset="1031502">In that case, the driver must leave a note on the car giving that same information and statement of the circumstances and notify the local police.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.025" offset="1071522">The purpose of that provision is to make sure that when the owner of the damaged property comes to his property, he will know who to contact in the case when he sees the note or if the note has been lost or destroyed, find out who the owner was from the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.301" offset="1144560">This particular part of the statute has never been raised and questioned in the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.243" offset="1176325">Instead from the outset of the case when the demurrer was first filed to the complaint, the basis of the respondent's argument was that the minimal duty to stop and give the name and address to the driver or owner of the property damaged, violated the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.618" offset="1249886">The Justice Court dismissed the demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.536" offset="1261484">However, when a writ of prohibition was then taken to the superior court, the superior court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applied to this minimal duty and that the respondent Byers could not be prosecuted for failing to stop at the scene of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.580" offset="1337657">The people filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.595" offset="1353749">The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.103" offset="1371826">The Court of Appeal held that the -- it held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did apply to this identification requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.481" offset="1413308">But that the constitutionality of the statute could be sustained if no use were made of the identification evidence or any fruits of the compliance with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.243" offset="1456358">Both parties then filed petitions for hearing with the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.062" offset="1475584">The State Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.273" offset="1492511">It agreed with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it held that all drivers must stop and comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.287" offset="1524485">It also agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Fifth Amendment applied to the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.209" offset="1552175">But it further held that the constitutionality of the statute could be sustained if no use were made of that information in any kind of criminal proceeding that might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.355" offset="1600763">The court recognized that this was a new doctrine of jurisprudence because until the decision below, this kind of requirement had been uniformly upheld in California and other elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.914" offset="1663039">So that the court held that fairness required that the respondent Byer should be excused for his failure to stop at the scene of the accident because the respondent could not have anticipated that the court would impose this kind of use restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.340" offset="1736704">We respectfully submit that the decision of the State Supreme Court should be reversed and we have three primary reasons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="418.259" stopTime="431.427">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="418.259" offset="1776410">Do you understand that the use restriction would include any reliance by the state on the fact that this was the man who -- this was the name of the man who caused the damage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_h_renne" startTime="431.427" stopTime="611.256">
            <label>Ms. Louise H. Renne</label>
            <text syncTime="431.427" offset="1829073">Yes Your Honor, this is our understanding of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.002" offset="1851329">Now, we might say that the decision doesn't really say that we are estop from the moment the Fifth Amendment applies from the moment -- from mere observation that the man has stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.729" offset="1906291">What the State Supreme Court held was that the privilege applies at the moment, driver is required to stop and give his name and address at the scene of the accident and reasonably believes that compliance will result in self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.057" offset="1975568">If I might jump ahead of myself just to give a practical illustration of where I think the court's decision leads us and that case is illustrated by a case now pending in the Court of Appeal in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.878" offset="2038888">The particular facts of the case are that the petitioner who was in fact an unlicensed driver hit a parked car and stopped in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.530" offset="2077445">He stopped and apparently the owner of the parked car was in a restaurant or the nearby area and the owner came out and the petitioner gave his name and address to the owner of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.513" offset="2129377">Some minutes later while the petitioner was standing there talking with the owner of the damaged vehicle, the police arrived on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.385" offset="2164903">It may have been in response to a call, but for some reason the police arrived on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.200" offset="2188204">The petitioner immediately said to the police, my car hit this parked car and I have been drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.474" offset="2221223">The police noticed that the petitioner did appear to be a bit unsteady on his feet and he did smell of intoxicants and advised the petitioner of the imply conscience statute, under which petitioner driver is deemed to have given his consent to a Breathalyzer test.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.457" offset="2293217">And as a result of that test and the facts, a misdemeanor drunk driving complaint was filed in the California Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.593" offset="2333759">The petitioner argued one, that the state could not introduce evidence of his name and address which he had given to the other driver because that was barred by the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.791" offset="2378585">Number two, but for the statute he would not have stopped and then the police wouldn't have found out, wouldn't have arrived on the scene presumably and he wouldn't have told the police that he was drinking and the results of the Breathalyzer test would not have become known.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.343" offset="2452773">The Superior Court, although the municipal court refused to dismiss the complaint, the Superior Court held that under the decision below the information as to the name and address was privileged, the statements to the police were privileged and the results of the Breathalyzer test were privileged, even though under other cases of this Court, that information would not be privileged.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="611.256" offset="2548381">So it's your submission General Renne as I understand it that, the decision of the Supreme Court of California in this case means that if a driver damages property and stops along, leaves his name, he first of all of course is not guilty of violation of the hit and run statute and secondly he immunizes himself from any prosecution for any other offense, is that?</text>

            <text syncTime="640.884" offset="2666872">And I suppose a logical extension of that might be -- it could be argued that he also immunizes himself from any subsequent tort liability if it can be shown that it resulted from his identification as a result of his stopping and leaving his name?</text>

            <text syncTime="662.267" offset="2752449">Yes, that is correct Your Honor and I think how far you can carry this, you can just perhaps go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.397" offset="2780975">It not only applied -- first of all the lower California courts have extended the decision to the personal injury hit and run statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.018" offset="2819427">So that now, any time a driver is involved in an accident, he was assured virtual immunity from criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.331" offset="2876688">That is correct Your Honor and the purpose of the hit and run statute is not to catch criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.342" offset="2912737">The purpose of the statute is for very legitimate reasons either protecting against financial loss or to make sure that people are not left suffering on the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.793" offset="2954533">And if in the course complying with this statute, a criminal violation is revealed, we are precluded from doing anything about it and consequently it's our view that any deterrent effect of the criminal laws is completely lost, whereas as is frequently the case, the right to have a license or predicate -- or revocation of a license is the predicated on conviction, we are led into very serious problems in making sure that only careful and confident people are driving on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.991" offset="3115342">It's our position that this -- the decision is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.902" offset="3138957">It's wrong because the statute does not create a substantial hazard of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.987" offset="3167274">It's requirements, merely giving your name and address is akin to identification requirements, it's akin to requirements that have been imposed at any kind of regulatory field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.855" offset="8978787">Initially, I'd like to point out that there are three areas that I'm going to discuss, but I'm not going to take them up in the order in which I now present them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.265" offset="9020479">The first, is that there has been a incomplete statement of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.262" offset="9044407">Secondly, there has been an erroneous, completely erroneous characterization of California Law after the Byers decision and thirdly, the point of the implied waiver, we've heard discussed here today was raised for the first time in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.504" offset="9129357">Now, this has been argued before and was before both the California Supreme Court and the California Court of Appeal, but I did not have the opportunity to present my position on the doctrine of the implied waver before this Court, because it came before this Court the first time in the reply of brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.089" offset="9203754">But I will comment, I hope somewhat extensively on that theory in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.730" offset="9226324">The underlying facts involved in this case are really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.952" offset="9247222">They start off this, Byers was driving a vehicle down one of this roads, the public highways in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.131" offset="9283897">He was following a vehicle in front of him, and while attempting to pass the vehicle in front, he made what is known as an unlawful pass or unsafe pass to the left, a violation of California Vehicle Code Section in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.372" offset="9376893">As a result of that failure to make a pace -- a safe pass to the left, there was a collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.359" offset="9416808">The collision caused property damage and the property damage which was caused as result of that accident, is the property damage that triggered the Hit and Run Statute here in question, California Vehicle Code, Section 2002 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.286" offset="9484518">Now, at the trial, in the prohibition proceedings there was indeed a stipulation to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.062" offset="9519626">There was also a finding, in the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law, in connection with the prohibition proceeding, indicating that indeed was the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.904" offset="9566960">And so that what we have here is the issue as to whether or not the State of California can by the use of the Hit and Run Statute force a man to make a statement which would incriminate himself for indeed, it was criminal action on the part of Byers which triggered the reporting requirement of the Hit and Run statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.887" offset="10074885">That’s correct and I am going to get back to that point in a minute is the reason that I feel that, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.972" offset="10115218">Every California Court from the Superior Court to the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of California has held that there has been a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.583" offset="10165687">Under the facts of this case, the only argument is that the Superior Court said, I am reading Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board for as you recognize Marchetti, Grosso, Haynes and Leary had not been decided at the time of the prohibition proceedings in the California Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.371" offset="10248861">At that point, the Court said that the Fifth Amendment privilege was a complete defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.805" offset="10270595">There was an appeal, the appeal went to the Court of Appeal of California, the only difference really between the decision of the Superior Court and decision of the California Court of Appeal was that the California Court of Appeal seized upon the concept of use restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.294" offset="10352515">Now the concept of use restrictions was not even argued before the California Court of Appeal in any kind of meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.628" offset="10385847">It wasn’t raised in the briefs and it was only collaterally touched upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.967" offset="10415208">The decision came down, using rather vague terms, the reference to the Court of Appeal citation is found in the petition for writ of certiorari, the exact citations skips of my mind at the moment, but if the Court is to look at that decision, you see that the use restriction concept really did at that point, give someone a fear of the so called immunity bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.264" offset="10524400">For that reason both counsel for the petitioner and the counsel for the respondent, petitioned the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.267" offset="10560449">There was a dual reason behind the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.677" offset="10582079">It was sought to be urged a concept of fairness, but if this was indeed a new concept of -- in the jurisprudence of the State of California, namely the creation of use restrictions then he should not be criminally punished for having agreed with all of the members of the California courts that the Fifth Amendment was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.058" offset="10667656">The Court granted the petition for hearing and in fact it granted both petitions for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.438" offset="10693151">There is quoted in the reply brief what appears to be a concession on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.840" offset="10722722">I want to place that concession in proper context for I do not concede now that it is a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.049" offset="10755532">If the Court compares the language of the Court of Appeal decision you will see why I made the statements in the petition for a hearing before the California Supreme Court as broadly as I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.925" offset="10815091">But the issue of the use restrictions of course was one of the main issues before the California Supreme Court and it was fully argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.615" offset="10849782">The California Supreme Court’s decision in the case is substantially different than the use restriction concept used by the Court of Appeal below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.774" offset="10902444">At this point, the California Supreme Court created a limited concept of use restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.013" offset="10939434">The Court clearly states in that case that it is only the information which is procured as a result of the compliance with the hit and run statute which is -- which cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.919" offset="11015084">There is no concept of an immunity bath used by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.319" offset="11040684">The language is in three or four different places in the opinion clearly indicating that the only thing that is within the use restriction is this concept of the information actually compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.964" offset="11103274">Now, there are two California Court of Appeal cases subsequent to Byers which clearly shows that Byers has not produced that immunity bath in California that the Attorney General would have you believe, simply is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.103" offset="11179760">The first citation is found in both, it was first found in my brief, the respondent's brief and later it appears on the reply brief, it's Bailey versus Superior Court of Ventura and its 4 Cal. App. 3d 522.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.116" offset="11287803">That is a case that came up after the decision in Byers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.444" offset="11305148">It was a case dealing with Section 2001, rather than 2002 of the California Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.708" offset="11338167">The difference being 2001 is that Personal Injury Hit and Run Statute, 2002 is the Property Damage Hit and Run Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.481" offset="11385292">Well, I think there is a difference and the reason I have pointed out that in the brief was not that there is a difference in the reporting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.887" offset="11422908">For both the statutes require you to stop and to characterize yourself, if you will, as being the driver of the adverse vehicle and in that sense they are both self-incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.385" offset="11472959">For under the facts of this case for example, if Byers had indeed stopped and had characterized himself as the driver of the vehicle who had sideswiped the other automobile, he would have been supplying the prosecution with one of the elements of the offense, plainly and simply --</text>

            <text syncTime="3886.256" offset="15648371">It's a legal fiction and the effect of the legal fiction is to create a substantive rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.891" offset="15678986">When you say someone is impliedly waived to something that is really in effect a substantive rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.358" offset="15708766">The substantive rule and law in California, is for the California courts or the California legislature to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.646" offset="15737919">It only would become a federal question if and only if the courts first decided that there was in fact such an implied waiver, then the constitutional issue would attach, as to whether or not in fact this was constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.662" offset="15801971">But under this case, all of the courts, the Court of Appeal expressly refused to find implied waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.674" offset="15826108">There is no basis for it in either a California statute or a California case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.122" offset="15847842">Secondly, the California Supreme Court said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.791" offset="15866546">They called it “unattainable” and again, the Court of Appeal in the Bailey case has held the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.081" offset="15903744">So I don't think that the idea of implied waiver presents this Court with any federal question in this case.</text>
