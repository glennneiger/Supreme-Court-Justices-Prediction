            <text syncTime="21.046" offset="84114">Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.076" offset="112222">This case and the two with it follow: present the question of the extent of retroactive application of the decision in Chimel versus California, decided in the 1968 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.763" offset="171050">Chimel dealt with the permissible scope of a search without a warrant, but pursuant to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.582" offset="206263">The Fourth Amendment has long been understood to permit a search without warrant as an incident to a valid arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.802" offset="235207">The question in Chimel was how far can a search go and still be deemed an incident to a valid arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.404" offset="269584">In that case, the court held that to be incident to an arrest, a search must be confined to the person arrested or the immediate vicinity from which he might reach weapons or destructible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.176" offset="328620">Any search beyond the immediate person or the immediate vicinity without a validly issued search warrant would violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.467" offset="413780">I think that there is other doctrine not necessary emanating from Chimel that holds that if the officer is legally on the premises, he may seize any contraband or other fruits of crime that are visible to him.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="120.806" offset="483161">Pistol or an apple?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_miller" startTime="123.046" stopTime="346.646">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="123.046" offset="492147">I think a pistol, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.537" offset="506044">Now in Chimel, the rule of that case was applied to invalidate a search of an entire house in which the defendant was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.557" offset="538227">In the present case, the convict, the petitioner was convicted on the basis of evidence seized at the time of his arrest when the rushing officers have no warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.248" offset="584934">He was arrested in his apartment, and after entry into the apartment and arrest of petitioner, the arresting officers proceeded to search throughout the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.196" offset="624744">And in the course of their search, they uncovered the hidden in the closets and kitchen a certain evidence that was material to petitioner’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.129" offset="664451">Now concededly, the search without warrant in this case went far beyond the petitioner’s person or the immediate vicinity of his arrest, and the Government makes no claim now to makes no claim in this case that the search was incident to the arrest within the meaning of that term as defined in Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.239" offset="752953">The Government does urge however that the search here ought not be deemed a violation of the standard announced in Chimel because there were exigent circumstances that justified a broader search without warrant, then when otherwise be permitted under the Chimel doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.121" offset="828395">We treat this point in our reply brief and I -- it warns just a few words this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.073" offset="856189">The exigent circumstances alleged here by the Government where that the petitioner’s wife was present in the apartment at the time of his arrest, and that she might disposed of incriminating evidence if a search and seizure where not immediately undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.973" offset="927869">This explanation for the warrantless search is virtually identical to the justification for a similar warrantless search of a dwelling in last year’s case of Vale against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.969" offset="995788">The argument was rejected in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.273" offset="1009058">There the court held that the requirement for a warrant for a search of a dwelling was subject only to a few well recognized exceptions, and that the asserted justification advanced there which is identical to the one advanced here did not fall within one of those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.074" offset="1096202">Now, the Government contends that the present case is different because the officers here were concerned that petitioner might be forewarned of his an imminent arrest and flee, and that this justified the officers in making the arrest and the search without first securing the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.135" offset="1172480">Now, the basis of this claim is that an alleged middleman in the narcotics dealings in which petitioner is accused was in custody and the he knew, he the middleman, knew that the officials were seeking his supplier, and that he might therefore forewarn his supplier by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.208" offset="1256803">We think this claim to be insufficient on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.873" offset="1271432">The alleged middleman here had been in custody for two days prior to the arrest of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.734" offset="1298913">Had he been disposed and able to forewarn his supplier, he would have done so for long before petitioner was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.385" offset="1333499">Moreover, it does not seem likely to us that the middleman’s captors would have allowed him unrestricted access to a telephone for the purpose of forewarning accomplices of impending arrest.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="346.646" offset="1386580">What about the Government’s point that his common-law wife could very well destroy it after he was arrested?</text>

            <text syncTime="353.357" offset="1413329">Well Your Honor, that’s the point that was -- that is precisely the point made in Vale by the arresting officers in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.648" offset="1438511">And the court said that’s an insufficient ground for not securing a warrant before making the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.265" offset="1469022">And that’s exactly the point we make here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="372.528" offset="1490024">No, Your Honor, this is here on collateral attack -- this is collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.938" offset="1503713">This conviction became final and cert was denied I think in 1967, 1964 excuse me, I’ll correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.991" offset="1543941">In short, on this aspect of the case which I’ll leave, the Government -- we don’t believe has shown that the arresting officers in this case were justified in searching petitioner’s apartment without first securing the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.245" offset="1592947">We think at beyond serious dispute that the search and seizure in this case cannot pass master under the standards for searches incident to arrest that were announced in the Chimel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.600" offset="1642371">And so we come to the question of whether Chimel should be applied retroactively in this case which is I said Mr. Justice Harlan arises on collateral review of petitioner’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.239" offset="1696914">We begin with the basic rule of Weeks against United States and its progeny that a physical search of the person or his dwelling must be pursuant to a valid search warrant issued by a magistrate upon a showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.391" offset="1765564">Now, there are exceptions to this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.000" offset="1771938">One of which is that a search warrant may be conducted as -- a search may be conducted as an incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.280" offset="1809032">This Court typically decides several cases each year that explicate the basic Week’s rule or its generally recognized exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.275" offset="1853022">No one would reasonably suggest that each of these decisions and each term of this Court be given only prospective effect, and we know of no such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.425" offset="1893669">Indeed, the Government here concedes that this result of automatic prospectivity might result in an intolerable burden of sorting out the effective date of each new ones of the basic rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.473" offset="1961796">Even more intolerable, we submit would be a regime whereby this Court considered separately, and each of these many Fourth Amendment cases whether to apply the case retroactively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.697" offset="2014772">And yet, we recognized that the court in recent years has limited application of some of its criminal procedure decisions, including some decisions arising under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provisions, and the question as we see it is therefore in what kind of case, in what class of case should the court make a determination as to whether to apply a criminal procedure decision retroactively or prospectively?</text>

            <text syncTime="570.930" offset="2283624">It’s also help to sort out to some of the cases and the argument that now with I am going to make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.779" offset="2319047">I do think that Linkletter versus Walker which is the root case in this area does not answer the question that is now before this Court in this case which is when do you make the determination of retroactivity?</text>
            <text syncTime="592.501" offset="2369933">Linkletter versus Walker sets out standards for deciding the question when the question is presented to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.467" offset="2397832">It doesn’t reveal when that question is appropriately raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.547" offset="2414132">However, we think that upon reviewing some of the retroactivity decisions including those set forth in the appendix Mr. Justice Stewart that there emerges from those cases, an appropriate test as to when the question of retroactivity ought to be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.951" offset="2491768">There are seven instances in which constitutional decisions have not been given fully retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.485" offset="2525936">Each of these decisions involved the extension of a constitutional provision to a wholly new area of activity where it had not been thought previously to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.719" offset="2578808">For example in the Katz case which was given retroactive, I mean prospective only effect in Desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.980" offset="2611827">The protection of the Fourth Amendment was extended for the first time to electronic eavesdropping or nontrespassory invasions of property -- of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.909" offset="2659579">Now in Miranda and Escobedo whose backward reach was limited at Johnson versus New Jersey the right to counsel and police interrogations before as well as after indictment was established for the first time, and in the way Gilbert case which was given prospective only effect in Stovall the right to counsel and lineups was announced for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.247" offset="2756963">Similarly, Mapp against Ohio given limited retroactive effect in Linkletter was extension of the exclusionary rule to the states for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.279" offset="2801058">The jury cases, the Bloom against Illinois and Duncan against Louisiana which were given prospective only effect in DeStefano, those cases extended the right to trial by jury in all state cases for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.455" offset="2861767">Finally, the Griffin case which was given prospective only the effect in Tehan extended the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination provision to comments by the judge for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.816" offset="2919236">All of these cases involved in the extension of a constitutional provision to a new area of activity where it have not previously been thought to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.162" offset="2960614">However, the Chimel decision which is before us today is of a very different nature from those cases that I’ve just canvassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.484" offset="2997917">Chimel does not extend the Fourth Amendment to an area of activity where it had not been thought previously to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.113" offset="3032398">From the beginning it has been clear that physical searches must meet Fourth Amendment standards, even where deemed incident to a valid arrest so that the warrant is not mandated, a physical search is still within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.277" offset="3105019">Chimel like many other cases simply added refinement to the principle of law that searches incident to a valid arrest may be conducted without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.436" offset="3153711">Chimel dealt with the dividing line between searches incident to arrest and which need not be accompanied by warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.916" offset="3183595">And those that meet the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard because -- I think I said it wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.986" offset="3211912">Chimel in affect dealt with the dividing line between searches for which a warrant is required, and those for which a warrant is not required but which otherwise meet the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.151" offset="3264575">As a result of Chimel a dividing line was moved somewhat, and so the incident to arrest doctrine has been constrictive.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.529" offset="3598106">It still had to meet the reasonableness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.438" offset="3609704">No one is ever suggested that a physical search was wholly unrelated to the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.279" offset="3697058">They also happen to deal with the incident to arrest doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.934" offset="3715657">In the Preston case in 376 U.S., the court ruled that a search of a car is police custody after the driver had been removed and placed in jail was too remote to be considered incident to a lawful arrest, and consequently, a warrant was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.396" offset="3789531">But last term in Chambers against Maroney, the court held in almost identical factual circumstances that the car search there was incident to arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.011" offset="3927980">It is a -- distinguishing cases is one way of limiting their application, as just as overruling a past precedent in other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.033" offset="3968104">But another illustration of the point I now make is the Warden against Hayden in 387 U.S., and I think, this is perhaps even more appropriate example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.852" offset="4007393">Here is a case where the prevailing doctrine that seizure of mere evidence of crime was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.000" offset="4043964">There had been a doctrine that police could search and seize instrumentalities and fruits of crime, but not “mere evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.890" offset="4087536">Well, this Court rejected that distinction in the Warden against Hayden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.364" offset="4101433">Yet I know of no suggestion that Warden against Hayden should be applied only prospectively with the earlier mere evidence rule left on the books to apply the cases that annotated Warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.146" offset="4148558">Now, these examples and others I think illustrate ebb and flow in the -- that is characteristic of decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment, and Chimel is like those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.309" offset="4193176">It can’t be distinguished from them and unless there are to be limits on the applicability of every Fourth Amendment decision, an approach that I think would admittedly wreak havoc with the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.763" offset="4246988">There can be no reason to basis for limiting the application of Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.518" offset="4269976">It maybe suggested that Chimel is different because it expressly overruled to prior precedent, the Rabinowitz and Harris cases, and this I think comes to the point that Mr. Justice White was touching on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.605" offset="4322325">I respectfully suggest that this would not be a meaningful distinction of the Chimel decision from the other myriad of Fourth Amendment decisions announced every year by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.107" offset="4372376">Many of the court’s decision have the effect of dissipating earlier precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.578" offset="4390243">Sometimes, it’s done by an express overruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.572" offset="4402260">Sometimes by distinguishing a case out of existence or distinguishing it in a way that narrowly limits its ambit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.463" offset="4433816">Sometimes cases are discarded without mention at all, and Chambers is a good example because there, the Court did not purport to overrule Preston, but conceded -- but it cannot be denied that the Chambers decision narrows the reach of Preston; there can’t be too much left to Preston after Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.322" offset="4513228">Indeed, the Vale decision of last term which I mentioned earlier provides a sort of different illustration to this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.660" offset="4882599">Yet, it would be quite anomalous to hold that Chimel which involve a search without a warrant after arrest just inside the door is not to be given retroactive effect, if Vale which involve a search without warrant after arrest just outside the door is to be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.250" offset="4976953">The point is that there is nothing unique about the expressed overruling of a prior precedent that would warrant limiting the effect of a particular new decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.551" offset="5106103">Now, the Government in this brief has asserted a different test for determining when to consider, limiting the application of new procedural due process rulings and the Government’s test is whether the new decision is a landmark decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.370" offset="5249463">It cannot be said for example that chambers which altered the prevailing law on the appropriateness of the search of a car incident to an arrest is more or less a landmark decision then Chimel which altered the prevailing law on the appropriateness of the search of a house as an incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.773" offset="5335040">The rubric landmark does not answer the question at issue which is to what class of cases should the Court consider given prospective on the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.163" offset="5376627">We submit the only objective distinction that can be drawn that has an effect been drawn in the cases today is between rulings extending the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional decision to new areas of activity where they were previously not applied on one hand and on the other hand, rulings that merely explicate the meaning of a constitutional provision without extending it to a new area of activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.050" offset="7384189">Well, all in the case set in two ways if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.372" offset="7393384">First, I think we -- there may be some tendency to exalt this notion of official reliance on the decision of this Court and especially it is true in an area like the incident to arrest area which is typified by decisions like Rabinowitz which say that each case return on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.658" offset="7482619">And that the circumstances must govern in every case and we can make no real hard and fast rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.501" offset="7501949">We’ve quoted the language from Rabinowitz in our brief which seems to me to suggests that the -- we can carry at least perhaps to some reasonable extremes the notion that officers were relying on Supreme Court decisions every time they take an action in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.281" offset="7565061">But beyond that, it seems to me that the notion, the question that you’ve just raised is typical of the questions that are asked when one is applying the Linkletter versus Walker standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.381" offset="7633502">That’s one the questions that is discussed in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.389" offset="7645518">We suggest that Linkletter versus Walker standards, a Linkletter versus Walker analysis need not and ought not be made in every criminal decisions of this Court because of the destructive effects that it would have -- that would ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.861" offset="7703406">And so what I'm suggesting is that the Linkletter versus Walker type of analysis ought to be limited to a certain class of cases and I've tried this morning to set out the class of cases which I think it is here before been limited and which ought to be limited in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.875" offset="7815419">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.557" offset="7826181">Without anticipating here the argument in the next case which I also be doing for the Government, the Williams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.726" offset="7850841">It may be helpful to take a minute at the outset to outline the issues that are in this pair related cases in the Government’s position and presentation in each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.729" offset="7894831">The present case the Elkanich case can we think the affirmed on either of two Browns and I think Mr. Miller has acknowledged that at least to the formal letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.342" offset="7929313">First of the search which happen long before Chimel was valid under Pre-Chimel Standards and Chimel should not be applied retroactively here on plenary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.265" offset="7969019">And second, that even a part from that even assuming that Chimel did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.891" offset="7995559">The search in this case would be consistent with the principles of Chimel in view of the conglomeration of special circumstances that I will discuss in a couple of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.593" offset="8054282">In the next case, the Williams case, we similarly argue that the search was valid under the Pre-Chimel standards enforced when the cert was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.545" offset="8090122">The Williams contest that proposition as I think its fair to say, Elkanich does not but we do not argue that the William search would be valid that if it had taken place after Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.200" offset="8140800">Accordingly, we urge the Court to affirm the Williams judgment on the sole ground of nonretroactivity of Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.634" offset="8174446">Now on this retroactivity issue that’s common to the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.837" offset="8187298">They differ in that as I’ve indicated Chimel -- Elkanich comes here on collateral review whereas Williams is here on direct review of the conviction and was in fact pending in the Court of Appeals when Chimel was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.763" offset="8246962">For reasons that I would go into my argument in the next case, we think that makes no difference since the crucial dividing point for retroactivity purposes should be the date of the search as the Court held in Desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.246" offset="8300983">My argument on retroactivity in the present case will be a simpler one presents in order to prevail on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.248" offset="8340898">I think Elkanich would have to convince the Court that Chimel should be fully retroactive without regard to the more delicate questions of dividing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.022" offset="8388023">But before I go into the retroactivity question in this case, I would like to turn first to our proposition that the search of Elkanich’s apartment was under all the circumstances, one that would be valid even if it were carried on today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.685" offset="8438700">This is a very important proposition for the Government and we asserted here just as strenuously as we do the nonretroactivity point even though it may not be necessary to reach it depending on how the Court decides the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.786" offset="8499096">On the search question, we start with the premise which is not contested that this was a search made pursuant to a valid arrest without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.014" offset="8540056">In fact, the validity of the arrest was the question that was litigated on direct review in 1963, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.879" offset="8571507">The Court of Appeals held that there was ample probable cause to arrest Elkanich in his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.929" offset="8595644">This Court denies certiorari and as I indicated, I think there's no issue as to the validity of arrest here on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.230" offset="8632842">We acknowledge however, that the search of the apartment of Elkanich’s apartment was more extensive than what Chimel indicated, would routinely be appropriate as an instant to an arrest without a search warrant in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.667" offset="8682580">It is not simply a search without commit himself and the area within his immediate control where he could obtain weapons or destructible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.223" offset="8716852">We acknowledge this was a search by several narcotics agent and at least two of the three rooms of Elkanich’s small apartment and then it went on for some time as --</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.880" offset="8767425">I -- it’s that’s a little unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.541" offset="8782158">The agents were there roughly an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.375" offset="8793443">The record suggests that they spent a good deal at time, trying to persuade the Elkanich to cooperate with them and reveal his sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.774" offset="8823014">So, it’s hard to re-establish exactly how many agents spent how long searching through things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.646" offset="8858540">We do admit though that it was a search of some scope and time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.065" offset="8892186">The products of the search which were introduced in evidence were merely two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.813" offset="8919249">Marked currency which was found in the kitchen closet and a plastic bag which was found in the living room closet; and which was similar to the plastic bag that have been used in some of the sales of narcotics, sales of heroin that were involved in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.007" offset="9023948">But as I indicate, we believe that the combination of special circumstances here did make the search reasonable without -- and that the search therefore should not be judge solely by the standards established in Chimel as to routine searches pursuant to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.784" offset="9115063">This was not routine search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.660" offset="9134602">We think that there were really three exceptional factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.627" offset="9150485">First, we think the record shows that there was probable cause for the relatively narrowly focus search in terms of what the agents apparently were looking for and what they found would actually occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.871" offset="9211402">Second, there was a real danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.580" offset="9218299">We think the record shows that agents did not search the apartment when they did when they went there to arrest Elkanich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.948" offset="9243690">The evidence they reasonably expected to find in the apartment would be removed or destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.761" offset="9275037">And third and I think most important in distinguishing this case from some of the others that have been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.622" offset="9302413">The circumstances leading up to the arrest had brought the agents to the apartment with such genuine urgency that it was not reasonably practicable for them to obtain a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.555" offset="9346194">Even though we think they could have if they had have time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.603" offset="9638348">Of course as I indicate, we are not rearguing Chimel here even though, that the dissenters in that case believe that the first two of the factors probable cause and danger of loss of evidence were present there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.211" offset="9692787">Again, I think this case is different from that because of this third factor and in fact the Chimel rule that the statement of the rule in the majority opinion does not really focus on the two factors of probable cause and danger of loss of evidence that the dissenters pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.353" offset="9777319">So, I think Chimel has to be read as stating the rule for a routine search pursuant to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.048" offset="9824131">This brings me then to the circumstances that we think made it impracticable to obtain a warrant and this will require me to state the facts of the case and considerable more detail than the petitioner did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.130" offset="9884421">This case involved three sales of heroin by a man named Rios to an undercover agent totaling about 60 grams and these three sales were over the period of a week in the summer of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.103" offset="9952340">One, the first sale was July 13th and then there were two more on July 18th and 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.581" offset="9974282">Each time the intermediary Rios was given marked currency by the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.144" offset="10008555">He went away and came back with the heroin which suggested of course that he was obtaining it from then unknown third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.900" offset="10043559">Rios was arrested on the afternoon very shortly after the last of these sales on July 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.932" offset="10075638">On his person, he had two keys and an address book.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.292" offset="10093087">When questioned that afternoon about his source of supply, he would say only that it was a Chinese seaman name Charlie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.577" offset="10126211">It was no -- unable to get anymore information than this from Rios, the undercover agent Mr. Lang, testified that he spent the evening of July 19th testing the keys he had found in an apartment house where apparently he had some reason to suspect the keys might belong that was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.384" offset="10213460">The case began to break on the afternoon of July 20th, the next day, when Rios became a bit more talkative maintaining his story about the Chinese seaman named Charlie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.671" offset="10266645">But admitting with the keys where to Room 30 of a place called the Marlow Hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.995" offset="10295902">This in fact was a place where Lang had seen Rios go from across the street apparently to obtain the heroin that he bought from him at the first sale on July 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.358" offset="10345430">So, that Marlow Hotel rang a bell in Lang’s mind base on his own observation of that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.034" offset="10384091">Almost immediately Lang still the same afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.272" offset="10397048">In fact, all of the events of this case through the search take place over a period of, perhaps, three or four hours between sometime in the afternoon which had been flared from the record and about 6 p.m. when the search took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.590" offset="10454309">Lang as I say went promptly to the hotel to check what Rios had told them about the keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.939" offset="10487745">He found out from the manager of the hotel that on July 13th which was the night when presumably Room 30 had been used in connection with this sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.144" offset="10528496">Room 30 had been rented not to any Chinese but to a person who’d signed his name as Joseph Elkanich, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.478" offset="10561829">The manager describer him considerable detail and said that the she’d been little suspicious because the evidence that had indicated the next morning when he hadn’t slept in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.770" offset="10607073">Lang then went right back to the narcotics headquarters which I presume I gather all of these locations are in fairly close proximity to each other since the rent seem to move quite quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.028" offset="10652108">There he looked up the files on Elkanich found that he had been involved in smuggling of heroin from orient in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.109" offset="10688366">He had some other matters to attend to in Court that afternoon but as soon as he could, he obtained pictures of Elkanich from the San Francisco police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.790" offset="10727131">We discover he’d had him had arrested him and it served some time on a local robbery I believe conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.277" offset="10761091">But he take pictures from them then he went back to the hotel and verified with the hotel clerk that these pictures look like the man who had rented Room 30 on July 13th, the night of the first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.279" offset="10821068">I think it’s fair to say that at this point and probably at this point for the first time probable cause to go after Elkanich had emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.182" offset="10856699">Elkanich was tied quite clearly to the place where apparently the narcotics had been obtained from and it was, perhaps at least reasonable to suspect that Elkanich had also been the source for the two other sales within the very short period of a few days that Rios had made to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.200" offset="10952725">Having suddenly discovered that Elkanich seem to be the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.884" offset="10967458">It was a matter of considerable urgency to the police to the narcotics agents to go after him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.363" offset="10997447">Rios had obviously made efforts to conceal his source of supply and he had the police discovered then had access as Mr. Miller mention to a telephone at the county jail where he was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.539" offset="11062126">I don’t suppose that the urgency depends on what he might have done after that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.858" offset="11079367">He might already -- he might well already have tipped Elkanich off and Elkanich might be packing to leave town or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.903" offset="11107579">So, it seemed to them that it was quite urgent to pursue Elkanich as properly as they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.228" offset="11132865">And in addition, assuming that there had been substantial dealings between Elkanich and Rios, Elkanich might without regard any telephone call had suddenly discovered that his intermediary was missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.625" offset="11194410">So, that in any event the police, the agent felt and I think in good faith and was substantial justification that they should find this man as soon as they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.798" offset="11243102">In fact, they proceeded very promptly to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.342" offset="11253342">They check with the telephone company by subpoena and discovered that he had an armless to telephone having listed an apartment at the address, in fact, the apartment where he was where they went to find him and arrested him and searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.503" offset="11317917">In addition, they found in the notebook which Rios should have on its person when he was arrested, a notation of the telephone number from a man referred to as Joe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.619" offset="11614459">At this time at 5:45 in the afternoon, Agent Lang who was handling the matter principally did try to reach the United States Commissioner; he was unable to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.728" offset="13130815">So, then to the circumstances, I think the search considering the rights of both of parties was considerable less of intrusion than an attempt to freeze the situation pending efforts to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.556" offset="13194136">I might also just review the circumstances that we think made for the additional factor that there was probable cause to search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.048" offset="13912189">Yes, well without as I indicate the very serious intrusions upon the other occupant of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.556" offset="13954194">I think of a further factor in addition to the three, the exigency, the probable cause and the danger of losing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.101" offset="13988362">I think it is pertinent to bear in mind that this is a search at the time of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.224" offset="14008842">The fact that there is an arrest, does mean that the defendant will quite shortly be brought before magistrate and quite shortly have a lawyer appointed to protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.642" offset="14058475">So, its -- I think the context in which this occurs is somewhat different from the context, where their might not be with few minute safeguards that arise out of the arrest situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.247" offset="14116885">I would suggest that there is some analogy though I don’t want to press it too far between the decision last term in Chambers against Maroney, where in connection with the vehicle search, the two factors of probable cause and the danger of loss to the evidence were regarded as enough without either an arrest or perhaps at least so clearly the notion of impracticability of getting a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.685" offset="14254707">I would like to move on to the retroactivity questions that have been raised by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.063" offset="14296189">As I indicated what I said so far has assumed what we argue not to be the case but the Chimel governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.031" offset="14332029">I emphasized again that this case Elkanich is a collateral review case since the search took place in 1962 and the conviction became final in 1964 so that in order to prevail the petitioner would have to convince the Court of the Chimel Rule should be fully retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.739" offset="14418860">Its principle point of course is that, I guess he argues that we don’t have a retroactivity case here because Chimel was not the kind of change in the interpretation of the Constitution which invokes a retroactivity problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.162" offset="14496601">But I think its simplicity at least in what Mr. Miller said that he believes that if we do have a retroactivity problem here the principles of Desist and in fact all of the Court’s cases since Linkletter in 1965 indicate that this case should not be governed by Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.751" offset="14602971">I think, the first place to look in determining whether Chimel is a kind of change in the law that creates a retroactivity problem is the Chimel opinion itself, where the Court discuss the prior law at some length, and said clearly that the Rabinowitz case and I'm quoting now, “has come to stand for the proposition that a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest may generally extend the area that is considered to be in the possession or under the control of the person arrested.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.865" offset="14743406">And added another point the Court says, the rationale that allowed the searches and seizures in Rabinowitz and Harris would allow the searches and seizures in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.699" offset="14790740">Chimel involved the search of an entire three-bedroom house by three officers that went on for a good part of an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.807" offset="14823131">Rabinowitz involved a meticulous search of all of the drawers and cabinets of an office that went for an hour and a half and Harris was a five-hour search of a four-room apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.855" offset="14883318">All of these searches were I think considerably more elaborate than the search in this case and so, I think the -- it was contemporary standards in effect at the time of the search as express explicitly by this Court in its decisions continued to be good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.182" offset="14972656">Petitioner suggest that any policeman worthy of the name, to use this phrase, should have noticed some years before Chimel that this Court had lost enthusiasm for the Rabinowitz rule and therefore should have seized relying on it as a guide for their investigatory work, I think that’s unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.682" offset="15058651">In 1962 as a matter of fact, though as petitioner suggests without enthusiasm, this Court relied on the Rabinowitz case and the Abel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.467" offset="15101806">Considering that we are dealing here with the rules of primary behavior by police officers who I think have to be able to carry on their work with some degree of certainty and simplicity as to rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.122" offset="15160424">I think that it’s simply unrealistic to say that the police were not entitled to rely upon Rabinowitz rule in 1962 or for that matter in 1964 when the conviction began final here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.495" offset="15209953">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
