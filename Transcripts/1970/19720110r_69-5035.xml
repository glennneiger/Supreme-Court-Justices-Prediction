            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="19.885" offset="163083">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.298" offset="176666">This is case is on appeal of the Louisiana Supreme Court’s decision which affirmed appellant’s conviction and sentence for the crime of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.600" offset="209894">The two important issues considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court before this Court on review are first whether the seizure of appellant from a warrantless night time entry into his home violated the Fourth Amendment’s provision against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.867" offset="287008">And secondly, whether the Louisiana Jury System which extends the rule of unanimity to some defendants, but denied it to appellant amounts to a denial of equal protection and also whether a non-unanimous verdict is constitutionally permissible in light of the due process requirement that guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.935" offset="371226">The relevant facts, most important facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.934" offset="391288">Before daybreak, appellant, a young black citizen was seized from his bed by six New Orleans detectives, all who were armed with shotguns who had entered Johnson’s home without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.266" offset="444578">After a complete search of the home and additional interrogation, Frank Johnson was booked for crime of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.540" offset="473626">Three days later was part of a general lineup, that is a number of armed robbery suspects were put in a lineup and viewed by a number of armed robbery victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.116" offset="515945">A person who had been robbed, four weeks prior to appellant’s arrest identified Frank Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.185" offset="540291">This person, however, was not the one for which the appellant had been arrested and booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.324" offset="568817">The lineup identification was subsequently used at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.687" offset="582296">Pretrial hearings were held, where the appellant challenged his arrest and his detention during the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.201" offset="608314">Appellant was tried with the crime of armed robbery which since 1966 in Louisiana is a crime punishable from 5 to 99 years without the benefit of pardon or parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.552" offset="669754">The primary evidence against the appellant at trial was the eye witness identification of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.121" offset="692010">The jury verdict is 9 for guilty and three for not guilty which in Louisiana constitutes a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.417" offset="721163">Appellant was subsequently sentenced to 35 years at hard labor in Angola, Louisiana, where he has served four of those 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.921" offset="771213">In their brief, Louisiana states its policy of never obtaining warrants in cases of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.417" offset="801202">This policy is in direct conflict with this Court's consistent position that police must whenever possible obtain judicial approval of searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.987" offset="851462">Applying either the warrant test or even the visible search test, the facts of this case requires the finding of an unreasonable search and an unlawful seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.524" offset="905587">At the pretrial hearings, the police testified that there was no reason why they did not secure a warrant nor did the state show any emergency such as hot pursuit to justify the warrantless night time intrusion into appellant’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.971" offset="991373">In convenience to the police, the only reason behind Louisiana’s policy of not securing warrants was firmly rejected by this Court in Johnson versus Louisiana, and has been adhered to since.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.754" offset="1058560">It is precisely this type of case which shows the necessity to require the police to adhere to the Fourth Amendment, the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.557" offset="1101715">Based upon information that the police possessed at the time of the arrest, it is doubtful whether an arrest warrant could have been secured because police in this instance did not know the date or the place of the alleged defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.083" offset="1163886">On the basis of this questionable information, the police made their own determination of probable cause, they made their own determination that they did not need a warrant and further that they -- then you are at home at night, even in light of the Louisiana requirement that a special warrant was needed for night time searches.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.817" offset="1242776">Oh! Mr. Buckley, assuming there was a probable cause, is there some case in this Court that holds that there is a constitutional requirement for a warrant in connection with an arrest as distinguished from the search?</text>

            <text syncTime="311.018" offset="1327622">There is no case directly I can find Mr. Justice White, however, underlying in the thrust of all the cases which have alluded to the exceptions to the warrant requirement by implication this Court is indicating that a warrant is required prior to entering a home.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.279" offset="1444650">Once the police officers went there and made the entry, they are conducting a search, it is no longer --</text>

            <text syncTime="345.984" offset="1467429">But would you even -- you would not be making the same argument if he had been arrested on the street, assuming probable cause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_buckley" startTime="352.238" stopTime="357.783">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="352.238" offset="1492506">Then we would examine the probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.825" offset="1502851">There are instances Your Honor, probable cause is necessary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="357.783" stopTime="358.336">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="357.783" offset="1514658">Oh! Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_buckley" startTime="358.336" stopTime="427.255">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="358.336" offset="1516853">Either to make an arrest or conduct a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.519" offset="1529600">There is an additional requirement when one enters the home and that is a warrant unless there is an emergency which is the exception to the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.220" offset="1584353">And in this case also, the police officers testified that they planned not only to seize appellant in his home, but to have search the entire home for evidence and in fact they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.732" offset="1638479">These certainly are not reasons to avoid obtaining warrant, but as been said in this Court before McDonald versus United States, they are clearly compelling reasons why the police seek a magistrate and attempt to convince him whether a warrant is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.899" offset="1707128">Some additional factors peculiar to this case which shows the danger of at least a probable cause is that the appellant was never tried for the alleged offense which was formed the alleged basis of the police probable cause and the probable cause for the arrest of appellant was not reviewed by any Court until weeks after his arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.110" offset="1903987">It was that lineup and a victim made his identification, the evidence used from that lineup was the major evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.550" offset="1933662">Once he was identified, in fact, that was the trial Your Honors, as been held by this Court before.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="470.205" offset="1964382">They went there looking for a gun, but there was no seizure of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.589" offset="1985907">However, to pick up on your point, Your Honor, and which Mr. Justice White indicated, there is no doubt that a warrant would have been necessary to have seized the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.108" offset="2035958">It is our position that the seizure of the person is a greater intrusion than to go there to search and seize tangible evidence similar to that of a gun.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="497.505" stopTime="504.408">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="497.505" offset="2073574">Well, what you are saying is that a man, a person can never be arrested at his home without a warrant, that is what it adds up to, is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="504.408" offset="2101159">Except in those emergencies which this Court has found as an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.062" offset="2119759">For example, hot pursuit or if he is committing a crime inside the house in which the police have knowledge of it and the crime is being committed in their presence at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.900" offset="2171063">For example if he is committing an assault and another police officer were (Inaudible) but other than that, it is true that there is no entry into the home without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.478" offset="2241385">In regard to the jury issue, a power of search that the divided jury verdict was in violation of the equal protection provisions of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.834" offset="2278897">Louisiana jury system is unique in that it permits three types of jury verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.779" offset="2298645">In capital cases, the jury is 12, in which all the 12 must concur to enter a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.436" offset="2321215">And offenses similar to appellants, those necessarily punishable by hard labor, there is a jury of 12 of which only 9 have to concur to render a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.003" offset="2363533">And then in cases which may be punishable by hard labor, the jury is composed of five, again, all five of which must concur in order to render a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.426" offset="2409195">So we have greater offenses and lesser offenses in which the unanimity rule is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.825" offset="2430825">But not in appellant's case which are very serious felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.737" offset="2446498">Louisiana do not ever use it for this difference to reduce cause and expedite matters, is not a rational basis to extend the significant benefits for unanimity to some defendants and to deny to appellant's class.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.048" offset="2495713">There is no compelling State interest to which they can withhold their unanimity benefits to appellant and extend it to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.030" offset="2531657">An example of the prejudicial effect is that in capital crimes, an individual can be paroled within ten and a half years after sentence, whereas in armed robbery, an individual can get up to 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.210" offset="2580350">Appellant received 35 years with no chance of parole or pardon and they are in the same penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.539" offset="2625698">Unanimity requirement performs a significant role in protecting minority groups from discriminatory application of criminal laws by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.985" offset="2663419">This of course assumes that members of the minority defendants group are represented on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.052" offset="2691736">For the past 100 years, this Court has rendered numerous decisions to assure that members of appellant’s race are not entirely excluded from the jury panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.823" offset="2734786">A divided jury verdict may accomplish in a subtle indirect manner what this Court has ruled cannot be done directly and that is excluding members of appellant’s race from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.427" offset="2785254">There were three black male jurors on appellant’s jury, but the record does not reflect which jurors voted not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.461" offset="2829349">For various reasons in a capital case, majority juries may persuade the majority to return a verdict of guilty without capital punishment or guilty of a lesser included crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.079" offset="2871876">This can be accomplished because of the unanimity rule in a capital case in Louisiana which requires the majority jurors to take consideration of the minority view points.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.833" offset="2914822">However, this is precluded in the case in which appellant was tried wherein the majority can reject and not consider the minority view points.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.676" offset="2962260">Take for example, in view of the harsh penalty involved in this crime of armed robbery in Louisiana, the same minority, in appellant’s case may have been prepared and capable to persuade the minority to return a verdict of a lesser crime, say for example simple robbery, especially in view of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.228" offset="3048464">But as was true in this case a divided jury verdict will result in 97% of the trials in precluding the considerations and view points of the minority jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.795" offset="3118681">Divided jury verdicts permit the elimination of essential jury functions which this Court stressed and underscored in Williams versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.090" offset="3151909">The exclusion of any juror’s participation and the verdict produces results contrary to those Dandridge and Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.888" offset="3179076">For instance, the divided verdict is a split rather than shared responsibility of that verdict by the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.750" offset="3210528">It may prevent rather than promote group deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.960" offset="3227350">In this case the jury was out for less than 20 minutes suggesting a verdict in the first ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.098" offset="3259951">And instead of having actual community participation in the verdict, that nine out of twelve verdicts may in fact represent a pretrial, pre-deliberation, prejudice of the majority.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="808.031" offset="3315644">Mr. Buckley is there anything in this record to indicate the identities of the three jurors who did not join in the verdict of conviction, that is, their occupation, their race or anything else?</text>

            <text syncTime="821.678" offset="3370188">I checked the official ballot subsequent to the last argument and there is no indication there.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.082" offset="3423791">Also by excluding the view points of three minority jurors is very doubtful whether this verdict represents a common sense judgment of the jury panel of the 12 jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.603" offset="3497875">Furthermore, appellant’s conviction by a divided jury is a denial of a due process requirement that the state prove defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.322" offset="3536849">The purposes for the reasonable doubt standard make little sense without the unanimity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.083" offset="3563808">For example, instead of requiring a high degree of proof, majority verdicts allow guilty verdicts when three jurors have not been persuaded at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.750" offset="3610515">This suggests strongly that there is a possibility that the reasonable doubt standard was not even applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.166" offset="3648131">And rather than preserving community respect and competency in the criminal law, the majority verdict leaves people in doubt whether innocent persons are and maybe convicted, especially that part of the community when the defendant is black and the three unconvinced jurors are also black.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.657" offset="3754188">Substitution of a different standard for example, clearly convincing proof with the unanimity requirement would probably produce more certainty and fairness than a use of a reasonable doubt standard where 25% of a jury remains unconvinced as to defendant’s guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.986" offset="3883442">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.477" offset="3897444">The issue, the decision, two issues for decision before this Court today are clearly of whether Louisiana is going to be allowed to keep nine out of twelve jurors and its right to arrest a man in a home on probable cause without a warrant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="966.865" stopTime="969.266">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="966.865" offset="3950942">You refer to that as a right, do you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louise_korns" startTime="969.266" stopTime="1391.398">
            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="969.266" offset="3960555">Well, we have a statutory right, Mr. Justice Stewart under Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article, the Louisiana police have the right to make an arrest upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.317" offset="4016771">It is sort of like federal statutes, only it is a broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.654" offset="4030146">Instead of like a federal statutes saying narcotics agents can make arrest without -- we have set out in our brief, we have various articles of the criminal code, Louisiana Criminal Code saying that police officers may arrest for a crime when reasonable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed, it being committed and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.248" offset="4108513">And then an another article right after that says that an arrest maybe made anytime, any place and instead article says, these are all set out in the second part of our brief where we discussed this on page 21 of our brief, that the police may enter any dwelling to make an arrest if first, they announced their authority and purpose and then if they are a denied entry they may break the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.875" offset="4219063">In our brief, Louisiana took position and takes a position that both that our jury is alright under the Sixth Amendment and that our statutory laws permitting arrest in the home without warrant is valid under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.900" offset="4279145">However, in the alternative in this oral argument, I would like to advance this further alternative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.565" offset="4301819">That if this Court should hold that a nine to twelve jury is not permissible under the Sixth Amendment and an arrest in the home without warrant is not valid under the Fourth Amendment, but nevertheless both of these actions are valid under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the state should be permitted to follow them, even though the Federal Government cannot and I say this for these reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.164" offset="4396173">I realize that in making this argument I have to ask the Court not really to overrule, but to modify in these two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.209" offset="4432327">It is a holding that it has had gradually been developing during these past years as it selectively incorporated various guarantees of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.890" offset="4479034">Along with it this Court I think has also up until the present time fairly much held that that once -- that although -- it has never held, this -- a majority of this Court has never held that the Bill of Rights was automatically incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.059" offset="4547788">However, I think that the majority of this Court has increasingly been holding that once this Court finds that a guarantee in the Bill of Rights applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment then every facet, every constitutional standard of the -- the constitutional standard applying against the State Government and the Federal Government are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.217" offset="4628350">I believe I am right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.705" offset="4634306">Now, I was very much impressed in restudying this case for re-argument with Mr. Justice Fortas' concurring opinion in Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.927" offset="4667220">And thus I what I say in -- although our primary position is that a non-unanimous jury is permissible under the Sixth Amendment because of everything we set out in our brief, of the unanimity principle being deleted, the fact that four of the original 13 States had majority verdicts, the fact that many common law jurisdictions with juries presently have majority verdicts such as Scotland, England, went to it in 1967 and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.435" offset="4777248">So our first position is that a majority verdict jury is valid under Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.336" offset="4796892">In the alternative we say that if this Court should hold that it is not, it was not the intent of the framers that that the Federal Courts used juries which returned less than unanimous verdicts, we nevertheless alternatively take the position that there is nothing in the majority verdict that violates a due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and we ask this Court as Mr. Justice Fortas very, very intelligently pointed out in his concurring opinion in Duncan, a jury trial is not a principle of justice like self incrimination and the First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.169" offset="4948193">It is rather a system of procedure and he pointed out that he thought that if this Court insisted that the states and the Federal Government be -- with down to every single detail identical that we would have rigidity, conformism that we would -- it would go against our principle of federalism, they would prevent us from being able to try out one thing in one jurisdiction and another thing in another jurisdiction and he thought that this would have a very adverse effect on our whole principle of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.498" offset="5089463">And I think Mr. Justice, the late Mr. Justice Harlan, pointed out in his concur -- dissenting opinion in Williams this very the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.192" offset="5120288">He said that he thought that this Court should reexamine its whole -- the whole principle of incorporation because he said if it did not, that he thought there was going to be a labeling and rigid process that was going to set in making all the 50 States with their different problems and this is -- this -- but I make the same argument, in our Fourth Amendment argument about arrest without warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.243" offset="5216523">For instance, think of the State police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.907" offset="5227181">In Orange Parish alone, the police make a thousand arrests a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.066" offset="5243795">They are the peacekeepers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.610" offset="5249959">Unlike the federal police agents such as the FBI and the narcotics agents and these special agents who have very limited areas who do not cruise the city in police cars, who do not have to pick up runaway children, that is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.189" offset="5312235">But peacekeeping police like we have in Orleans Parish, while I had a case in the Court of Appeals last year where they made this same argument about a warrant you needed where the case involved a mother telling the police that her child was a runaway and she had good reason to believe that her child was staying at X child’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.069" offset="5391752">So the police went there and knocked on the door and asked for the child in question and when the little girl of the house, there were no adults in the house, said, the little girl in -- runaway girl was not there, the police went in and picked her up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.940" offset="5435324">The argument was made that they should have gone to the police station and spent two days swearing out a warrant and this is just one of the many examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.945" offset="5471269">What I mean the difference between a state police which has a problem of keeping the peace and federal agents which have an entirely different role, highly specialized role where they probably have time to go and swear out a warrant because the man they are pursuing is maybe a bank robber who is crossing the state line or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.249" offset="5560503">But – so, in this re-argument before this Court, there again, I think that history shows that an arrest within a house without a warrant way -- date way back to the 17th century in England in Semane's (ph) case, on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.901" offset="5627168">On probable cause the police have always been able to start going into a home and make an arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.762" offset="5946593">Because the injury to the person, when you go into a house for instance, a seizure of a person is completely different from rifling through drawers and desk drawers and so forth for things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.674" offset="6314188">Now, it is apparent from Mr. Buckley’s argument that he has not been Orleans parish in the past few years because right now, ever since we argued this case last month, I had been taking an interest in jury trials, the racial composition of jury trials and trying to figure out how they split and there is absolutely no pattern to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.182" offset="6412199">In the first place, there are at least five points, average 5.4 Negroes on every twelve-man jury in Orleans Parish now because they run up to eight in some juries and they are down to three or four in others, but they -- that five or six average, five and a half Negroes in every jury so they can well take care of themselves if they need three votes if they think it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.829" offset="6486805">There is case after case where the victim is black, the accused is black, they have six black jurors and six whites and they vote ten to two, six blacks, guilty of charged, 4 whites guilty as charged, two whites, not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.532" offset="6541662">I mean, this is just random because another time you will find another way, but there is absolutely no, nothing to show that the blacks have to protect themselves that they need a unanimous verdict to protect themselves because they are well able to protect themselves right now and generally they do not vote in a racist way.</text>
