            <text syncTime="47.559" offset="293595">In this case which is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Idaho, preemption is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.011" offset="335391">Whether the state court had jurisdiction over the action which respondent Wilson P. Lockridge filed against petitioner unions, or whether the state courts had no jurisdiction because Congress has regulated the union conduct involved in this case under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.975" offset="431313">For some years prior to 1959, respondent Lockridge was an interstate bus driver employed by the Greyhound Bus Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.465" offset="481259">Pursuant to the Check-off Clause in the collective bargaining contracts between Greyhound and the petitioner local division, Lockridge had been maintaining his union dues payments, and also, his employment with the Greyhound in as much as the collective-bargaining agreements provided that all employees shall remain members as a condition precedent to continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.522" offset="633501">The union constitution provided that where agreements with employing companies provide that members must be in continuous good financial standing, the member in arrears one month maybe suspended from membership and removed from employment in compliance with the terms of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.023" offset="711450">In August 1959, Lockridge and some others voluntarily revoked their check-off arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.534" offset="753560">They voluntarily assumed the responsibility of maintaining their union dues payments timely to maintain their membership in the union and also to maintain their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.161" offset="807999">In August 1959 and also in October 1959, the union in writing advised the -- Lockridge of the provisions to which I have adverted and pointed out that he had the responsibility to maintain these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.299" offset="884590">Nevertheless, he permitted his payments to become delinquent and the union so advised Greyhound, and in November 1959, being delinquent in his dues for the month of October, the union advised Greyhound of the delinquency and Greyhound discharged Lockridge.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac N. Groner</label>
            <text syncTime="282.317" offset="1232645">The record indicates two things with respect to that Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.780" offset="1254484">First of all that it acted uniformally with respect to everyone who had been given these notifications and were in this precise delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.567" offset="1297638">There was only one other such member, an employee named Elmer J. Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.022" offset="1323447">It also shows as a finding of fact that the union had suffered delinquencies -- had permitted other people who were in arrears a comparable length of time to remain in membership and to remain in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.456" offset="1393246">But there is nothing indicated that they had received the kind of notices which Messrs Lockridge and Day had received here.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.835" offset="1434728">In any event, Lockridge did not file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging either that he had not been treated like others in the same situation or making any other allegation of unfair labor practice under the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.620" offset="1525844">In September 1960, as a resident of Idaho, he instituted an action in the District Court for Boise, Idaho District Court for Boise against petitioner unions and originally also against Greyhound, naming Greyhound as a party defendant and including also a count specifically directed to the just cause provision of the collective-bargaining agreement and alleging that Greyhound had violated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.367" offset="1668890">Prior to any judicial action on the original complaint, however, Lockridge filed an amended complaint which removed Greyhound as a party defendant and also removed the particular count which had been addressed to Greyhound in its action under the collective-bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.211" offset="1748198">Basically in that amended complaint there were in essence three counts; One, tortuous interference with employment; two, violation of the contract between the union and the member and three, conspiracy all purporting to be stated under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.542" offset="1817579">The union’s filed a motion to dismiss, including among other things; the particular ground that the subject matter of Lockridge’s action was preempted by virtue of its regulation under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.562" offset="1877661">The district judge granted that motion, relying in principle part upon this Court’s decision in the Garmon case, Lockridge appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.854" offset="1930742">In 1962, the Idaho Supreme Court reversed holding that it was confused by the preemption decisions of this Court and in particular purporting to see confusion between the decision of this Court in the Gonzales case and the decision of this Court in the Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.886" offset="2022902">The case was remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.192" offset="2036172">Prior to trial, there was another amendment of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.462" offset="2053204">In all of these complaints and of course, in particular in the second amended complaint which was the basis for the trial, all that Lockridge sought was money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.855" offset="2102836">At no time did he request the relief of restoration to union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.849" offset="2130735">He had originally sought both compensatory damages and punitive damages, but in his second amended complaint, he excised the count which was addressed to punitive damages and he also cut out the prayer of a request for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.196" offset="2216208">In a preliminary ruling prior to trial, the Idaho District Court ruled that there was no ambiguity in the documents involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.025" offset="2267512">In essence, holding that the contract required that the employee remain a member, whereas the constitution required that members must be in good or the constitution referred to contracts which required that members must be in continuous good financial standing that court purporting to find that difference unambiguous and declining to permit the unions to file affidavits both from their officers and from Greyhound representatives which stated that no difference was intended that between the language and no difference was intended in the interpretation and application of the collective-bargaining agreement applicable here and other collective-bargaining agreements applicable to other drivers in the same bargaining unit which did have the continuously good financial standing language.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.203" offset="2504182">The trial was devoted primarily to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.174" offset="2520064">The district judge in Idaho held again that he believed that the matter was preempted and that the union’ position in this respect had been strengthen by the decisions of this Court in Borden and in Perko.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.320" offset="2588609">The 1962 decision of the Idaho Supreme Court was rendered prior to the decision of this Court -- decisions of this Court in Borden and in Perko.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.032" offset="2631450">And indeed, the Idaho Supreme Court in 1962 relied upon the state Supreme Court decisions in Borden and in Perko which were of course reversed on preemption grounds by the decisions of the this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.921" offset="2711071">The Idaho district judge felt, however, that he was mandated to proceed by the Idaho Supreme Court decision, and he awarded damages in which with interest approximate $50,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.482" offset="2761331">An appeal was taken by the unions on the ground of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.936" offset="2779094">The decision below affirmed by a vote of 4 to 1 both the majority and the dissenting opinions confining themselves to the issue of preemption, and indeed almost entirely to a discussion of the decisions of this Court featuring Borden and Perko.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.667" offset="3390046">He wanted no part of any federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.168" offset="3404048">He wanted no part of any action that could possibly be thought to be based on Section 301, so as to give rise to a right of removal in the unions; a right of removal to the federal District Court which would be acquainted with the act to a Court of Appeals which has had cases under Section 8 (b) (2) of the National Labor Relations Act which are directly in point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.901" offset="6799026">There’s no question that respondent Lockridge here sustained a substantial injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.360" offset="6824835">He has had his case in court now for more than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.186" offset="6844165">He was out of work entirely for almost four years of those 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.677" offset="6870079">In order to find another job, he had to move to a different part of the state and take a job at a much lower rate of pay than he had been earning with Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.904" offset="6918980">Not only has his earning level been reduced, he has also lost all of the benefits, retirement, medical coverage, burial benefits and other rights, he would have enjoyed if he had not been unlawfully suspended from union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.742" offset="6986376">This was all because he was two days late in paying $6.50 in Union dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.117" offset="7339865">If Lockridge is denied a remedy for these -- for the wrongs he has sustained, there will be a grave in justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.547" offset="7369540">He is a man of limited education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.717" offset="7382288">Without qualifications to do much else and drive a bus and he is a physical disability which limits his employment opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.854" offset="7422830">Now, the union argues that the remedy given him by the state court cannot stand because he filed the wrong form of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.460" offset="7457207">They say that if he filed a complaint asking only for restoration of his union membership, the case would have been within the jurisdiction of the state court as an internal union matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.688" offset="7502137">His mistake they say was that he asked for damages for loss of his employment, and that this changed the whole focus of this case to one for interference with his employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.899" offset="7550934">The union does seeks to make the question of jurisdiction turn on the form of the pleadings rather than on the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.776" offset="7586461">This of course would take us back to the old common law -- rules of common law pleading with all the hair splitting distinctions between different forms of action, whereas under current practice, it’s the substance accounts rather than the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.471" offset="7661275">The critical act which gave rise to this case was the suspension of respondent’s membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.751" offset="7694399">The loss of his job and loss of his income was a result of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.273" offset="7716446">The suit which he brought in the Idaho court was predicated on that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.068" offset="7739643">The money damages he claimed were simply the measure of the injury he sustained because of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.344" offset="7768795">For purposes of comparison, let us take a situation in which an individual is unlawfully arrested and detained in jail and as a consequence, he looses his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.453" offset="7813204">He brings suit against the person responsible for the unlawful arrest and he claims money damages for the loss of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.598" offset="7845804">The wrongful act on which such a suit is based is the false arrest and not the resulting interference with his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.009" offset="7879450">If the false arrest had not taken place, there would not have been any interference with his employment or consequent damages to him for loss of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.131" offset="7919888">So in the present case, the wrongful conduct upon which his suit is based is the unlawful suspension from union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.341" offset="7956773">Without this, there would be no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.867" offset="7974849">The issue to which the Idaho court addressed itself was the propriety of the union’s action in suspending respondent from membership, and it carefully reviewed and followed the decision of this Court in Gonzales in fashioning a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.495" offset="8037334">It pointed out that under Idaho law, the union constitution constitutes a contract between the union and its members, and that the wrongful cancellation of respondent’s union membership was a breach of contract for which the union is answerable in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.995" offset="8115388">The trial judge stated in his memorandum opinion and this is found on appendix a -- appendix 55, “I do not have jurisdiction over his employer-employee relation in this relationship in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.780" offset="8186441">It is my opinion that at most, I can restore him to his union membership as of the date of his wrongful termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.995" offset="8219355">In this, I am attempting to follow Gonzales as I see it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.350" offset="8240776">The Idaho Supreme Court similarly concluded that the trial court had authority to correct the breach of contract by ordering respondent restored to membership, and that in line with Gonzales, it had authority to fill out the remedy by awarding damages for his loss of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.489" offset="8325308">Petitioner's attempt to distinguish this case from Gonzales is really an exercise in semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.594" offset="8353729">The situation here is in all respects parallel to Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.837" offset="8374732">In that case, the employee brought suit in the California court claiming to have been wrongfully expelled from the union in violation of his rights under the union constitution, and he asked for damages for the resulting loss of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.571" offset="8441605">The California court entered judgment ordering his reinstatement and awarded damages for the lost earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.958" offset="8471176">When the case was reviewed by this Court, the union presented the same preemption argument that the petitioner is now advancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.789" offset="8506493">They asserted that the resulting termination of respondent’s employment involved discrimination in violation of Section 8 (b) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act, and was therefore a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.341" offset="8564694">This Court held that the National Labor Relations Act does not undertake to protect union members as their rights in their rights as members from arbitrary conduct by unions and union officers and therefore, the state court had the power to grant the remedy of reinstatement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.671" offset="8650062">This is in Gonzales Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.989" offset="8667303">The court held that the labor Act does not undertake to protect union members in their rights as members from arbitrary conduct by the union officers, and the state court therefore had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.478" offset="8721324">They went on -- the court went on to say that the state court had the power to fill out this remedy by an award of damages for lost of wages and suffering resulting from this breach of contract and pointed out “no radiation of the Taft-Hartley Act requires us to mutilate the comprehensive relief of equity in such a situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.154" offset="8828008">The facts in this case are so closely akin to those presented in Gonzales, it is most difficult to see how this case could be decided in any other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.335" offset="8868760">The Borden and Perko cases involved substantially different factual situations than the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.450" offset="8897181">One involved the hiring hall referral system under which the union refused to refer man to a job, and the other involved discharge of a foreman for assigning work to another trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.744" offset="8954337">Neither of those cases involved wrongful suspension of union membership and neither affected the vitality of the Gonzales decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.119" offset="9011806">It was not necessary in any event for the Idaho Supreme Court to rely exclusively on Gonzales in deciding the question of State versus NLRB jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.092" offset="9063737">On the basis of the pleadings, the court could have found that respondent had stated a proper cause of action under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, which authorizes suits for violation of collective bargaining contracts between employers and unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.838" offset="9138761">It was clear from the facts alleged in the complaint and found by the court that respondent’s discharge from his employment, at the time when he was still legally and rightfully a member of the union was a breach of the existing collective contract between the union and Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.268" offset="9224443">This Court has held in a series of cases, including Smith versus Evening News, 371 U.S., Humphrey versus Moore in 375 U.S., and Vaca versus Sipes in 386 U.S. that an employee discharged without cause may sue the employer or the union under Section 301 in either federal or state courts, not withstanding that the discharge also involves an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.287" offset="9364564">In the Evening News case, an employee of a newspaper brought suit in a Michigan court asserting discriminatory action by his employer in violation of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.108" offset="9415764">The discrimination focused on employment during a strike, allowing non-union employees to report for work and paying them even though there was no work available, but denying a similar privilege to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.758" offset="9474382">The state courts refused to entertain the suit, holding that the discrimination was an unfair labor practice under -- within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB under the Garmon rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.718" offset="9526209">This Court reversed, holding that the action arose under Section 301 and was not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.518" offset="9557452">The court said and I quote “in Lucas Flour as well as in Atkinson, the court expressly refused to apply the preemption doctrine of the Garmon case, and we likewise reject that doctrine here where the alleged conduct of the employer, not only arguably, but concededly is an unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.051" offset="9647626">The authority of the board to deal with an unfair labor practice which also violates a collective-bargaining agreement is not displaced by Section 301, but it is not exclusive and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the courts in suits under 301.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.056" offset="9719620">In Vaca against Sipes, again, this Court noted that under the section, that is 301, “the courts have jurisdiction over suits to enforce collective-bargaining agreements, even though the conduct of the employer which is challenged as a breach of contract is also arguably an unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the labor board.</text>
