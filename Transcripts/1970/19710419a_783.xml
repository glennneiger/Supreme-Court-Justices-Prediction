            <text syncTime="12.877" offset="156881">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.387" offset="190945">This is an important case because it poises the -- a famous athlete, the heavyweight or ex-heavyweight champion of the world against the United States Selective Service System, which treated him we say, unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.548" offset="263565">May it be recalled that in February 1964, the so called Louisville Lip, so called because of his loquaciousness to say the least, he just won the championship of mid great public acclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.565" offset="327722">He had just announced that time that he was a so called Black Muslim.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.621" offset="351859">At that time, they were considered to be terrorists or subversives because the justice department then was wiretapping his leader, the honorable Elijah Mohammed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.927" offset="397103">Well, soon after he won the championship in March of 1964, it was announced by the officials by the Selective Service System that he had been given two qualifications test, and he had failed both and had been given the classification of 1-Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.330" offset="470768">Almost two years went by and after many reams of newspaper copy, he was then sent on February 3, 1966 a statement of his acceptability, this because the Selective Service System had lowered his qualifications for admissions into the Armed Forces.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="109.716" offset="544329">What is the classification 1-Y of the (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="chauncey_eskridge" startTime="113.861" stopTime="649.257">
            <label>Mr. Chauncey Eskridge</label>
            <text syncTime="113.861" offset="560839">1-Y means that he is not then, or that he'd only been taken in case of war or national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.678" offset="596156">On February 14, 1966, he wrote a letter to his local draft board, alleging facts which he claims entitled him under the law to several lower classifications, including that of the conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.229" offset="666373">Without more, on the February 17, 1966, his local board reclassified him.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.799" offset="692600">Then the next day, the local board sent him the usual form 150, which is the application for a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.512" offset="739516">Then on the February 28, he sent the application back, which showing on the face of this application what we consider to be a prima facie entitlement to the status of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.678" offset="796150">In his handwriting, he wrote, “Muslim means peace, total submission to the will of Allah, do not take the lives of anyone, nor war when ordered -- when not ordered by Allah” and in parenthesis he has the word (God, keep our prayers and pay poor rates), that's quotation from his form 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.755" offset="908476">And the form 50 maybe found in page 17a of the appendix -- I'm sorry, on page 12 a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.729" offset="960303">He then appeared before his draft board on March 17, 1966 and the notes of the clerk or the minutes of that meeting appear on page 17a of the appendix and they will get them important, because the notes of the minutes of that meeting are later quoted by the Government as being pertinent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.787" offset="1052568">Then the appeal process starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.682" offset="1064166">As you remember in those days, you made an -- you make an application to the Appeal Board, and the Appeal Board refers the matter to the United States Justice department, and the United States Justice department at that time appointed under the statute, a hearing officer who was to have a hearing on good faith and character of the registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.480" offset="1155385">In this case, it is important that the hearing officer was an ex-chief, an ex-judge, a retired judge from the system of Kentucky, a man in his 60's and who had been on the bench many number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.586" offset="1243784">And that this judge had this hearing, his name was Judge Grauman.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.152" offset="1270011">Now, Judge Grauman heard several witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.043" offset="1297596">He also had in front of him, the record shows that an FBI report of about six inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.396" offset="1326958">He also was given at the hearing two books, one of which was called the “Message to the Black Man” written by the honorable Elijah Mohammed, and another book entitled “The Holy Qur'an” by Muhammad Ali, not our Muhammad Ali, another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.008" offset="1409400">And there was also introduced a copy of a newspaper that put out by his sect, the Muslims called it the “Muhammad Speaks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.954" offset="1449211">Now, Judge Grauman, he had the first opportunity to determine the credibility of the witnesses and he could determine whether how much credence to put in the testimony of the people in front of him and Judge Grauman wrote his report, and his report appears on page 17a.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.647" offset="1584003">In some of his notations in what we call the advice letter which is written by the Attorney General -- written by the Selective Service System, I mean, the justice department and this is where we consider the crux of this case is in the so called advice letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.837" offset="1680760">Now, the hearing officer wrote his report and he concluded at page 117a in the appendix that the registrant is sincere in his objections on religious ground, to participation in war in any form and he recommended that the conscientious objector claim of the registrant be sustained, notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.355" offset="1790892">The justice -- at that time, the Justice department had a conscientious objector section and all letters are written by a man by the name of T. Oscar Smith who was in charge of the section and this letter was written back signed by T. Oscar Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.946" offset="1881172">And then after having said that the hearing officer had found the registrant sincere, at page 128, he then quotes from “Muhammad Speaks” seven lines from the newspaper “Muhammad Speaks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="462.527" offset="1955568">Then the next paragraph he gives, that is the writer of the letter gives his opinion of what “Muhammad Speaks” says and what “Message of Black Man” says, it's in the bottom of page 120 and beginning 121, then he gives his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.729" offset="2028293">It seems clear on reading these two documents that the teachings of the nation of Islam precludes fighting for the United States, not because of objections to participation in war in any form, but rather because a political and and racial objections to policies the United States as interpreted by Elijah Muhammad.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.283" offset="2118572">Then he goes on and he reads a part of a hypothetical question which Muhammad Ali, the registrant had answered at the hearing before the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.916" offset="2169041">Then he quotes part of registrant's testimony, and then he comes to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.412" offset="2203105">“It is therefore our conclusion that the registrant claimed objections to participation of war insofar as they are based upon the teachings of the nation of Islam rest on grounds which are primarily political and racial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="540.996" offset="2269456">Now we say that when these men who are on the Appeal Board, who had to read this advice letter, with this language, they interpret it like we interpret it that this is as same as saying that the -- his objection to the war were based on political or racial grounds and not on his religion training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.639" offset="2367990">Now, we understand that now the Government in its brief, page 30 -- page 27 in Government's brief, now say that that language was not intended to say they were not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.314" offset="2434654">Now, the Government says that this language was or that Muhammad Ali was one who had his belief rooted in religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.093" offset="2493795">But now they say that political and racial and if you interpret it, they say that the record infers the inference that petitioner would fight “tomorrow” in a defensive war on behalf of Muslims.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.858" offset="2568819">This reminds us of the case of Sicurella where the hypothetical questions was put to Jehovah's Witness, what they would they do if they did so and so, or if so and so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.898" offset="2625034">Now, they have taken some language, juxtapose against other language, and they come to this conclusion, but nowhere in the record as the registrant ever said that he would fight with weapons against anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.454" offset="2699222">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="686.639" offset="2851986">And it -- they use it and they couple it with the black man's experience in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.296" offset="2878631">Hence, there's somewhat, it's not clear as to how much they interpret from the Holy Qur'an, how much they interpret from the Bible or from the Message to Black Man.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.157" offset="4474086">This is a small group of men who are young men, who are given this kind of training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.348" offset="4490804">And they intended that it'll be used only in defense of themselves or against in defense of their leaders, so that to suggest here that they would use this for a use for weapons against other persons, they don't say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.680" offset="4568127">They just say that they're totally -- their total defense are with their hands when attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.615" offset="4595921">This is their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.042" offset="4605639">Now, we go farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.073" offset="4617759">We say that if you read this advice letter in which the Department of Justice disparages the religion, and then it adds further down at page 125a, then they go on after they say that his religions is racious and political.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.505" offset="4707412">Then they go on and the registrant -- this device that are to the Appeal Board says “The main thrust of the letter that he had written in which he claims other, other classifications.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.551" offset="4767598">Then they say that there's something wrong with this that he has shifted his position, but remember he was 1-Y all the way up to February 1966, so that he had no occasion to apply for a lower qualification because conscientious objector is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.830" offset="4844711">So that the hearing officer, when they wrote to the Appeal Board, they should have told the Appeal Board that it wasn't necessary for him to inform the draft board that he was then a conscientious objective because this was a higher classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.020" offset="4913465">But notwithstanding that, they go on and say “The registrant has not shown manifest over at manifestations sufficient to establish his subjective belief whereas here, his conscientious objector claim was not asserted until military service became eminent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.846" offset="4988803">In other words, you're saying that he had a lack of sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.408" offset="5007088">Now, not only did this mislead the Appeal Board we say, but this even misled the Fifth Circuit, because in the last opinion of the Fifth Circuit on page 249, footnote 9, the Fifth Circuit on its opinion says, “The Kentucky Appeal Board thereafter continued the 1-A classification of Clay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.058" offset="5117639">That there was also a basis of fact for the numerous local boards, State Appeal Boards and Presidential Appeal Boards classification of Clay, thereby including an adverse determination of the question of Clay's basic sincerity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.042" offset="5177616">So that this language, we say of his sincerity through off not only the Appeal Board, but through off the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.030" offset="5225576">We're asking the Court to take into account that Sicurella also said that where two erroneous positions or one erroneous position was given to an Appeal Board or local draft board that this requires a reversal of a man's conviction because the Court has no way of knowing whether or not one -- which one the draft board accepted because here, the record does not indicate which one of the grounds that the Appeal Board rested upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.341" offset="5422749">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.879" offset="5440930">This is an appeal from a judgment sustaining a conviction for refusal to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.224" offset="5478337">The defense of course is the question whether the order to report for induction was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.533" offset="5503519">In the posture of the case as it now stands that turns on the propriety of the action of the Selective Service System with respect to a claim of conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.062" offset="5557645">The claim was duly filed on the system's form SS150 and was considered by the local board in Kentucky and was denied by that board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.197" offset="5614174">The petitioner here took an appeal from that decision and under the procedure which was then established by law, the matter was referred to a division of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.914" offset="5689093">The statute provided upon the filing of such appeal, “The Appeal Board shall refer any such claim to the Department of Justice for inquiry and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.397" offset="5730994">The Department of Justice after appropriate inquiry shall hold a hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.485" offset="5751369">And then it provided that the department should make its report to the Appeal Board either way and said -- the statute said, “The Appeal Board shall in making its decision, give consideration to, but shall not be bound to follow the recommendation of the Department of Justice together with the record on appeal from the local board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.723" offset="5860352">That procedure was followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.088" offset="5873727">There was a hearing conducted by an able and experienced hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.176" offset="5906119">He made his report, including a transcript of the testimony and a voluminous number of exhibits to the Department of Justice where it was reviewed along with the experience which the department's officers had from reviewing many other hearings in this type of matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.864" offset="5988874">And the Department of Justice prepared its letter of advice which appears in the record, beginning on page 112 and running for 16 pages, in which it recommended against the allowance of the conscientious objector claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.368" offset="6074870">Now that was approved by the Appeal Board in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.894" offset="6097021">It was later approved by an Appeal Board in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.038" offset="6117606">There was an appeal to the so called Presidential Board, and it was approved by the Presidential Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.063" offset="6153655">Thereafter, the case was tried in the District Court and there were decisions sustaining the action of the Department of Justice advice letter in the District Court and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.101" offset="6209870">And the case is now here on the grant of certiorari limited to the question of the application of this Court's decision in the Welsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.237" offset="6266399">Now, the transcript of the hearing before the hearing officer is in the appendix, but I think it is very important for the Court to bear in mind what the nature of that hearing was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.597" offset="6327839">It was not an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.402" offset="6342990">The Government was not represented except through the hearing officer who its perfectly plain, acted in the most impartial way and asked questions for the purpose of clarifying things for his own mind, but not in an adversary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.712" offset="6404221">No evidence was offered on behalf of the Government at this hearing, either with respect to the beliefs of the Black Muslim sect, or with respect to the beliefs of the petitioner, except insofar as that may appear from the resume' of the FBI report which was made a part of the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.928" offset="6605155">There has been one other case before the Court, involving a Black Muslim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.352" offset="6630860">That's the case of United States against Carson, in which this Court denied certiorari in 396 U.S., 865 and where the Solicitor General in his brief in opposition took the ground that the objection of the Black Muslim was essentially a selective objection and I can refer on that connection to what this Court said in its recent Gillette opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.991" offset="7265426">But this is a question in which Congress has provided in the statute that the judgment of the draft board shall be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.401" offset="7299072">And the Court has said that the standard of review is no basis in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.982" offset="7333345">Many years ago in the Estep case, the Court said and I read from the opinion; Referring to the provision for finality in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.329" offset="7482765">And so I take it that the question here is whether there is any basis in fact, not whether the balance of the evidence having in mind among other things that this was not an adversary proceeding should go one way or another, but whether there is any basis in fact for the decisions which have been reached by the administrative agencies and by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.950" offset="7577224">And then I would call attention to this Court's decision in the Witmer case in 348 U.S. where the Court said “It is well to remember that it is not for the courts to sit as super draft boards substituting their judgments on the weight of the evidence for those of the designated agencies, nor should they look for substantial evidence to support such determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.372" offset="7690909">The classification can be overturned only if it has no basis in fact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.174" offset="7722151">Here, the determination has been made by the draft board, approved by two State Appeal Boards by the National Appeals Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.808" offset="8304682">Mr. Justice I believe it does just as in the Negre case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.079" offset="8321714">I think this case has been in effect decided by the Negre case and that it is in fact indistinguishable from the Negre case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.837" offset="8356718">Now, let us look back at the Negre case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.505" offset="8371451">There is a case where the objection was undeniably religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.320" offset="8390677">Nobody questioned from beginning to end that Mr. Negre was anything, but a sincere and devout catholic deriving his beliefs from instruction in the church and from teachings of the fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.819" offset="8456714">He believed on undoubtedly religious grounds that it was his duty to participate in just wars, and his duty not to participate in unjust wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.965" offset="8501332">Now, the Government never contended in anyway that his objections were other than religious in nature, nevertheless, the Government did contend that they were political and practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.413" offset="8555039">This is a contention within the concept of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.219" offset="8574265">The Government's arguments sustained by the Court is that it is not enough that the objection be religious, but it must also be an objection to participation in war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.016" offset="8629436">And without that, the Court's discussion of the establishment and the free exercises clauses of the First Amendment in its opinion, a very constructive and helpful discussion would have been wholly unnecessary because it is -- that is relevant only if the objections are clearly religious, and so they were and so we concede here that the objections are religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.462" offset="8747301">But the distinction between just and unjust wars, those surely having a religious basis in Negre's mind injected political and philosophical considerations into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.573" offset="8803725">And it was with respect to this aspect of the matter that the Government contended in its brief that Negre's position involvement a judgment that is “political and particular,” that was one “based on the same political, sociological and economic factors that the Government necessarily considered” in deciding to undertake the war and those passages from the Government's brief are quoted by the Court in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.628" offset="8943950">And similarly here, we do not contend that the petitioner's claim is not religious and we never have contended that his claim is not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.354" offset="8990866">The contention that it is political and racial is not necessarily a contention that it is not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.598" offset="9019810">It is a contention which is entirely consistent with its being religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.363" offset="9038827">If a man sincerely believes that he can participate in racial wars or in just wars, he is not a person who is opposed to participation in war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.506" offset="9103402">There is in this record a basis in fact for the conclusion that the petitioner's objection, though religious, is selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.478" offset="9147288">Now that is that he is not opposed to participation in war in any form as statute requires, but that is in fact to oppose to fighting what he regards as the white man's wars, although having no religious or conscientious scruples against participation in war which would defend the black man's interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.911" offset="9365044">But it's not the same sort of belief as the opposition to participation in war in any form which is held by the pacifist, and is required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.243" offset="9414363">Now surely as has been pointed out, the traditional, historical Muslim religion is not pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.853" offset="9456786">One need only refer to the crusades and to the more recent seven days war is adequate evidence of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.151" offset="9498060">And although my -- counsel for the petitioner here differentiated his client from the traditional Muslims, I would point out that they introduced an evidence in support of his position a modern standard translation of the Qur'an, a translation by a Pakistani, not by a member of the Black Muslims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.219" offset="9598265">It's equally sure it seems to me that the Black Muslim religion is not regarded as pacifist, in the sense at least that the Quakers and the Mennonites are pacifists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.273" offset="9646540">As this record shows, there are strong racial undertones in the Black Muslim religion, and in the petitioner's beliefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.205" offset="10346203">I shall refer to some parts of the record which I think will support the fact that there is a basis in fact for saying that his objections are selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.779" offset="10396568">That is that he is not opposed to participation in war in any form but that he wants to pick and choose his wars, and his pick is essentially a racial and political choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.847" offset="10452783">Now, of course in reviewing the case, the Court will undoubtedly give close and careful attention to the report or advice letter of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.924" offset="10505132">If with the benefit of hindsight, one goes through this letter looking for flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.173" offset="10526135">One can find some matters that might have been written differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.699" offset="10544212">But if the letter is read from beginning to end in its entirety, one will conclude I think that it is a very careful thoughtful letter, written by a responsible officer, in the special section under Department of Justice which was set up for the purpose of examining into these difficult questions, and which though not binding on the draft boards, would make a contribution toward thoughtful, uniform national standards on these questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.555" offset="10727591">Now three objections are made to the letter and they don't present easy questions and if one reads the petitioner's brief alone, it's quite plausible, particularly when one is looking for flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.211" offset="10782239">On more careful examination, however, I believe that the views expressed in the Department of Justice's advice letter were sound and are wholly consistent with this Court's decisions both before and after the letter was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.330" offset="10850785">I think it should be borne in mind that the letter was written after the Seeger decision, of course before the Welsh decision, but on the whole, there is not a great deal of difference between the Welsh and the Seeger decision in their practical application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.506" offset="10927480">It's first said that the department's conclusion that the petitioner's beliefs were primary, political and racial, was a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.492" offset="10967395">I've already endeavored to view with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.713" offset="10980248">It is I believe entirely refuted by the Negre case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.197" offset="11002190">No one questioned that Negre's views were based on religious belief, yet they were found by the Court to be so political in essence, so inconsistent with the pacifist position which Congress has recognized in the statute, a pacifist position which need not be based on orthodox religion as it was, but nevertheless must still be a pacifist position that they are not a basis for exemption and the Court specifically held that this was consistent with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.797" offset="11140639">Similarly here as I've said, the petitioner's views are religious, that's not questioned, but they are also selective just as Negre's were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.472" offset="11187346">The petitioner's opposition to war is not total.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.828" offset="11204692">There are political and racial exceptions to his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.943" offset="11225172">There may be room to argue about the evidence on this, but there is much evidence that it is so, and thus there was an adequate basis in fact for the conclusions reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.694" offset="11284208">Probably the most difficult case for us on this point is the Sicurella decision where the Court held and we surely do not disagree that the willingness of a Jehovah's Witness to participate at some time in a theocratic war without carnal weapons was not a sufficient basis for denying him exemption on the ground that he was not opposed to participation in war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.700" offset="11420254">Now, there's some related material in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.058" offset="11429658">There is some references to Armageddon and to the ultimate battle of the Lord against the devil, and the suggestion that members of the lost/found nation of Islam must be spiritually prepared for the eventuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.507" offset="11487441">As far as that's concerned, Sicurella surely is applicable, but there's also a reference in this record to a holy war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.602" offset="11523803">That's on page 68a, and here again we will show the tie-end between the petitioner and the traditional Muslim religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.312" offset="11582631">This is the petitioner himself testifying at the hearing, “But the Holy Qur'an do teach us that we do not take part of in any part of war unless declared by Allah Himself, or unless it's an Islamic world war or a holy war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.380" offset="11658909">And it goes as far the Holy Qur'an is still talking, and saying we are not to even as much as aid the infidels or the none believers in Islam, even to as much as handing them a cup of water during battle.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.209" offset="11722230">And there are other items at this record which support the selective nature of the petitioner's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.392" offset="11762981">Page 18, the summary of his first hearing before the board, Clay objects to being in service because he has no quarrel with the Vietcong, and page 79a and 80 of the record, there is read to him a quotation from the Chicago Daily News, which he not only says he may but he says he believes is true, beginning at the bottom of page 79a; “Let me tell you what Muslims are taught, to defend ourselves when we are attacked.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.314" offset="11922641">Now that's not consistent with the pacifist position, but then continuing “those Vietcong are not attacking me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.303" offset="11962661">These Vietcong are riding a very nasty war over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.401" offset="11979065">There's a lot of people getting killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.546" offset="11987634">Why should we Muslims get involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.964" offset="11997247">Besides, I'm fighting for the Government everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.270" offset="12006546">I'm laying out my life on the line for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.339" offset="12018772">9 out of 10 soldiers would not want to be in my place in the ring, it's too dangerous.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.987" offset="12041341">Now he says later on that he was chided by Elijah Muhammad for making such a boastful statement, but he does not deny that he made it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.999" offset="12153459">Then I would call attention to page 165a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.958" offset="12173208">This is a letter written by Clay himself to the draft board and introduced in evidence at the hearing and for alliance from the bottom of page 165a; “Last but not least, the mention is the stand that I took publishly as a conscientious objector to the war in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.514" offset="12251470">The Illinois Boxing Commission challenged me and ruled that it would permit me to participate in the Ernie Terrell fight to defend my world championship title which would have brought me $2 million, only if I would apologize and retract the words that I stated publicly describing my conscientious scruples against participation in the war in Vietnam.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.245" offset="12338406">And then finally on page 185 of the record is an extract from a paper called “Muhammad Speaks” which was introduced in evidence at the hearing, and this is a statement of the Black Muslim belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.120" offset="12413952">Page 185; “We believe that we who declared ourselves to be righteous Muslims should not participate in wars which takes the lives of humans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.341" offset="12454808">We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars for we have nothing to gain from it, unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory, wherein we may have something to fight for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.845" offset="12516770">Now there are a number of other passages in the record to which reference is made in our brief and I shall have to refer to the brief for a further discussion of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.847" offset="12576852">If one reads this letter like a jury charge, perhaps one can find some error in it, particularly at passage on page 127 in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.894" offset="12641008">However, I don't think that it can be so fairly taken out of context, and I call attention to the fact that in the petitioner's brief itself, it's referred -- in the petitioner's petition at page 52, it is referred to as an implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.485" offset="12707359">It has taken on greater strength in their later arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.016" offset="12745498">We submit on the basis of the materials presented and further developed in our brief that the record clearly presents the basis in fact for the Appeal Board's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.084" offset="12793772">There's no question about the petitioner's objections being religious in nature, and so no question about the Welsh case is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.999" offset="12829403">Insofar as there is a question remaining in the case, it is covered by this Court's long standing decision in Estep which established the basis in fact rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.238" offset="12878409">Using the words of the Court in Witmer against the United States, “it is the policy of Congress to make review within this Selective Service System final in all cases where there was conflicting evidence, or where two inferences could be drawn from the same testimony.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Chauncey Eskridge</label>
            <text syncTime="3438.276" offset="13858523">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.718" offset="13864270">If you take the first sentence, there's two sentences there and now we're reading in the back of Muhammad Speaks newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.925" offset="13897080">These ten points appear on the back of Muhammad Speaks newspaper, and the Solicitor General spoke of the Carson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.021" offset="13929472">In that case, the same words, “we believe that we who declared ourselves to be righteous Muslims should not participate in wars which take the lives of humans.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.326" offset="13978687">Then they go out “We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.399" offset="13999062">It forces to take part in such wars if we have nothing to gain from it, unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we have, may have something to fight for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.755" offset="14044411">Now, this language is ambiguous, but it doesn't suggest that they will fight with weapons in war and in the Negre case, I mean in the Carson case, I would like to read you something that the Department of Justice said, “that at best, Carson's objections, the war is based on political, social and economic consideration and not religious.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.942" offset="14141168">So that they are taking a position, in the Carson case, it was not religious, and they're taking position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.002" offset="14165410">I sense a prejudice against the so called Black Muslims that appears in the Government's briefs and which it appears against this defendant who was the heavy weight champion of the world, and whom who had announced that he was a Muslim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.550" offset="14227581">And it is that we submit to Your Honor that this contrived language and to -- and the hearing -- the advice letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.847" offset="14260809">Now we don't say that the advice letter, one that's put to the nine justices of the Supreme Court, this advice letter went to Layman who made up the Appeal Board of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.598" offset="14303859">They had to read this letter and if you all can't get this interpretation, how did this Appeal Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.059" offset="14325697">We say in Sicurella that if there are two erroneous grounds in here, they admit to sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.593" offset="14359761">In the advice letter, they did not admit to sincerity and in this advice letter, the language is set, they didn't even admit that he was even more religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.399" offset="14378987">So we're saying to Your Honor, that you have to reverse on the grounds of Sicurella because this is the -- the issues this case and not as how the Justice department finds it.</text>
