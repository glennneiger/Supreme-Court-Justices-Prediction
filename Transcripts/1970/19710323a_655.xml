            <text syncTime="52.753" offset="314389">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.074" offset="335705">This case was brought by the Secretary of Labor under Title IV sometimes called the Union Democracy Provisions of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.603" offset="393801">It was brought to set aside the 1967 election of officers of the respondent Local Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.413" offset="429014">After the election a member of the Local who had been an unsuccessful candidate for President protested the elections conduct to the Union and after relief was denied filed a complaint with the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.324" offset="496619">His internal protest with the Union had complained among other things of the use of Union facilities to prepare campaign literature for the incumbent president who was his opponent in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.752" offset="558373">His complaint with the Secretary repeated this charge and added for the first time a charge that an unreasonably restrictive meeting-attendance requirement had been imposed as a condition for candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.163" offset="623992">After investigating the election, the Secretary concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the Act had been violated with respect to each of these matters and he advised the respondent Unions of these findings and invited them to discuss the findings and to take internal remedial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.763" offset="718451">When after discussions the respondent Unions refused to undertake remedial measures and either of these matters, the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.053" offset="767561">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals upheld the Secretary’s complaint with respect to the use of Union facilities to promote the candidacy of the incumbent president.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.735" offset="818343">The election for that office was accordingly ordered set aside on that ground and that aspect of the judgment below is not at issue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.748" offset="866408">What is at issue are the rulings of the courts with respect to the validity of the meeting-attendance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.576" offset="901726">The District Court held that the Secretary did have authority or standing to raise that issue in this litigation even though it had not been a subject of the member’s complaint with the Union but the District Court upheld the meeting-attendance requirement on the merits as authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.375" offset="1004857">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment but on the ground that the Secretary did not have standing to raise this issue and the suit, did not reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.949" offset="1051146">In our petition for certiorari we asked this Court to decide the standing issue and if it decided the standing issue in our favor also to go on and reach the issue on the merits since it is an issue of national importance involved in litigation against several locals of the Steelworkers Union around the country and the respondents have joined in urging that both issues be reach if the standing issue is indeed resolved in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.067" offset="1191685">Now if the Court please, I plan first to discuss the standing issue and that in the course of discussing the second issue to summarize the facts that relate to the issue of the validity of the meeting-attendance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.794" offset="1270575">The provisions of the statute relevant to the standing issue can be found in the appendix to our brief on pages 28 and 29 of the brief in Section 402 of the Act and I wish first to direct the Court’s attention to Section 402 (b) on page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.902" offset="1395022">And there the governing statutory language is that after a member of the organization has filed the complaint, the Secretary shall investigate such complaint and if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation of this Title has occurred and his not been remedied he shall within a certain time bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.491" offset="1513305">Now, as we point it out in our brief the statutory language is consistent with our position that the Secretary has authority indeed it supports our position of the Secretary has authority to raise in the lawsuit any violation which his investigation discloses to have occurred in the election concerning which the complaint has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.460" offset="1621243">And we noted also that in the course of the legislative history, Congress had before it a drafted an alternative bill which would have limited the lawsuit to the particular allegation made in the complaint and while there’s no explicit reason given in the course of the legislative history for the choice of this language rather than the alternative language we think there is significance in the fact that this broader formulation was chosen by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.067" offset="1747675">Mr. Wallace, straight from that on one thing, do I understand correctly that if there is no complaint filed, the Secretary has no investigatory powers under Section 402 (b)?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.925" offset="1855091">He will have powers only to advice the Union if he believes that the Unions procedures were not in accordance with the Act but those powers are conferred under another Section of the Act which is not reproduced in our appendix, Section 601.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.192" offset="2036172">Well, the Secretary can investigate and inform the Union but cannot bring a lawsuit in the absence of a complaint, that is our argument and I’ll elaborate on the reasons for it in just a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.885" offset="2266885">That is correct and presumably never would have gone to the Secretary if the Union had redressed to specific violation which he complained.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="557.143" offset="2331982">And then he does the same things virtually that the Union member who is complaining of something does, doesn’t he?</text>
            <text syncTime="564.299" offset="2360613">In which he sits down with the Union officials to see if they will not themselves do something about it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="570.853" stopTime="705.695">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="570.853" offset="2386735">That is correct except unlike the Union member he does not have ultimate redress to anyone who can then bring a lawsuit, [Laughter] if the negotiations are unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.868" offset="2434800">Now, before we leave the face of the statute we think there is another provision in Section 402 which has great bearing on this question and that is on page 29 of our brief, subsection C-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.829" offset="2502719">And that indicates that if the Secretary suit is successful the court shall set aside the election declare the election if any to be avoid and direct the conduct of a new election under the supervision of the Secretary and so far as lawful impracticable inconformity with the constitution and by-laws of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.043" offset="2619538">This raises a considerable problem if the scope of the lawsuit brought by the Secretary is to be limited only to the complaint raise by the Union member because the Secretary is charge if he is successful in that lawsuit with supervising a new election in conformity with the constitution and by laws in so far as they are lawful and in this instance the Secretary was of the view with that at the meeting-attendance requirement as a condition of candidacy was not lawful as alternative if he could not raise that issue in the litigation would be there to supervise the election applying what he believe to be a candidacy qualification violative of the Act or to delay the election while this issue is separately litigated before the new election is conducted which we think would be inconsistent with Congress’ purpose to expedite the provision of relief under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.645" offset="2877942">Once the District Court has in fact found the violation of the statute provides that there can be no stay of the District Court judgment setting aside the election and ordering a new one while that judgment is appeal.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="705.695" stopTime="745.779">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="705.695" offset="2926111">But Mr. Wallace if he sets aside the election of the president and wants to order a new election he can certainly conduct the election in accordance with the law without setting aside the election for their officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.963" offset="3003225">And even if he was right about being able to litigate the meeting-attendance rules in order to conduct the right kind of an election, is it necessarily to follow that he must set aside the election of officers previously elected with which all the members seem to be satisfied?</text>

            <text syncTime="745.779" offset="3086503">There is the possibility of this intermediate position that only that particular election would then be conducted in conformity with the law as the Secretary views the law and as the courts presumably would have uphold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.020" offset="3151496">But this would have the disadvantage that admittedly the other officers would have been elected unlawfully under that very decision and yet their election would stand which --</text>

            <text syncTime="776.498" offset="3209383">Well, that may be true but as I understand it you say one of the purposes of this statute was to cause the Union self-government in the sense that the Secretary can intervene in an election and all the members happen to be satisfied with it.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="793.751" stopTime="795.069">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>

            <text syncTime="800.058" offset="3303633">How it does it for the purpose of the Act permit the Secretary to have set any other election but the president?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="805.389" offset="3324949">Once his intervention is warrant under the statute then it seems to us on a proper reading of the legislative history and what this Court has said about the statute that the scope of the redress is not to be limited by what may have been the limited perception of the individual complain into what was wrong with the election or by his own self interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.982" offset="3431320">There is a broader public interest to be serve by the Secretary’s intervention once its warranted and as the Court put the matter in the Glass Bottle Blowers case in 389 U.S. although Congress was committed to minimal intervention it was obviously equally committed to making that intervention once warranted effective in carrying out the basic aim of Title IV which is to assure free and Democratic Union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.759" offset="3566425">Perhaps the most significant thing about the legislative history of Title IV is that Congress chose to invest the enforcement authority in the Secretary rather than in the individual complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.854" offset="3626820">At one time a bill was passed in the House which would have made the rights enforceable by private suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.612" offset="3657853">But as finally enacted the law recognizes that there is a broader public interest to be served and not merely they redress of individual grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.083" offset="3747715">So I take it, your theory is if a member of the Union makes a complaint about one particular type of expenditure which he considers unlawful and improper that once the inquiry is made by the Secretary he can pursue every instance of improper expenditure that he encounters?</text>

            <text syncTime="936.647" offset="3850010">That’s perhaps the more difficult case.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.888" offset="3858892">Here at that challenge about the Secretary is limited to the 1967 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.160" offset="3879999">All of these officers were elected in the same 1967 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.457" offset="3901210">The validity of which have been questioned and it’s been questioned by the Secretary on the ground that an unlawful meeting-attendance requirement was impose as a condition for the candidacy qualification and this applied to all the candidates elected in that election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.820" offset="6650650">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.098" offset="6667786">The principal thrust of Mr. Wallace’s argument and it’s also the Government’s argument in the brief is a conception of this statute which I think is inconsistent with what Congress was thinking about when it enacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.185" offset="6720136">Over and over, we hear that the broader public interest is the correction of all violations of Title IV and there’s this little subsidiary thing over here about exhaustion of remedies which somehow crept into the statute and somehow the Secretary of Labor is stock with it and somehow it does indeed unfortunately limit his power to proceed in certain instances but because it’s such a little subsidiary thing then by all mean it should be so narrowly construed that it limits him only where the court has to say that it limits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.908" offset="6859003">Now, I would suggest that if one examines the legislative history of this statute that that does not accurately balance the two concerns that Congress had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.361" offset="6892857">To be sure Congress was concerned with what it had found in the McClellan Committee Hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.852" offset="6914800">There were it found and it is said a minority of Unions which had very undemocratic election procedures, the effect of which was that the incumbents were able to entrench themselves and the membership was not allowed to have voice in selecting its governors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.149" offset="6983973">And for that reason, Congress said and said it was doing it very reluctantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.733" offset="7002258">It imposed what is undoubtedly the most elaborate set of procedures and provisions and requirements governing the election of any non-public body in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.437" offset="7049070">But Congress realized in the sense the enormity of what it was doing it was making a quite unprecedented intrusion into the affairs of what have been thought to be private institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.377" offset="7092851">And so, throughout the debates and throughout the Senate Report which is really the principal explanation of Title IV is well been the concern of Congress that Union self government not be invaded anymore than it is absolutely necessary to accomplish this basic purposes for which the statute was being enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.283" offset="7172472">Congress repeatedly said this are private institutions the overwhelming majority of them are honestly and democratically run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.984" offset="7203297">It made a finding based on its hearings that Internal Union Appellate processes were in fact equipped to and had in fact dealt adequately with the since -- that had been committed within Unions with only a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.020" offset="7267453">And it modeled the statute which as it sought was going to balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.821" offset="7282604">On the one hand it’s concerned that where democracy was not existent that be a procedure to assure its existence and on the other a very critical concern in this stature that the Government not go trampling into the affairs of Unions anymore than was absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.592" offset="7361703">Now, to that end according to this statute, Section 402 (a), the exhaustion requirement and that perhaps I might begin as Mr. Wallace did with reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.785" offset="7402559">Section 402 (a) says, a member of a labor organization who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and by laws of statute organization not who has exhausted some remedies, not who has exhausted a remedy on one issue but who has exhausted the remedies available and we would suggest that if we are to resort to literalism and we do not think we should that that word available in there suggest rather strongly that what Congress was saying is you must give the Union all of the opportunities which it is affords you to bring these issues to it for correction in the first instance and when you have exhausted all of those remedies which are available within the Union then you may go on to the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.561" offset="7593566">And if it is found that the Union through the procedures that it provides has not adequately dealt with an allegation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.615" offset="7625853">Then in default of its correcting the problems, the Secretary of Labor may move in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.439" offset="7649155">There was no default in this case, the meeting-attendance rule which is the issue as to which we have this question was never raise within the Union and though there’s talk about well we can’t expect members to be able to draft complaints to the Union like lawyers would and we can’t expect them to be articulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.566" offset="7737657">That’s not the issue in this case, this isn’t a case where the failure to raise this issue was in artful draftsmanship or a lack of understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.681" offset="7774124">This is was candidate for the president who had himself qualified under the meeting-attendance rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.947" offset="7983208">None of them related to the other issue which the Secretary raised in this lawsuit which was the meeting-attendance rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.361" offset="8012779">He complained about the placement of the voting booths and some other things within the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.736" offset="8030333">The Union found those complaints without merit and so did the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.098" offset="8047783">But for our relevant purposes he did raise within the Union the complaint about his opponent using the mimeograph machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.102" offset="8075786">And as the Secretary conceded and answered to an interrogatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.770" offset="8090415">He did not raise within the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.154" offset="8100028">Any question as to the reasonableness of the meeting-attendance rule under which he had in fact qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.855" offset="8126777">Now, the Union heard those issues which he did raise and concluded that the election should not be set aside for any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.342" offset="8156766">He then filed a complaint to the Secretary which the Secretary construes as having raised the reasonableness of the meeting-attendance role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.976" offset="8191248">I think if you read it, it is not that clear that it raise that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.805" offset="8202637">What he was really complaining about was not the existence of the rule but the fact that he claimed and the court ultimately found to the contrary but he claimed that the rule had not been adequately communicated to the members so that they did not know that they were obligated to attend the meetings in order to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.527" offset="8273481">And prior to trial, we had interviewed the complainant and asked him whether he had intended to raise the reasonableness of the rule with the Secretary and he said, “No it’s a great rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.000" offset="8307336">I am all for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.386" offset="8312874">And at trial, we began to asked him questions says to whether he thought the rule was necessary for the well-being of the Union and the government objected and they said, “We don’t think the views of any one man are relevant to the resolution of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.456" offset="8361148">This is in the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.748" offset="8366373">And therefore we don’t think the court should allow the complaining witness to state whether he is or is not in agreement with this rule and the judge sustained that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.443" offset="8409109">So the record does not show the view of the complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.563" offset="8425618">I can only state that it was our expectation that had he been allowed to answer that question he would have said that a man cannot be an adequate officer of this Union unless he has attended the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.429" offset="8477132">So it’s doubtful to us that he even raised the question in his complaint to the Secretary, although the secretary claims that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.072" offset="8507643">But in any event raising it in the complaint to the Secretary is not sufficient compliance with the requirements of the statute because the statute quite clearly requires as we read it, that a member have exhausted it within the Union and I think this can be most easily demonstrated by examining the case which the Secretary admits that is if a member does not exhaust any issue within the Union then the Secretary concedes no matter how egregious that election, no matter how outrageous the violations of Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.117" offset="8635852">The Secretary may not institute a lawsuit to set that election aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.338" offset="8652675">He may indeed investigate and publish his condemnation of it but he may not institute a lawsuit to set it aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.146" offset="8811917">In other words, if there’s no complaint within the Union, a member simply goes directly to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.378" offset="8832920">If we understand the Secretary’s position, he is not claiming that by giving the Union notice before his sues that that’s an adequate substitute for exhaustion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.652" offset="8914004">But now says the Secretary, if there’s a complaint about something no matter irrelevant within the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.462" offset="8969174">Then says the Secretary, all of these egregious things that happened are now open to the correction of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.954" offset="8995192">Well, that seems very salutary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.381" offset="9000939">It’s always nice to have egregious violations corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.851" offset="9014732">But could it conceivably have been Congress’ intension to adopt so quick studied statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.840" offset="9038764">Why would Congress say that no matter how egregious the election unless a member exhaust within the Union, the Secretary can’t proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.559" offset="9069589">But if he exhaust about anything no matter how irrelevant, that exhaustion opens the door for the Secretary to come through and then correct all of these things which are otherwise not beyond his reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.470" offset="9117236">Just from a logical analysis, it wouldn’t make sense for Congress to make that kind of a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.227" offset="9140328">And if one looks indeed at what Congress thought was going to be served by the exhaustion requirement, it becomes clear that not only is it illogical but it’s not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.994" offset="9183378">Congress was as I stated earlier pre-occupied with its concern to foster Union self-government and as the Senate Report put it, to keep the Government’s hands off the Unions to the maximum extent consistent with the requirements of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.658" offset="9385984">In 19 -- this Bill was enacted in 1959 and it was the Kennedy Urban Bill which lead to Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.768" offset="9414405">In 1958 there was Bill called the Kennedy-Ives Bill, introduced and passed by the Senate but not by the House, and that Bill as passed by the Senate had exactly this language which appears in the final statute but because it was not passed by the House, it came up again in 1959 for reconsideration by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.892" offset="9498937">In 1959, several other proposed bills were also introduced in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.793" offset="9526523">One of which was introduced by Senator Mundt and that was Senate Bill number 1002 and that’s the one which the Government refers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.657" offset="9562049">Senator Mundt’s Bill was completely different from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.794" offset="9574588">It required no exhaustion of remedies within the Union at all but it prescribed some rules about how election would have to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.111" offset="9607816">And it said if 2% of the members of the Union are dissatisfied or think a violation has occurred they may, by signing a petition go to the Secretary of Labor alleging that a violation has occurred and the Secretary may then bring a lawsuit challenging such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.189" offset="9684093">Now that’s where that language came from that they cite as the competing Bill before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.059" offset="9707604">That Bill in fact never saw the light of day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.629" offset="9717844">It’s doubtful if anyone other than Senator Mundt ever read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.174" offset="9732054">At least when the floor debates on the Kennedy-Ervin Bill were going on, Senator Mundt said that his Bill had been given short shrift in the Committee and nobody had paid any attention to it and he was very regretful about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.928" offset="9779075">But the fact is that that Bill was never seriously before the Senate for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.855" offset="9798823">The language as it appears in it's final form had been adopted a year prior to that in 1958 was simply carried forward again in 1959 and readopted by the Senate without change in any of these salient points so that, I mean it does use the words “a violation” but I don’t think you can draw any inference that there was a conscious decision by Congress to use the words a violation rather than such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.947" offset="9903208">Since if Senator Mundt is to be believed, no one else ever even knew that his Bill and its words such violation was even before them for competing consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.620" offset="11029817">If you read the Senate Report I think you get more guidance in the ambiguity as a somewhat resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.991" offset="11055313">As we say -- as we read the Senate Report this -- the exhaustion requirement was intended to serve four functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.033" offset="11079555">Number one, Congress didn’t want the Secretary to be an agent at large bringing lawsuits wherever he thought Unions weren’t doing things right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.252" offset="11112364">This was a Union Democracy statute as Mr. Wallace said. Congress wanted to allow the Secretary to act where the member were dissatisfied with the way their Union was being run and if the members are not dissatisfied with the meeting-attendance rule, Congress didn’t want the Secretary trampling in challenging it absent their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.306" offset="11196583">Now, that purpose can’t be served at all if the Secretary is free that allege anything he wants to allege because as here he can then allege things as to which there’s no indication of membership dissatisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.018" offset="11243395">The second thing Congress wanted to serve by this is that it wanted to instill in the membership respect for Union for tribunals, and it wanted Union tribunals to function as administrative agencies notwithstanding the Government’s assertion to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.848" offset="11298774">This Court said that it was Congress’ emphatic intention that Unions would be the principal enforcement agencies of the statute and so Congress wanted members to see that their tribunals would indeed be available for the resolution of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.449" offset="11361155">Now, members are not going to be encouraged to take their disputes to the Union’s tribunals for resolution if they know that they can just throw any old thing into the Union and then go to the Secretary afterward and he’ll take it whether the Union have it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.102" offset="11419773">And indeed when Unions in fact they’re behaving in a responsible fashion as indeed the Steelworkers is in resolving election disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.805" offset="11454568">Is this Union over a period of 60 -- 1964 through 1967?</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.683" offset="11474108">It provided corrective action and the majority of the election complaints that came before it and so it was doing the job that Congress hope and expected Unions to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.538" offset="11509530">But if the members see that the Union tribunal is just willfully overruled by the Secretary who brings the lawsuits then I cannot be convinced that this Union is doing their job and they’re going to lose their motivation to bring the problems to the Union for correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.286" offset="11564492">Now, to be sure if the Union has fair notice of a problem and doesn’t do anything about it then it deserves to disrepute which its own internal proceedings are brought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.175" offset="11604093">But whereas here the Union has no notice whatsoever that an issue is being challenged and the reason it has no such notice is that indeed the issue is not being challenged by any of its member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.190" offset="11644113">It does nothing but bring the Union’s tribunal into disrepute for the membership to see that notwithstanding without the Union’s action the Secretary of Labor has then institute a lawsuit to set that election aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.796" offset="11698552">And finally, this statute was designed with very specific time limits in mind in the hopes that Union problems would be corrected very promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.120" offset="11731884">And what the Secretary’s construction means is that particular kinds of election problems can be raise for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.059" offset="11763649">Many months in this case it was four to five months after the elections been decided and long after all of the Union internal correction procedures had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.235" offset="11800325">The Senate Report said that it was putting the time limits into this statute because time as of the essence that’s their words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.043" offset="11827493">Time sees us to be at the essence when five months later the Secretary as a result of it's own views about what’s good and what’s bad in Union can raise for the first time issues which were never raise within the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.606" offset="13273840">And the basis of his attack is that well it's true that’s what my regulation says but from time to time I change my mind and indeed as the record on this case showed he changed that often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.436" offset="13317099">On the question whether and otherwise reasonable rule should be set aside because in fact only a very small percentage of the member choose to qualify themselves under it by attending the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.768" offset="13370493">Six months before this election was held, the Secretary stated he conducted a review and had determined that the small percentage should not invalidate the rule precisely because anybody could attend to one or two and if they chose not too that’s their own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.182" offset="13432142">After we held our election, he changed his mind again and decided to sue us.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.827" offset="13882702">The respondents reading of the statute seems to us perhaps to be appropriate one if the House version had been enacted giving the complainant the right to sue but it seems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.887" offset="13946964">We believe the most crucial decision in the legislative history was when Congress decide instead to bring the Secretary into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.114" offset="13979878">Under the respondents reading of this, the only possible effect of bringing the Secretary into the picture is that he may decide not to sue about something that the complainant would have sued about he cannot expand the scope of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.296" offset="14040586">And it seems to us that Congress brought the Secretary into the picture for exactly the opposite reason to expand the scope of the inquiry beyond the limited self-interest of the complainant, to look at the broader public purposes that involve in this statute in order to assure free and democratic elections for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.488" offset="14129298">Now, even look at narrowly it's true that this complainant as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out qualified himself but it was a close election for president and the result might well have been different if someone else have been able to run in addition, it might have taken away more votes from his opponent than from himself, as it happens in national elections.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3530.116" offset="14223862">I think and suppose it was made as this and here is a man who’s qualified under the rule that you’re attacking and it’s difficult for me to understand why he be complaining about a rule himself exactly?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3543.509" offset="14277360">Well, the District Courts reading of his complaint on page 44 of the records said that this what he complained about of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.102" offset="14303796">We think that was inaccurate reading and it may have been because he felt that with more candidates in the field he would have done better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.169" offset="14336084">There are people who are helping that and one of the governors will run for president on third party ticket this year because they think they will benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.352" offset="14368789">But self-interest is not what Congress wanted to promote under this statute and indeed in a very real sense since the Secretary’s policy is to sue only if in his view the members’ complain to the Union had validity in a very real sense, what we are asking for here is to enable the Secretary to consolidate the lawsuits that otherwise would have to be separately brought first to determine whether the election would be set aside and then to determine under what rules the new election would be held which would it seems to us intolerably delay the prompt remedy that Congress wanted to provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.150" offset="14667943">Now, I do want to point out before I sit down since a reference has been to the Secretary’s interpretive manual which is on page 203 of the appendix and it does say that 12 of -- that in an attendance requirement for 12 of 24 may be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.882" offset="14750908">This is not a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.502" offset="14757386">It was not published in the Federal Register.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.542" offset="14817573">It was not designed to be definitive interpretation of the statute and certainly the respondents have not relied on that provision because neither in that provision or in anything else as the Secretary ever said that a three-year requirement may be reasonable and it's a three-year requirement that’s involved here and is necessary implicated in the case on the rerun of the election even though the violations alleged was a violation for the application to 21 months to three-year requirement is what is to be applied on the rerun.</text>
