            <text syncTime="27.508" offset="213452">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.700" offset="230170">This is a habeas corpus proceeding which started in the United States District Court in Wyoming in November 1967 where petitioner’s claims were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.966" offset="267264">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the lower court’s decision was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.958" offset="291192">The pertinent history of the state court proceeding begins with Whiteley’s arrest in November 1964 and is being charged in two counts, breaking and entering and being an habitual criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.715" offset="342183">The petition was tried in Carbon County, Wyoming by a jury in May 1965 and convicted on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.746" offset="370395">He was sentenced one to 10 years on the first count and for life imprisonment on the second, both counts to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.905" offset="402996">Whiteley appealed this conviction to the Supreme Court of Wyoming which affirmed the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.504" offset="433403">In the United States District Court below when the party stipulated to try the case on both the record in the Trial Court in these original criminal proceedings number 2885 and on the record on appeal to the Supreme Court of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.187" offset="492126">The issue before this Court is whether probable cause existed for petitioner’s arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.200" offset="516159">If not, a surge incident to this arrest was illegal and invalid and the fruits thereof could not be used at his trial as they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.437" offset="621171">The next day, the sheriff of Carbon County acting on a tip from an unnamed and unidentified informant executed a complaint or affidavit on a basis of which an arrest warrant was sought and was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.439" offset="677177">With the Court’s permission, I would like to read the pertinent parts of this complaint since petitioner’s case in large part is based on a two alleged defects contained there in.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.420" offset="1329089">Contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided against the peace and dignity of the State of Wyoming, now that is the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.229" offset="1368273">Now, the warrant of arrest was issued and a statewide broadcast made to all law enforcement agencies on the basis of this arrest warrant and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.274" offset="1408502">That very night, petitioner was arrested by police officers of the City of Laramie which is the largest city in the adjoining county, Albany County and they arrested Whiteley with a Deputy Sheriff of Albany County.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.553" offset="1461582">And now we come to what I think is the crux of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.045" offset="1475584">This arrest was made solely on the basis of the statewide broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.251" offset="1492407">Neither the Laramie police nor the Albany County Deputy Sheriff had any reason to arrest Whiteley other than the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.708" offset="1522186">And the reason that this is so important is that these three courts below had previously passed on this very issue namely the Wyoming Supreme Court, the US District Court and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and each Court has made what I consider the same error that despite the fact that an arrest warrant had been used, the arrest was valid as a warrantless arrest on the ground that the arresting officers had probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.095" offset="1619780">And they find this probable cause because they were told by another law enforcement agency to arrest them.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.915" offset="1647052">Now, I think this must be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.920" offset="1663039">The arresting officers had no independent knowledge of any facts concerning the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.188" offset="1688116">Therefore, I submit that the key question before this Court is not whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest warrant may still be valid if efficient probable cause exists to support a warrantless arrest rather, the crucial issue here is whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest warrant and without any independent ground on the part of the arresting officer to support a warantless arrest is valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.357" offset="1984763">But I know the lower courts in this country have held that if the arrest warrant is invalid but there still remains probable cause for a warrantless arrest, that is good.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.856" offset="4326797">I like to direct myself to several questions that the court has raised before I go in to discussion, my aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.984" offset="4355323">I might add that my good friend, the counsel here and I, he at the law school and I in the Attorney General’s office have been fighting this for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.187" offset="4388133">We started with it at that first Federal Court level and have taken a right through and we’ve lost issues along the way and now we’re done with the real knob.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.795" offset="4426585">And we do have a great familiar work, familiar hierarchy with this case as this Court obviously by its questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.391" offset="4452916">But I would like to spend a moment on Justice Blackmun’s question because I think you put your finger right on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.006" offset="4487398">We have consistently argued from all levels of the Court that we could care less about that arrest warrant that is quite immaterial to our proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.000" offset="4523342">That we’re talking about whether or not there was probable cause to make the arrest and or the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.594" offset="4545703">The Judge Kerr, the Federal District Judge, brought the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.874" offset="4562840">The Tenth Circuit Judge Hecky writing the opinion about the argument and now we’re here at this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.584" offset="4581752">And Justice Blackmun, this is the key question as far as the state is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.564" offset="4601605">Whether or not there was probable cause, we think it’s quite immaterial whether or not there was effective arrest warrant and we go one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.005" offset="4631385">I think you again diagnosed the case right on point when you say there were two complaints and arrest warrant’s issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.410" offset="4665031">One for the burglary of the rustic bar and the other which she was actually tried on the arrest of the hardware store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.388" offset="4700975">Now, in Wyoming we currently have adopted the criminal rules of procedures which are patterned after the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.219" offset="4728247">But at this time in Wyoming we were operating under some old statutes that are not unique or different throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.111" offset="4755832">There quite somewhere to many other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.784" offset="4762520">And it’s simply this that a complaint is filed usually by a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.839" offset="4786761">Based upon that complaint and arrest and or search warrant is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.182" offset="4804106">The arrest is made, an information is filed which is in lieu of the grand jury hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.471" offset="4825213">At a preliminary hearing probable cause is determined and the sequence is immediately whipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.255" offset="4848410">Whiteley was arrested on the 24th of that evening. the next morning the arrest warrant and the criminal complaint were filed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.121" offset="4883832">The information was filed and a preliminary hearing held before a magistrate in Rawlins, Wyoming determined whether or not there was probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.041" offset="10727528">There is absolutely nothing in the record to show that anything except that there was a tip, there’s nothing in the record to show that the tipster told Ogburn that he saw that he recognized a man with a tattoo on his arm and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.319" offset="10792626">All we have is that the tipster told him, Whiteley did it, and I submit to the Court in the absence of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.548" offset="10817599">The absence of this on the record, I think we must make the assumption that then Ogburn said, “well I know, I know Whiteley well, he is six feet tall, he’s 47 years old,” etcetera, etcetera, and he put this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.472" offset="10869217">Now I say I’m making an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.354" offset="10876740">But I think the other assumption is equally bad to say that the tipster gave them this information about Whiteley.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.572" offset="11541608">If I had been the county attorney then I would have certainly proven that there was a reliable informant etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.522" offset="11565432">I would like to say just on this Draper question that I have set it forth in my reply brief but two things about Draper: One, Draper was a reliable informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.825" offset="11606706">We had a reliable informant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.144" offset="11611930">We do not have that here and I think for that reason Draper falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.211" offset="11628231">Secondly, in the Spinelli case, Mr. Justice Harlan says and I’m quoting from page 11 that it is especially important that the tip described the accused criminal activity insufficient detail so the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulated in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual’s general reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.389" offset="11712972">I really think we have got a reputation case here because everybody in Wyoming knew that Whiteley was -- had four, five convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.094" offset="11739721">And I think what’s done him in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.297" offset="11776606">I’m sure somebody told the sheriff, maybe Whiteley was in Saratoga.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.896" offset="11790921">I think that would be enough in Saratoga, small town of 2000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.417" offset="11805027">If a burglary occurred, Whiteley was there, that might be planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.000" offset="11827388">In fact, I don’t know but I would assume that’s just what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.359" offset="11840763">And then Ogburn went back and said let’s see, Whiteley is six feet tall, has a tattoo on his left arm, graying hair etcetera, etcetera and he put this out on the radio broadcast.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.879" offset="11922892">One final point, we stipulated to the record in this case at the lower court, admittedly there were other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.619" offset="11957896">This question always was in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.714" offset="11974196">We had questions of exhaustion of state remedies and so on and Judge Kerr was more interested in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.635" offset="11997915">But this question was in the case and he adopted the Wyoming Supreme Court attitude or decision on it and so the defense circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.367" offset="12036890">But if this Court should feel that a reversal is proper, I do not think it should be sent back to the District Court to have another hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.055" offset="12075551">We had our opportunity to have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.227" offset="12084328">We stipulated to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.693" offset="12094151">Whiteley has been in jail since November 24, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.526" offset="12113481">I think that he should have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.174" offset="12124035">And in 1965 at the trial or in a motion to dismiss -- motion to suppress and I don’t think we should send this back when a man’s liberty has been handled this way over this many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.189" offset="12252139">As far as I know the only evidence he has is the other goods, the fruits that he found in the car and Daley’s testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.677" offset="12366033">Ordinarily, I think the form is it goes, this is federal habeas it goes back to the District Court with the instructions of the District Court to give the state a reasonable opportunity 30, 60 days whatever it is to bring and give him a new trial or else to release him.</text>
