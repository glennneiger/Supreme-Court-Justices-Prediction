          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="7.292" stopTime="926.522">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="7.292" offset="135649">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.223" offset="147352">If it please the Court, I would like to take a somewhat indirect approach now to the statutory issue that I began to discuss yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="200955">And while this may seem a bit roundabout, I believe it will serve to help to clarify our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.258" offset="243482">And I'd like to start by reminding the Court of the terms of the statutory provision of the 1866 Act that was before it two terms ago, in Jones against Mayer &amp; Company, it's now Section 1982 of Title 42 which reads "all citizens of the United States shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell hold and convey real and personal property" and a similar provision of the 1866 Act with respect entering into contracts and to suing and beast in being sued is now in Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.708" offset="469285">There is in the complaint to the present case, an allegation that's rather similar in its terms, at least in what we deem to be a crucial term and that is on page 6 of the appendix in paragraph 12, where there's an allegation that by this conspiracy, the defendants have willfully and maliciously intimidated and prevented the plaintiffs from enjoying and exercising, going down to the bottom of this paragraph, their rights to travel the public highways without restrained in the same terms as white citizens in Kemper County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.453" offset="708253">And I believe this similarity has some relevance because of the threat of continuity that runs through the adoption of all three of these amendments to the Constitution and through the whole serious of legislations through the 1866, 1870, and 1871 Acts and even the 1875 Act which is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.565" offset="812743">The overriding purpose behind all of these provisions and it colors the way they should be read and interpreted as this Court has said many times, was to achieve a meaningful emancipation for the former slaves in various aspects of community life.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.106" offset="906888">This was certainly a purpose to be achieved in 1870 legislation and when Congress was made aware that the activities of the Ku Klux Klan and other private conspirators were interfering with the achievements of this objective, Congress went on in 1871 to enact the legislation that’s now before us and that this Court is to asked to interpret in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.394" offset="1048054">The first section of that legislation is now Section 1983 of Title 42 and that is quoted on page 10 of our brief, our grey covered brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.029" offset="1142512">That provided that every person who under color of any statute or ordinance, regulation, customer usage of any state or territory, under color of law, subjects or causes to be subjected, any citizens of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws is liable to a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.403" offset="1292037">Now that covered liability by public officials who acting under color of law have deprived complainants of rights including -- of rights under fourth -- under the Constitution including Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.978" offset="1362359">This Court has several times held that the statues applies to Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well to other rights in Screws against United States, Monroe against Pape, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.495" offset="1424426">That was not, as this Court noted last term in its opinion in Hedequist against Crest Co, that was not the most controversial provision of 1871 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.576" offset="1488792">It was Section 2 in which Congress went on to reach at least in terms, actions that are not taken under color of law that provoked the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.005" offset="1554516">And before proceeding to Section 2, I want to say one other thing about the Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.837" offset="1577817">Not only did it reach actions by public officials and make them subject to suit for damages, it also extended, it has been held a number of times to actions by private persons taken in concert with public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.089" offset="1658796">Those two are actions taken under color of law as this Court held with respect to the comparable criminal provision in the United States against Price, and a number of Court Of Appeals cases have held the same thing with respect to 1983 and a footnote in the Price opinion indicates that this is an accurate analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.150" offset="1763077">So, with this in mind as what was accomplished in Section 1 of the legislation, I think we can turn to an analysis of what did Section 2 of the same law add.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.813" offset="1837683">Now, Section 2 is insofar as we're concern with it, the civil part of Section 2 is now the provision before us, Section 1985 (3) of Title 42, it's set forth in full on page 2 of our brief, but I think for purposes of our discussion, it will be more convenient to refer to the page 7 of our brief in which we have quoted from the Collins opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.114" offset="1978849">This Court's adumbration of the various provisions with numbering added to it that are covered in 1985 (3) and here is where the Congress gave attention to activities of private conspirators and attempted to provide redress in order to, as I said the outset, achieve the meaningful emancipation that was the overriding objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.144" offset="2127015">One of the things that the Congress provided redress for where conspiracies by two or more persons in the part number 2 here on page 7 to prevent or hinder the constituted authorities from giving or securing to all persons, the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.034" offset="2226594">Interference with public officials, even though it not be conspiratorial, not be taken on concert, that is conspiratorial with the public officials, even though it not be taken in concert with the public officials, interference with there providing of equal protection is covered by that part of 1985 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="552.891" offset="2318023">Interference in concert is already covered in Section 1 of the Act as I said and then the part numbered 3 and 4 provides specific protections against conspiracies, to interfere with voting in federal elections and campaigning in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.407" offset="2412063">Now, the question remaining and the key question in this case is what does the first part add to these provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.570" offset="2464726">What further meaning is there in the first part of 1985 (3) are approach to any statue as that each part must mean something and not be merely redundant of what is enacted right along with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="610.436" offset="2548214">How can two or more private persons conspire without in someway acting under the color of law or in concert with public officials so as to deprive any person or class persons of equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="635.160" offset="2647061">They don't have the authority to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.990" offset="2658450">That is the conceptual difficulty with trying to attribute a meaning to this part of the statute that goes beyond what Congress had already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.028" offset="2718532">In some ways, it's very similar to the difficulty that three justices of the court in Screws against the United States and Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Monroe against Pape had with the question of how can a state officials, acting contrary to state law, be depriving an individual of rights that the states guarantees him?</text>
            <text syncTime="681.700" offset="2833262">It's a rather similar conceptual difficulty, and indeed, the answer which this Court gave in the Collins opinion is very similar to the answer to that other question which was given in the dissenting opinion in Screws against United States and in the dissenting opinion Monroe against Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.259" offset="2935453">The answer, the key language of the answer can be found on page 8 of our brief, the very next page.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.578" offset="2980801">In the middle of the page in the paragraph set forth on the middle page, the second sentence of that paragraph points out that the negative answer of the Collins opinion said that unless the law or it's agencies were to give sanction or sanctuary to private conduct, the victims rights, this is quoting from Collins, the victims rights under the laws and to protection of the laws remain untouched and equal to the rights of every other person within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.424" offset="3148089">And that is why the Collins opinion in effect reads this part of 1985 (3) as merely redundant of 1983, is really accomplishing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.765" offset="3217471">But if we look back at the language of the statute again, the statute doesn't say that the wrong as to deprive someone as Collins said of the rights to equal protection under the laws, that's not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.869" offset="3301898">The statutes says “Conspiracy to deprive them of equal protection of the reality; not the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="806.176" offset="3331156">As Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in his opinion in Hedequist , the only way to deprive someone of the right to equal protection of the laws will be to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.167" offset="3383087">That couldn't be what Congress had in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.442" offset="3392178">No private persons could accomplish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.736" offset="3437422">So the question in our mind becomes what it that private persons conspiring together can do that would deprive someone of the meaningful enjoyment of these guarantees that the Constitution had added as against the states, besides interfering with the conduct of public officials which covered in the second part here.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.597" offset="3564795">What is it besides that that private persons can do that would interfere with the enjoyment of these rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="873.154" offset="3599067">Well, one fairly obvious thing to refer to a problem that is again before this Court is term would be, if there were a school desegregation order and private persons conspire together to prevent children because of their race from attending a particular school, intercepted them and prevented them from getting there.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.083" offset="3738770">That would not be action taken under color of law, it would not be action taken in concert with public officials, and it seems to us that it would be a deprivation of enjoyment of the right to equal protection of the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.659" offset="4089125">Well, in response to your question, but it seems to me, it would still be within the coverage of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.674" offset="4125174">The concern of Congress was with the possibility that the rights would not be enjoyed because private persons would prevent their enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.185" offset="4175224">As matter of fact, there is very specific referenced to this in a legislative history of the amendment adding the word equal which Mr. Pollak spoke about yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.088" offset="4234783">I'd like to refer the Court to that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.742" offset="4249412">These are the remarks by Representative Garfield, later, the President of the United States in support of this amendment and in support of the provision that then was enacted as a consequence of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.571" offset="4316703">And this appears -- this is not quoted in a briefs unfortunately, it appears on page 153 of the congressional globe for the 42nd Congress, first session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.633" offset="4376994">These remarks incidentally were cited, although this particular one’s were not quoted in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in Hedequist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.082" offset="4422760">Mr. Garfield, Representative Garfield said there in support of the amendment and I quote now, "to state the case is the most moderate terms, it appears that some of the southern states, there exists a wide spread secret organization whose members are bound together by solemn oath to prevent certain classes of citizens, certain classes of citizens of the United States from enjoying their new rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.363" offset="4559851">These new rights conferred upon them by the Constitution and laws and they are putting into execution their design of preventing such citizens from enjoying the free right of the ballot box and other privileges and immunities of citizens and from enjoying the equal protection of the laws."</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1152.127" offset="4714914">Well, we argue in our brief that as applied here, the Thirteenth Amendment is applicable to this application, and that the Fourteenth Amendment, the enforcement provision of both of those amendments, it would be the relevant provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.516" offset="4788475">If I may Mr. Justice, I'd like get to that in just moment after I finish this statutory analysis and it's applicability to this case as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.075" offset="4834764">Given that much meaning of the statue, we say that even that applies here because the allegation is of a terroristic, coercive interference with the use of public highways, that is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.659" offset="4921072">In fact, it's not terribly different from some of the activities of the Klan during the period in which Congress was enacting this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.246" offset="4967466">We think really that the right should probably be formulated in more basic terms than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.974" offset="5010307">We don't think it would really make a difference in this case if the interception had occurred on a private driveway rather than on the public road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.301" offset="5055655">As this Court noted Jones against Mayer Co., one of the rights that Congress was concerned to accomplished through the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1866 legislation and we say there is threat of continuity running through here was to see to it that the newly emancipated Negroes would have, in Senator Trumble's words that were – and they are quoted, "freedom to go and come at pleasure."</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.947" offset="5198284">And certainly, the kind of freedom to go and come for this class of persons that would be upheld for white persons, for the ordinary persons in the community is of the essence of a accomplishing a meaningful emancipation, changing people's status from a subjugated status to a free status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.792" offset="5305595">And this why it seems to us that what Congress was trying to do was to protect persons from private conspiracies directed against them because of their membership in a class, because of their race or other comparable membership in a class directed toward keeping them in an inferior status, preventing them from enjoying these rights in the public sectors, as we say in our brief, that others in the community have the right under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments against the state to enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.220" offset="5467345">Now, it seems to us that the Court’s opinion in Jones, practically points the way to the application of the Thirteenth Amendment to sustain the statute to get back to Mr. Justice Harlan’s question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.274" offset="8267567">It is alleged that on July 2, 1966 which happened to be a Sunday afternoon, the claimants in this cause were traveling down a public road and they were intercepted by the respondents in this cause and the confrontations occurred, whereby this alleged that an assault was made and some physical damages down to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.784" offset="8433601">And as a result from that, the petitioners filed their suit in the state court of Kemper County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.087" offset="8482816">That case is still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.380" offset="8487936">It hasn't been tried, but anyways on the dockets still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.636" offset="8513014">They also filed a complaint in the Eastern Division of the Southern Districts of Mississippi federal jurisdiction, and the cause came on to be heard upon the motion of the respondents to dismiss the case because the declaration had wholly failed to state a cause of action in that did not allege an action under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.484" offset="8684377">The decision of the district judge was appealed to the Fifth Circuit of the fifth district and the circuit court affirmed the ruling of the district judge, holding that there had been no action to alleged damages committed under the color of law, and then the case was appealed to this body and we here today for that.</text>
