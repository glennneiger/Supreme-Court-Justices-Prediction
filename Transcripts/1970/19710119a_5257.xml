            <text syncTime="78.325" offset="416684">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think this is the crux and the real issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.919" offset="439045">It’s not a question of whether or not of a state as was so aptly put in Justice Harlan’s dissent in the Levy and Glona cases has the right to require a formal burden of proof standards or criteria which are meaningful and relevant in determining the question of the state's application of its laws but in this case, no matter what burden of proof is met by this particular child, because of the fact that the child is saddled with the stigma of illegitimacy, this child can inherit nothing and in fact as what in effect is a different standard of requesting support from the decedent’s state.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.610" offset="617827">This particular child had much better proof of her relationship to the decedent Ezra Vincent than did the brothers and sisters of the decedent who came from Washington DC and other far away places to claim the decedent’s estate and were granted the decedent’s estate by all of the Louisiana Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.827" offset="698702">These brothers and sisters could produce no marriage license to show that their parents were married. They could produce no birth certificates to show they were children of the same parent as the decedent Ezra Vincent.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.207" offset="744155">Their reputation proof was extremely sketchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.772" offset="758471">None of the witnesses other than family members, the brothers and sisters themselves could recite the names of the brothers and sisters of the decedent and yet the Louisiana Courts because of its faulty burden of proof situation and because of its traditional prejudice against illegitimates rather awarded the estate to the brothers and sisters than to the little child.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.141" offset="2619956">Under various conditions, this is at page 12 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.869" offset="2634898">For example in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, and I do know Your Honor that North Dakota has changed this law as a result of the in re estate of Jensen case which would make a fifth or sixth state in which this particular case would not – needs have arisen before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.918" offset="2711071">In re estate of Jensen, in the state of North Dakota after the Levy and Glona cases, the North Dakota Supreme Court rightly applied Levy and Glona to an inheritance case and said that the North Dakota statute was an unconstitutional discrimination against illegitimates and allowed an illegitimate to inherit.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.595" offset="2805739">Not only did this illegitimate child not inherit her father's estate but the Louisiana Courts felt that because she was receiving a $100.00 per month in social security and VA benefits that she was not entitled to support because of the standard which the statute establishes for support for an illegitimate which is to prove actual necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.053" offset="2895600">This is a heavier standard and a recognized child has to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.584" offset="2921723">The child’s needs were shown to be a $192.30 per month, but because of the fact that she is illegitimate, she must continue to live in a condition of destitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.341" offset="2976684">As we view it Your Honors, the real issue in this case is the denial of inheritance rights to illegitimates, promote a genuine state interest in family unity and if it does so promote it, can this be promoted in a haphazard fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.935" offset="3071143">We would concede that family unity is something that is very much of concern to states and something which to be well promoted for instance, the state of Louisiana could well legislate a bonus for parents who remained together and care for their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.281" offset="3148466">To the contrary, the state of Louisiana has passed a statute legislating against parents who stay together for welfare purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.210" offset="3188172">If parents remained together and they have dependent childrenintestate succession laws, in their destitute, they’re ineligible in the State of Louisiana for welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.804" offset="3222549">This appears in Louisiana revised statutes 46:231.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.642" offset="3245955">Therefore, Louisiana certainly pursuing the most peculiar course if it’s genuinely trying to promote family unity in the field of legitimate relationships between parents and children.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.258" offset="3352430">By the same token, some states in applying this type of statute have tried to go further against illegitimates by invoking the substitute father doctrine which is that if there were an illegitimate father in a household, he would be presumed to be the parent of all of the children therein and therefore that illegitimacy situation would exclude all of the children from benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.969" offset="3455248">Now, this Court had no trouble with that type of statute in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.787" offset="3470503">In Smith versus King, this Court struck this down as a denial of Equal Protection of law and Due Process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.070" offset="3507702">Furthermore, if the State of Louisiana is to be consistent in pursuing the doctrine of family unity and promoting legitimacy, they should -- we feel, pay some attention to the recent statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.339" offset="3564753">According to the trends in illegitimacy in the United States 1940 to 1965 which was published by the National Center for Health Statistics in February of 1968, Louisiana had more illegitimate births per capita in states which did not follow this particular and repressive approach to illegitimacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.464" offset="8049246">And my comment on the facts of this case, in the Levy case, Justice Douglas stated that the Court assumed that the minor children there had a family relationship with their mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.823" offset="8098670">That is the mother supported them, that’s is where the illegitimate children sought under Louisiana wrongful death statute to recover damages for the death of their natural mother, that there was a family relationship, the mother supported them, she took them to church, she took them to school, she cared for them, she lived with them but there’s none of those facts are in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.018" offset="8183411">This case shows -- does not show that Ezra lived with the child</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.657" offset="8205981">.In fact, the evidence is just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.107" offset="8223848">If you’ll notice the acknowledgment papers and the birth certificate, it’ll show that the address of the mother was something on Belton Street in Lake Charles Louisiana, whereas Ezra and his family lived in a little town called Moss Ville which is 10 -- across 10 or 12 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.105" offset="8299813">Now, the fact that there was no marriage certificate between Ezra’s father and mother is due to the fact that there were no marriage records in (Inaudible) parish where this man lived prior to 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.766" offset="8354461">And his brothers and sisters all were born prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.833" offset="8370657">So there’s no marriage records nor were there any birth certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.217" offset="8384240">So, we had to prove the marriage relationship of Ezra’s mother and father by their reputation in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.900" offset="8414960">And in so doing, we found out that this interest in this property that Ezra Vincent left was real property, he had eight brothers and sisters -- seven brothers and sisters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.117" offset="8451845">1/8th of it constituted the bulk of this succession which amounted to proximate $15,000.00, that was a family home and Ezra and his brothers and sisters lived there, they formed the property, they went to the Baptist church together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.478" offset="8517256">His grandfather was a Baptist minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.036" offset="8535542">Their reputation in the community was such as to be the highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.377" offset="8552887">They were recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.561" offset="8557589">His family was recognized as prominent citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.410" offset="8568978">So there was a family relationship between Ezra, his brothers and sisters and their parents, whereas, this was not shown to be the case by the evidence as presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.660" offset="8626030">Now, in common law, an illegitimate was known as a non-person, he was not entitled to inherit anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.288" offset="8672528">Louisiana law as I have stated permits them to inherit but not as high upon the ladder as legitimate relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.195" offset="8716204">The civil law has historically treated illegitimates more favorable than illegitimates by letting them inherit from their mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.249" offset="8760404">The most modern statutes now permit illegitimate children to inherit from their mother but prohibit or deny them to inherit from their father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.860" offset="8802826">Now we get down, we’ve been talking about the child in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.803" offset="8818604">I think the Court should also give some consideration to the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.198" offset="8836159">Now, when he died, the laws of the State of Louisiana, the intestate laws were -- was that his property, his family property would be inherited by his brothers and sisters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.874" offset="8886836">Now, at that time, Ezra had a choice to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.086" offset="8899688">He could say now look, I want to leave this child something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.711" offset="8914213">I want to make a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.380" offset="8920900">He could have done that or he could have said I want to marry the mother of the child, there was no impediment to the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.494" offset="8953396">Or he could have adopted the child. Anyone of those things would have changed the course of these events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.139" offset="8979937">Now once Ezra died, he no longer can exercise any choice when die was cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.842" offset="9014732">This Court cannot revert this case back to before his death and say now, Ezra, you have the choice, what do you want to do because what he did indicates what his choice was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.475" offset="13181262">Mr. Cox, you have three minutes left, I think I’ll hold my question until you finish so as not to use your time for you.</text>

            <label>Mr. James J. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3278.853" offset="13218774">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.539" offset="13229537">I think that at the outset I should answer the most important question raised by Mr. Leithead and that was the question of the confusion that would result in property law if this illegitimate child were considered to be a child of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.022" offset="13295470">The answer is that if this Court ruled that as it has in Levy and Glona that is invidious to discriminate against an illegitimate and that this child should be treated as a legitimate since the burden of proof standard has been met here, then this child would simply inherit like any other child and his relationship vis-à-vis the parents vis-à-vis collateral candid would be just like any other child, there would no uncertainty in Louisiana’s property laws result of such a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.476" offset="13425246">It was cleared up in North Dakota by the North Dakota Supreme Court by stating that for all extents and purposes, a child who has the burden of proving his parentage shall be treated as though legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.995" offset="13491388">Now, I think that the other question that is the chaos that might be created in land titles.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.121" offset="13511868">On what ground did North Dakota based that holding?</text>

          <turn speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="3355.293" stopTime="3498.025">
            <label>Mr. James J. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3355.293" offset="13524511">Oh, the Court of North Dakota and in re estate of Jensen, based it on the grounds of the North Dakota constitution and the United States constitution granting Equal Protection of laws to all of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.370" offset="13576861">It’s not strictly relevant but the Supreme Court of that state of Italy under its post war constitution, some 10 or 15 days ago according to an AP dispatch, decided that in Italy, the equal protection of the laws under the post war constitution demanded that a child who bore the burden of proving within a narrow framework, his relationship to his parent could inherit just like a legitimate child and this is the only issue this before this Court, not some sort of disruption of the orderly legal processes of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.114" offset="13715832">Simply, the granting of equal protection of the laws within a narrow framework, to children who have nothing to say except through this Court about their status, the innocent victims of discrimination, Levy and Glona are the laws of the land and to repudiate Levy and Glona because of the fact that land titles might be involved is to deny to a particular person or a particular case or controversy, equal justice under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.145" offset="13835995">Now, in the famous case of Moscrat versus United States, it was held that actual cases are controversies with the things that were presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.751" offset="13870373">Declaratory judgments about other people’s rights would not be entered upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.444" offset="13893151">n US versus Wade and Gilbert versus California, the Court ruled that the new standards which were basic standards of Due Process and those cases, that is the right of an accused to have an counsel in a lineup where this – lead to prejudice to this case, would be applied to Wade and Gilbert but not to those who had lived before Wade and Gilbert or who had transgressed previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.497" offset="14001403">If this Court rules in favor of the little child in this case, it would apply to her case and to subsequent cases and lawyers will have ample opportunity to make their wills and provide under the laws for their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.325" offset="14060648">But under Levy and Glona, this child is entitled to the most profound consideration of her equal protection rights by this honorable court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.025" offset="14095444">Mr. Cox, I live in Virginia which permits a testator to make a will, I think anyway he wants to do it, he cut off his children, I suppose that’s true in 49 of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.463" offset="14153226">Suppose, I make the will, leaving nothing to my children, do they have a claim that because Louisiana, if they lived in Louisiana, I could not have cut them off but they are thereby denied Equal Protection?</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.875" offset="14222921">No because, here we have a question of class, a class of people Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.037" offset="14247476">In this particular case we have a class of people illegitimates just like a class of people, Chinese in which this honorable court in cases has said that in an alien land loss cases, said we couldn’t discriminate against Japanese.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.519" offset="14357400">I see no reason why children in one state should not be able to inherit and children in another state according to the state’s legislative wisdom can inherit only if their parents say they can or cannot, but I do see something invidious in one state saying that under -- or any state saying that a -- that Japanese as was this case in Oyama versus California, that the child of an alien cannot hold property because it’s presumed to be the alien’s property and I would join with Justice Black who wanted to go further and say that not only could that child hold property but his parents should be able to hold property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.661" offset="14514030">This is a discrimination against the class of children Your Honor, not a state trying to carry out a state purpose.</text>
