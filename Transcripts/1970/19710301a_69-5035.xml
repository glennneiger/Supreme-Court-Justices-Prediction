            <text syncTime="30.914" offset="228059">This is an appealable Louisiana Supreme Court decision which affirmed appellant's conviction and sentenced for the crime of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.994" offset="272363">Two issues considered by the Court below and before this Court for review involve the question of jury, the question of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.099" offset="320742">Specifically with regard to the jury question, there are two aspects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.664" offset="339028">Does the Louisiana jury system which provides for a non-unanimous verdict in serious felony cases clash with the Equal Protection Clause because it denies the benefit of unanimity to appellant, while extending it to those charged and tried for greater and lesser crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.438" offset="434113">The second aspect of the jury question concerns whether, in light of Winship, the majority verdict is constitutionally permissible in that appellant has not been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="98.439" offset="498166">Mr. Buckley, how old is the Louisiana system?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.084" offset="512690">Is it an ancient one?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="103.865" offset="519899">It began in 1898 when Louisiana revised its Constitution and, as you know, grandfather clause and other provisions were made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.297" offset="573607">The other issue that was considered below and here before this Court is whether appellant's lineup identification which the appellant contends was a direct result of an unlawful arrest was inadmissible and should have been excluded from the trial of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.942" offset="648213">The Court below, in response to the two issues considered, deferred to this Court on the question concerning the jury, although they did held that their system was fair and gave fairness to appellant's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.444" offset="722192">And in regards to the lineup identification, the Louisiana Supreme Court found a lawful arrest based upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.476" offset="762316">The relevant facts pertaining to the two issues are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.435" offset="786139">Appellant, a Black citizen, was seized in his home before daybreak by six armed New Orleans detectives with shotguns who had entered his home without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.590" offset="838802">A general search was conducted of all the rooms, no evidence connecting the appellant with the crime was found therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.138" offset="872970">Subsequent to some interrogation, appellant was booked about four hours after the initial entering of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.778" offset="903481">A few days later, appellant was part of a general lineup consisting of armed robbery suspects and armed robbery victims, and he was identified by a person who had been a victim of an armed robbery about four weeks previous to appellant's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.400" offset="986028">I made mention that this was not the same person for whom appellant was booked for armed robbery initially at his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.925" offset="1024063">The lineup identification was subsequently used at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.790" offset="1039527">In fact, the identification formed the primary basis of the evidence against appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.475" offset="1066277">Pretrial motions and hearings were held on the arrest and detention of appellant, and they were denied by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.608" offset="1110789">Appellant was tried on May 15, 1968 for armed robbery, a crime punishable in Louisiana for not less than 5 or more than 99 years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.748" offset="1191351">The jury of 12 returned a verdict of 9 for guilty and 3 for not guilty which constitutes in Louisiana a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.152" offset="1237013">Appellant was sentenced subsequently to 35 years of hard labor and is presently serving the 35 years in Angola, Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.124" offset="1388941">Louisiana conducts separate pretrial and the trial itself, pretrial hearings concerning the arrest, detention etc took place earlier, and over a span of three days they were out without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.757" offset="1459472">In regard to the issue of whether the non-unanimous verdict is a denial of Equal Protection, I briefly mentioned the Louisiana jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.427" offset="1498133">Louisiana provides that in Capital cases, it'd be a jury consisting of 12 of which all must concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.194" offset="1533137">In crimes that could be punishable by hard labor, the jury consists of 12 of which only 9 have to concur in the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.299" offset="1573575">In crimes which may be punishable by hard labor, the jury consists of 5 jurors, of which all must concur in the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.151" offset="1621013">Louisiana asserts the reason, and this has also been explained in some judicial decisions of Louisiana, but in their brief, they indicate the reason for this difference in the classification between the different crimes and the way they're tried is to reduce cost and expedite matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.809" offset="1703664">We contend that this is not a rational basis for Louisiana to extend unanimity to some and deny to the appellant.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.852" offset="1879834">It works down the line concerning the benefit of unanimity and the function it plays in the jury trial, Your Honor, which I can show.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.773" offset="1911495">To give you an example of how it works up the line is that, as you know, in most jurisdictions Louisiana won, in a Capital case, the jury can return a recommendation that the punishment be without the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.748" offset="1975338">In Louisiana, an individual that the jury does return that recommendation to is eligible for parole and pardoned within 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.300" offset="2025597">And, asI indicated earlier, an individual in the armed -- convicted of armed robbery, as appellant was, does not have the benefit of parole or probation or suspension of sentence and must serve the entire time and the verdict could be until 99 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.003" offset="3284386">Another aspect with regard to the Equal Protection argument is that Kalven &amp; Zeisel, the American Jury had given some evidence that in crimes or trials where the verdict has to be unanimous, there are hung juries about 5% of the time, whereas in non-unanimous jury verdict type cases a hung jury results about half that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.774" offset="3407475">Taking that statistic and comparing it to what happens to the hung juries in the unanimous situations and those which, in Louisiana, permits convictions, it indicates, as expressed in our brief, that there'll be a result about 44% convictions in Louisiana and about 12% acquittals if you use the statistics that Kalven has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.195" offset="4369199">Thus, instead of shared responsibility of a jury's guilt determination process, we have a split or divided responsibility.</text>

            <label>Ms. Louise Korns</label>
            <text syncTime="1929.743" offset="7823318">Certainly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.112" offset="7832827">To begin with on the jury question, the first question in the case, just to touch briefly on the historical background of a majority jury verdict system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.559" offset="7878593">As this Court knows, various theories have been advanced to explain why unanimous jury verdicts became required in many jurisdictions, particularly in England, up until 1967 between the 18th Century, about 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.620" offset="7958841">And, Chief -- Lord Justice Devlin, I think most writers concede that Lord Justice Devlin's theory that it was purely by chance is the correct theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.451" offset="7994159">As Lord Justice Devlin and I think Professor Fayer (ph) also in the Harvard Law Review point out, during the middle ages in England, a trial by compurgation there was the custom of a party having to have his oaths -- his version of the facts supported by the oath of 12 jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.076" offset="8072735">So, they would assemble 12 compurgators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.036" offset="8084543">If these 12 compurgators couldn't support the oath of the party, they'd keep adding to him and adding to him until, finally, out of who knows how many number, 100, they had 12 men swearing to the position of one party, and then he won the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.507" offset="8142430">Just to skip briefly over, it is the function of the jury ran in the 12th Century gradually changed to judging credibility rather than swearing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.097" offset="8184748">The practice of adding extra jurors was eliminated, but the requirement that the crown obtained 12 votes to convict was kept and, therefore, as Mr. Justice Devlin points out, the unanimity requirement grew out of a majority system of jury verdicts in which at least 12 votes were needed to support a verdict out of an untold number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.597" offset="8294776">Now at the present time, as this Court knows, majority verdicts exist not only in six states in this country, as well as Puerto Rico, but in many -- in countries which formally were part of the British Commonwealth, notably, it had existed in Scotland 8-7 verdict for time immemorial and worked very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.056" offset="8384637">And England, as this Court knows, in 1967 adopted in the Criminal Justice Act of that year, adopted majority verdicts in criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.692" offset="8423194">Specifically, the law requires that where a jury consists of not more than 11, 10 can bring in a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.318" offset="8457676">Where a jury consists of not more than 10, nine can bring in a verdict provided that a verdict of guilty cannot be brought in by a majority verdict unless the jury has deliberated at least two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.466" offset="8498218">I think this Court is familiar with the fact that, in England, jurors drop out during the trial rather than alternate jurors, but that's immaterial and I won't go into that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.921" offset="8532072">As this Court also knows, because it pointed out in Williams versus Florida, we had majority verdicts in colonial times in a number of states, notably Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and the Carolinas I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.729" offset="8583272">As this Court also pointed out in Williams versus Florida, it rejected in fact in Williams versus Florida the argument that every feature of the common law jury, as it existed, at the time our constitution was growing up was incorporated in our Constitution every time the word “jury” is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.236" offset="8653385">This Court rejected that and pointed out that, as originally submitted by Mr. James Madison in the House -- to the House and as originally adopted by the House, the jury amendment required that, among other things, the jury – a verdict must be unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.872" offset="8715870">That it passed the House this way was rejected in the Senate and, as ultimately adopted, the Sixth Amendment only said that in a criminal trial, an accused is entitled to trial by jury, what kind, and impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.324" offset="8769682">It doesn't mention the number or whether it has to be unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.626" offset="8786923">Now, we get right down to the issue in this case as I see it, as was posed by this Court in a footnote in Williams in which it said it took no stand on whether a majority verdict violated due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.385" offset="8845960">And, as this -- as Louisiana sees it, the issue is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.908" offset="8860066">Whether the use by a state of a majority verdict in a criminal trial violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it infringes the principle that a person accused of crime cannot be convicted except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.138" offset="8933000">That is the issue for decision as far as Louisiana sees it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.273" offset="8945539">As Louisiana sees it, the equal protection argument is really subordinate and not important because if in fact a majority verdict satisfies due process, as we think it does, the equal protection question really goes out of the picture because, as soon as everyone similarly situated is treated as the way the appellant here was, that is, everybody in Louisiana accused of a crime for which the punishment is necessarily hard labor is treated the same way as we see it, the crucial question is whether a majority jury verdict satisfies or violates due process in the Fourteenth Amendment and that to us, is the crux.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.620" offset="9110841">Well, you can still have a -- it doesn't answer the equal protection claim, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.858" offset="9127873">You could say it satisfies due process for a state to charge $20 a year for an auto license tag, but it certainly wouldn't violate the Equal Protection Clause for a state to charge $20 to some of its motorists and $10 to the others based on some irrational classification, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.491" offset="9230378">Well, actually, the truth is, Mr. Justice Stewart, that as I studied this case and evaluated it, I arrived at that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.585" offset="9258695">I just express because as we -- I'll show later in the argument, there's no difference in the percentage of convictions between cases tried by majority verdict and cases tried by unanimous verdict, and that would be the crux of any unequal protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.411" offset="9322015">As I see it, what can an accused argue on his equal protection argument, unless he can say “look, I have a 10 or 15 or 20% greater chance of being convicted by a majority verdict than another person in my state has who is accused of another type of crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.449" offset="9390143">As I see it, that's the only type of unequal protection argument you can make.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.562" offset="9502678">But, our position in this case, there is no loss to the accused about -- by being tried by a majority rather than a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.401" offset="9537996">So, I don't -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think the argument is parallel in the view of the position we take because, certainly if one person had to pay $10 for a license then another person had to pay $20, right there is the difference of $10, somebody's being hurt $10.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.219" offset="10105271">I don't think if you allow a 9 out of 12 verdict, there would be any higher conviction right and the only trouble with having a 9 out of 12 jury involving -- when a jury has to bring in a death sentence is that, perhaps because death and putting someone to death fills people with guilt and awe, it may be that 9 wouldn't act if 12 held out as they will just for punishment because of the finality, But that's the only difference I see because, as I will show in my second point in this argument, there is no difference -- when you study the question and you'll see how juries operate, there is no difference between the conviction rate when the verdict is a majority verdict or when it's a unanimous verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.782" offset="10723537">Therefore, this Court's decision in Duncan cut across that first provision of our constitution which goes on and says “you see, it's very logical the way the con -- the way the legislature set it up in 1898.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.381" offset="11477953">The only way you can say -- the only logical argument a person can make about needing a unanimous jury requirement in capital -- in criminal trials is only two arguments they can make, as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.207" offset="11533228">One is the argument which this Court rejected in Williams versus Florida, that is an -- but which the Court had sort of sanctioned in earlier cases, but which it repudiated in Williams versus Florida and that is, that the jury as it existed at common law in England at the time our constitution was drafted is the jury that the drafters of the Constitution had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.112" offset="11624866">This Court rejected that idea in Williams when they rejected the 12-man jury because at the time the Englishmen founded -- settled American colonies, they had a 12-man unanimous jury, that was rejected in Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.539" offset="11674603">Now, the only other argument you can make is “look, I stand an unfair chance of being convicted under this type of jury system.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.746" offset="11719429">I'm not going to --“ See, they all get that the reasonable doubt standard is violated, and this Court held in In re Winship that the fact that an accused had to be convinced by proof beyond a reasonable doubt was part of the due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.419" offset="11782123">So, that's the crux of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.315" offset="11789646">If they're 9 out of -- if a 9-3 verdict comes in, it means that 3 men doubted and the burden of proof hasn't been carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.962" offset="11824232">Well, the flaw in that argument is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.819" offset="11839697">This jury came-in in 20 minutes, to answer the question of Mr. Justice Stewart I think, in 20 minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.490" offset="11882329">Statistic show in this Kalven &amp; Zeisel's Study of the American Jury with which this Court is familiar, I know because they -- this Court cited it in the Williams versus Florida, study show that any jury and the American Jury, this book, includes majority verdicts so it includes Louisiana juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.775" offset="11963517">Any jury with deliberate juror -- when a jury deliberates long enough, it will reach unanimity in 95% of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.853" offset="11995805">They say that over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.286" offset="12001552">That's why in the present case, there's no -- there was a 95% chance if this jury had not come back into the courtroom at the end of 20 minutes with a 9-3 verdict of guilty, there's a 95% chance that if they had sat there long enough it would've reached unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.112" offset="12076889">There is no chance in Louisiana's view that it would've acquitted the accused because Kalven &amp; Zeisel show in their book that once a majority, a great majority develops like 9-3 it is almost impossible for the minority to persuade the majority.</text>
