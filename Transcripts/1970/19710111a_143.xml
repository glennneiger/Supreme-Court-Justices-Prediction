            <label>Mr. Niki Z. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="31.223" offset="228289">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.518" offset="245426">The issue in this case is the constitutionality of Section 583.01 (e) of the ordinances of the City of Euclid, Ohio which makes it unlawful for any suspicious person to be within the municipality and Part (e) defining suspicious person as any person who wanders about the streets or other public ways or who is found abroad at later unusual hours in the night without any visible or lawful business and who does not give satisfactory accounting himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.326" offset="368724">Now, this question arises on the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.182" offset="384084">On April 19, 1967, an off duty Euclid policeman who was on his part time job as a patrolman or watchman at a very large apartment complex in the City of Euclid had his concern alerted by noticing a car driving slowly in the parking lot of the apartment complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.943" offset="499127">At a speed, he estimated as three to five miles an hour with the lights off.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.940" offset="519084">Secondly, he testified that his suspicion was aroused by the fact that the car stopped and discharged a “colored female” and he knew that no colored female lived in that apartment complex and this aroused his suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.491" offset="597347">The third thing, he testified that aroused the suspicion was that after discharging the female, the car, which was ultimately determined to be driven by the appellant or defendant here, James Palmer, turned on its lights, pulled down to the street and parked.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.557" offset="669550">Upon approaching the car, the officer testified that he noticed the appellant speaking over a citizen’s band or two-way radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.194" offset="720123">As a result of these three things, he asked Palmer to get out of the car, put him up against the car, demanded his license, his driver’s license which was furnished and asked him to explain what he was doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.038" offset="783548">He explained that he had left, discharged the friend, further inquiry about the identity and purpose of the friend resulted in no response.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="186.831" offset="850735">Does the record show what happened to the girl?</text>

          <turn speaker="niki_z_schwartz" startTime="190.391" stopTime="250.195">
            <label>Mr. Niki Z. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="190.391" offset="864946">The record shows that following the unsatisfactory response as far as the officer was concerned, he marched the defendant into the building at gun point called for assistance from the Police Department and a search was conducted of the entire premises and the girl was not found.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.725" offset="950314">Subsequently, the defendant finally agreed to state where he thought that the girl had gone to specific apartment number.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.538" offset="993573">They went up to that apartment, by this time it was 2:30 or 2:45 to 3:00 in the morning and knocked on the door at that apartment, the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.045" offset="1031502">And a male answered the door and was asked, “Is there a colored female in the premises?”</text>
            <text syncTime="240.016" offset="1063476">And upon being informed that the answer was no that officers left continuing to search on the premises for the girl.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="250.195" offset="1104123">Does the record show whether there have been any burglary incidents in the area in the immediate past.</text>

            <label>Mr. Niki Z. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="258.255" offset="1136410">The record shows that there were no reports of any incident of any kind that there was -- not ever any report of any crime having been committed that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.161" offset="1188028">Now, after Palmer was stopped, frisked, detained, arrested, searched, taken to the police station, interrogated, stolen car sheet checked, it was determined that absolutely no substantive offense had ever occurred and that there was not a (Inaudible) of evidence of any having ever occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.943" offset="1287189">And subsequently, Palmer was charged with being a suspicious person in violation of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.520" offset="1313416">Now at first blush perhaps, this case seems to be another in the line of cases, testing police investigatory power versus individual liberty, many of which incredibly arise out of the Cleveland area, Mapp versus Ohio, Beck versus Ohio, and Terry versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.234" offset="1392306">But there’s one crucial difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.494" offset="1401396">In those cases, the issue was shall a concededly guilty man go for woman, go free in order to serve some interest of constitutional liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.616" offset="1445804">Here, the issue is shall an innocent man be convicted and incarcerated in order to serve some putative interest in law enforcement or maintenance of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.710" offset="1490213">And I’m prepared to demonstrate that this ordinance on its face and as applied does great violence to hover constitutional rights and with no justification in necessity of law enforcement for maintenance of order.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.536" offset="1669517">There are three fundamental attacks on this ordinance, on its face and as applied and time perhaps will not permit me to deal with all of them as fully as I might wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.386" offset="1724897">The first is vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.767" offset="1738480">The rule of void for vagueness serves three primary interests, that a furnishing notice to those who wished to confirm their behavior to law so they might know what they may do and what they may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.468" offset="1801279">Limit the second purpose is limiting the discretion of law enforcement officers of Courts and juries within some described standards in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and the third is to prevent the ordinance from being construed too broadly to encompass or trench upon constitutional protected conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Niki Z. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="453.661" offset="1917994">Like what in this particular instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="458.138" offset="1935966">Frequently, the document presents a self most often in terms of First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.827" offset="1950699">In this particular instance, the constitutionally protected conduct involved is the right to liberty without -- except upon articulable suspicion or articulable facts that the constitute in effect reasonable suspicion under Terry to justify a stop and frisk, probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is being committed in order to justify an arrest and proof beyond the reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed in order to justify a conviction and incarceration pursuant to that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.724" offset="2106284">And so there’s liberty of movement here or the freedom of movement which is one of the -- of the constitutionally protected interest involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.778" offset="2138467">They’re constitutionally protect interest of the right to be free of discriminatory enforcement and these interests are served.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.798" offset="2174516">These purposes are served by the vagueness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.121" offset="2187891">Now usually when a case comes here on the issue of vagueness, the whole case turns on -- meaning the single word or phrase as we just saw in the last case, the real questions, what is annoying me and is that sufficiently precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.822" offset="2250689">Here, we’d got four or five phrases which individually each is vague together, they’re impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.631" offset="2277857">Wanders, what is wanders?</text>
            <text syncTime="545.385" offset="2284962">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="547.006" offset="2291440">We see in judicial opinions, there are at least three competing interpretations of wander.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.452" offset="2317145">In the Ohio Supreme Court decision of Columbus versus DeLong, you have the majority striking down the statute on the ground that wander, by virtue of being defined as aimless motion without any purpose cannot include a criminal purpose, therefore it’s limited to innocent conduct and therefore the ordinance was held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.259" offset="2408364">On the other hand, the dissent says that within the context that wander must necessarily mean or be limited to a criminal purpose wandering for a criminal cases or a wrongful purpose and therefore the ordinance should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.897" offset="2479000">In Seattle versus Drew the Court struck down a similar ordinance because they said wander can mean either innocent or culpable conduct and in that sense, in being too vague is too broad as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.252" offset="2540335">A broad at later unusual hours in the night with that visible or lawful business is as simply seems to me a night time version of wandering and without visible or lawful business begs the question as to what it is that’s prohibited and what it is that’s protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.558" offset="2597595">Is Professional Ricks walking the streets at midnight, visible or lawful business?</text>
            <text syncTime="628.643" offset="2617971">When he has no defined purpose, were not answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.509" offset="2633435">Then of course we come to the most incredibly vague of all phrases and the one that renders the ordinance most effective in my opinion, does not give a satisfactory accounting himself. Satisfactory account to whom, whom may demand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.469" offset="2697279">Who must be satisfied?</text>
            <text syncTime="650.256" offset="2704384">Over what period of time must they be satisfied?</text>
            <text syncTime="654.287" offset="2720475">It’s a credible, but untrue account satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.194" offset="2732178">Is it true but incredible account satisfactory?</text>
            <text syncTime="661.203" offset="2748165">It’s purely subjective and purely just throws open the door to the police officer in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.902" offset="2775019">The judge and/or jury in the second instance to decide whether it’s satisfactory and even to decide who must be satisfied, is the issue at trial, whether the officer was satisfied or is the issue whether judge and jury are satisfied?</text>
            <text syncTime="682.664" offset="2834056">Now, the same principles, the same defects in here in discussing this in terms of its propensity for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, ordinarily a statute which is inordinately vague simply by virtue of its vagueness facilitates arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.131" offset="2915871">But here, explicitly it authorizes arbitrary or subjective enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.835" offset="2954742">What the Court has previously described in other cases as Government by moment to moment opinion of the police officer on the beat.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.512" offset="2989432">The law as its drafted on its face can’t possibly be indiscriminately enforced across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.546" offset="3013569">It’s inconceivable that that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.231" offset="3024332">The law review literature is replete with discriminatory enforcement of these kinds of ordinances against Hippies, Yippies beatniks, bums, people of unconventional dress, behavior, length of hair and so on and against black --</text>

            <text syncTime="779.841" offset="3222758">On the other hand, dealing with the question of was the speed reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.761" offset="3246373">There are objective indicia that one can look at to determine reasonableness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.598" offset="7473716">They did a marvelous job in the trial and I think it’s obvious from the record of the trial that he was given much more latitude in the trial than any attorney would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.474" offset="7525230">I think he was treated fairly and justly and properly all the way through this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.132" offset="7539858">All I’m saying that in this case, race is a valid thing to bring up only as to identification of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.268" offset="7568488">That’s all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.302" offset="7584580">All right, further getting back to the original of the fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.015" offset="7603388">The driver then stopped his car and after he pulled out to the parking lot, put his license and communicated on a two-way radio which the policeman testified the modern day criminal is using more and more in this criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.590" offset="7681755">Now at this point, the police officer would have been nothing short of remise had he not proceeded further to interrogate the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.367" offset="7732851">There’s no question that he was proper in going forward as to ascertain just what he was doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.054" offset="7763571">The appellant then refused to give an explanation of what he was doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.341" offset="7784782">Now, we hear arguments that we cannot leave the determination of what is reasonable and proper to the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.973" offset="7815293">We must leave it to the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.745" offset="7826369">Uniform patrol man is our first line of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.588" offset="7841729">If he cannot be trusted to make a judgment on the street then why they are having policeman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.217" offset="8096266">Because in the Terry case, the fact situation would have been the same, officer McFaden in that case approached Terry and Terry had not been able to give an explanation of what he was doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.948" offset="8139212">Then under this ordinance, he could have arrested him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.062" offset="8163662">We’re asking you to extend Terry very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.068" offset="8187695">Now, this Court has often said that it’s not so much the wording of an ordinance was determined whether or not its constitutional, but the action that it allows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.163" offset="8236074">The conduct that authorizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.915" offset="8251016">Again, let’s go back to this fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.711" offset="8258226">You got a policeman who observed some activity that might make him believe that criminal activity was a foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.589" offset="8289677">He had the right to further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.338" offset="8304724">To uphold the constitutionality, this ordinance would not be an open door to police abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.146" offset="8319979">I still think that any --before any conviction could stand under this ordinance, the standard set out in Terry would have to be applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.772" offset="8366477">In other words, you cannot just see a man walking down the street and immediately say what are you doing here and you expect an explanation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.079" offset="8391659">The policeman inquired as he did in this case would have to point to you specific articulable facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.043" offset="8531571">If the man refuses or is unable to give a satisfactory account of himself to the policeman and is against the policeman’s judgment at this time as I think it must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.777" offset="8566471">Then he’s subject to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.187" offset="8580159">It’s necessary that there’ll be a combination of both and both are going to be absolutely necessary for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.552" offset="8601579">First, you’ve got have the ascertainable facts that the policeman observed why did he approach in the first place and then the refusal or inability of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.454" offset="8641181">Now, if the policeman -- well, strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.276" offset="8672528">We do not feel that this is open to discriminatory enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.436" offset="8693112">As was brought up earlier in the case prior to this, if the policeman is going to discriminate, he’s going to discriminate no matter what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.476" offset="8721324">If you mention traffic, of course in any traffic cases, it’s the policeman’s word against the individual’s word and the judge will almost always believe the policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.985" offset="8755284">We have Courts and we have juries and this is what this is for, that’s why they are for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.180" offset="8800110">I’m going to be very brief because I think the issue is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.213" offset="8820276">You get down again to the old argument, the individual’s rights against society’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.234" offset="8852355">You’ve only got to look at the crime rate on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.569" offset="8865625">I am not trying to but it’s true. You can’t walk down the street in this town or most other big cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.977" offset="8891329">We’ve got to give the policeman under beat.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.490" offset="8913377">You’ve got to give him the power to combat back this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.748" offset="8930408">Merely patting someone down as like in the Terry case I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.694" offset="8942111">They said, “Well, if he doesn’t find anything after path, then maybe he should watch him a little bit longer.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.203" offset="9132178">There’s also a lot of argument, debate took place before Terry about whether or not the limited intrusion of a stop and a frisk could be justified on less than probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.703" offset="9186200">Now, you’re asked to extend Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.874" offset="9194872">You’re asked to extend Terry to permit convictions on facts that it would most under Terry justifies stop and frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.307" offset="9228622">They want to extend the Terry to cover Katz. Katz was the third of the three persons frisked by McFaden in the Terry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.507" offset="9261432">Cops didn’t have a gun, the other two did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.104" offset="9271777">He wants to convict Katz too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.969" offset="9283271">Now, my position boils down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.757" offset="9298422">No question about that there’s to crime problem and there’s an interest in reducing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.415" offset="9317021">But that this ordinance is not necessary to reduce it because of other available means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.429" offset="9337083">You see, while the American Law Institute debates whether or not 20 minutes is a fair time to allow police investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.567" offset="9369684">While the uniform arrests that, that allows two hours and he was only three or four states have adapted it in 30 years because of concerned about its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.567" offset="9409599">The City of Euclid once allowed to detain him overnight convict him and send to jail for 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.535" offset="9433527">While the nation debates preventive detention, the City of Euclid want to prevent its conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.671" offset="9454007">That seems to me that the prices to be paid for what the City of Euclid has asked is too great and then it’s not necessary for law enforcement given the fact that there are other alternative means of dealing with regulating and permitting police investigatory power.</text>
