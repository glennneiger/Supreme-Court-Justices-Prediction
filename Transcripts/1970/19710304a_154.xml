            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1.437" offset="109171">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.017" offset="123486">I suggested yesterday that our submission that Article XXXIV violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment could conveniently be approached in four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.315" offset="176671">The first which I covered was to show that the indisputable purpose and effect of Article XXXIV is to erect an obstacle in the perils of the poor when they seek governmental action to supply their need for housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.085" offset="243754">It does not confront any other group seeking governmental action to satisfy its demands on the political system and that the provisions for the automatic referendum cannot be explained by the consistent application of any neutral or general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.748" offset="322330">Our second main point is to emphasize that Article XXXIV builds its unique bias into the very structure of the political system into the very core of Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.197" offset="380113">I stress that point also its obvious for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.214" offset="400280">It’s quite clear that in working out substantive policies lines must be drawn by Government and sometimes those lines are very difficult ones as in Dandridge v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.990" offset="447300">It’s also clear that substantive policies when developed by Government sometimes operate more harshly against one class than against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.434" offset="489096">An example is the currently much publicized litigations so not in this Court attacking zoning laws on the ground that they fenced the poor out of communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.161" offset="532041">The point I'm trying to make is that we’re not asking the Court to render a decision that has any impact upon those kinds of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.158" offset="571956">Here, the bias is in the way decision are reached by the political community and it seems to us that not only narrows the issue but that it makes the discrimination a great deal more wrong, it’s a discrimination, like discrimination in voting or in apportionment or even in the way one stands before the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="142.562" stopTime="148.837">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="142.562" offset="673625">Are there any evidence in this case if this was racially motivated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="148.837" stopTime="467.654">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="148.837" offset="698702">I don’t think one can say that there is any proof that the thinking of those who voted to put this into the Constitution was that there's any proof that it was racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.247" offset="756381">We do know that in its operation since it bears upon the poor it bears more harshly upon minorities than it does on any other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.859" offset="798804">That’s particularly true in the area of housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.543" offset="809566">I do intend to develop that point a little bit before the two arguments are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.453" offset="829210">But I think that this being a discrimination built into the political system that the case comes within what was said in Hunter and Erickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.117" offset="875813">The state may no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf that it may dilute any person’s vote or given a group a smaller representation than others of comparable size.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.213" offset="944253">The third main point I would wish to emphasize is that on the face of this statute, it singles out for separate classification the poor or in the words of the statute persons of low income.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.154" offset="1004022">And persons of low income are defined as persons or families who let the amount of income which is necessary to enable them and to live in decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings without overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.318" offset="1064626">Again, I think the explicit singling out of persons of low income narrows the issue that is here, it narrows it in several senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.481" offset="1109347">In the first place, there could be no doubt about the group against to whom the discrimination runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.031" offset="1139545">Second, this is not in any sense a shifting group, the poor identifiable and unfortunately to coherent a group in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.715" offset="1186252">It’s not like Williams and Rhodes were arguably the group came together for one purpose then broke up later or like Westbrook and Mihaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.242" offset="1228361">The California case dealing with the two-thirds the majority required for a bond issue where one could say that the group was temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.125" offset="1263888">But here, it is a continuing group -- a group who are experience tells us a particularly subject of prejudice, invidious discriminations in the area of housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.108" offset="1331806">This brings the case we think within principles of this Court has often noted for example in McDonald against Board of Election Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.559" offset="1377573">The Court observed that discrimination against the poor was enough to render a classification highly suspect and thereby demand the more exacting judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.475" offset="1421249">And in Mr. Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion in Griffin and Illinois, he noted the States of course are prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause from discriminating between rich poor as such in the formulation and application of their laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.306" offset="1496586">In this statute, we submit thus precisely then.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.289" offset="1516544">In other words, to summarize what I have said thus far the combination of an explicit separate classification of the poor with disadvantage in the very processes by which governmental decisions are reached and unexplained by the consistent application of any neutral or general principle, we think if it is not enough to condemn the statute out of hand is certainly enough to put upon the state -- a very heavy burden of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.504" offset="1665337">And I turn now therefore to the justifications which I understand to have been offered, they fall into three groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.007" offset="1699401">The first group might be said to be political, that is it has to do with the organization of government and it said first that the interest in popular self-rule or popular sovereignty explains the line which California has drawn here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.824" offset="1770663">The difficulty is that while there is of course an interest in popular self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.621" offset="1793860">That interest does not explain the line that California has drawn, the discrimination is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.953" offset="1823222">There are other items that do not require this automatic referendum in which there is exactly the same interest in popular self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.935" offset="1867107">Indeed, in this respect, the case is no different from Hunter and Erickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.998" offset="1887378">It said that Article XXXIV is a result of a whole that developed in Article IV, Section 1 of the California Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.206" offset="1928234">Well, if Article XXXIV was a reaction, it was an overreaction and it’s the over part of it if I may put it colloquially that we say that discriminates and of which we complain.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="467.654" offset="1974000">Mr. Cox, I don’t recall whether yesterday you treated the question or the problem of the community’s right to pass on what amounts to a discrimination in taxing of these projects that is this project will not pay its fair share of tax in the minds and eyes of this small home.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.261" offset="2092387">Now, isn’t that an important interest to deserve protection of a referendum?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="503.628" stopTime="543.757">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="503.628" offset="2117883">There is such an interest and these projects they will be less contribution by the government because it’s limited to 10% of the shelter rents on these projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.121" offset="2163858">Then they’re might be collected if the full value of the project was taxed as if it was privately owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.424" offset="2193115">But there are many instances Mr. Chief Justice in California where projects are undertaken some by the Government, some by charities and other private institutions where land and buildings equally are taken off the tax rolls and they are not subject to referendum.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="543.757" stopTime="549.440">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="543.757" offset="2278379">But those are quite different categories of federal government building obviously (Voice Overlap)?</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="549.440" stopTime="566.134">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="549.440" offset="2301158">Well, I never said with government building, I was thinking of the school or an airport, a university, medical complex, the parks, superhighways, all kinds of things that are taken off the tax rolls just like this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="566.134" stopTime="571.006">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="566.134" offset="2367927">Aren’t they distinguishable and that they serve everyone?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="571.006" stopTime="655.701">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="571.006" offset="2387362">Well, I think that to a degree and of course this is what the court has said in upholding public housing that public housing serves everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.862" offset="2422784">I would submit that this case in this respect is very like Shapiro and Thompson that there is an interest that the people have in asserting physical control.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.053" offset="2479626">But that that interest does not justify discriminating on invidious grounds against a particular class, there, it was a different class than here, but Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion is very explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.872" offset="2546813">It may legitimately attempt to limit its expenditures or I would say take things off the tax rolls whether for public assistance, public education or any other program.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.457" offset="2589236">But the state may not accomplish such a purpose by invidious distinctions between classes of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.021" offset="2615463">And I think to say while we’re going to be concerned about public expenditures and handle this differently where they benefit poor, but we’re not going to concern them or where the primary benefit are those who used an airport or those who used their superhighway or those who want to go to school or those who want to be in hospital is an invidious discrimination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="655.701" stopTime="673.321">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="655.701" offset="2726222">Suppose if we follow from your thesis that a state could not submit to popular referendum the question of welfare programs and welfare because by definition they are only for the poor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="673.321" stopTime="868.838">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="673.321" offset="2796648">Well, I would think if the only thing submitted to popular referendum on a continuing basis was a form of public assistance that that would be subject to an argument very similar to ours here, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.342" offset="2852760">But it’s again I think it is singling out a particular class and saying that in your “claims” if I may use the word in the loose sense against government. You don’t stand the same way everyone else does.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.995" offset="2903333">You don’t stand the way merchants do when they want improves streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.673" offset="2930082">You don’t stand the way that public does when it wants a superhighway or parents do when they want schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.069" offset="2955682">You have to get over this additional higher earning and it does seem to me that that's just wrong that it puts a brand on the poor that it is just as offensive as the brand of race in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.310" offset="3036662">Now, there's one other set of justifications offered and those have been labeled sociological and environmental.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.107" offset="3071770">Mr. Atkinson yesterday, raised the specter of the large block of public housing that we have seen in places like St. Louis; we have one in Hadley and Cambridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.997" offset="3115342">That just in fact is the rationale then Article XXXIV is both too broad and too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.493" offset="3153377">It’s too broad because public housing is not confined to that kind of project.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.297" offset="3184515">It involves small housing units and very similar to those built by private ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.904" offset="3206980">Indeed, there's no better illustration that may one in this record that was voted down by referendum because the proposal was to build not more than a thousand dwelling units.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.176" offset="3260061">Not more than four such dwelling units situate and anyone structure, may I just finish reading this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.348" offset="3296737">Not more than one structure containing any such dwelling unit shall be situate on anyone lot, this is record 29 and such dwelling units shall be disperse upon various sections of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.355" offset="3352743">So that not more than 24 such dwelling units, that would be six structures at the most you see shall be situate within a radius of 1500 feet from any other such dwelling unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.846" offset="3406764">So that what is -- put to referendum here is a far broader class of things, it’s too broad and not the kind of things to which the rationale is suppose to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.945" offset="3467160">Similarly, not everything to which the rationale it might apply is to put the referendum, but as I say Mr. Chief Justice that the form of referendum that I just referred to suggest the answer to the question you raised yesterday about how would you put the question affirmatively to the voters because it does described in sufficient terms the kind of project that would be or might be put to them to require in blocking up the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.500" offset="6329344">What California has done here is attempt to deal with an -- one area relating to the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.437" offset="6357138">It treated it on a piecemeal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.863" offset="6366856">It attempted to act within the context of that one area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.060" offset="6383574">Now, so far as I know the case on equal protection are uniformed in stating that there's no requirement that everything be treated exactly the same as long as everything within the class is treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.093" offset="6443760">Now here, you have the class treated exactly the same, the record is unequivocal, there's a stipulation in the appendix, which the Court can read that there are no other publicly-owned low-cost housing projects in California except the type that appears within the confines of Article XXXIV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.843" offset="6526725">So that what we’re dealing with is a self-contain classification rationally founded because of the gap in the constitutional provisions relating to referendum or referenda in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.265" offset="7404440">One of the problems in this case which I haven’t alluded to before that this matter came up on summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.467" offset="7469223">But the difficulty with the whole thing is that the appellants in this case did not have a sufficient amount of time to really adequately represent their client.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.776" offset="7522513">There had been particularly a great deal of work done on the pleadings, the research and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.033" offset="7547486">So that this matter was filed in San Jose all fully or fully developed and fully handled so that I would submit that there are number of questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.560" offset="7597641">As far as the Court knows now, there's no racial discrimination on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.327" offset="7628675">There is certainly no racially motivated -- well, I'll put it in other way, there's nothing to indicate in fact Mr. Cox admitted that there's nothing to indicate that XXXIV is racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.965" offset="7691264">So certainly, you can distinguish the Reitman case and Hunter on that ground and that's a very significant ground I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.500" offset="7721357">Secondly, there's no -- nothing here to indicate that this XXXIV has been unconstitutionally applied or unfairly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.070" offset="7751659">As a matter of fact, the record indicates just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.220" offset="7764302">The majority of the voting matters which have been presented to people in low-rent housing have been approved and as I pointed out to Court yesterday between 1968 and 1970 the number of approvals has significantly increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.302" offset="7828564">Just because the people might possibly in one area or another decide to turn down low-rent housing and that might or might possibly affect racial minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.137" offset="8103894">This of course is the identical case of 154.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.134" offset="8123956">It is here separately because of the belief of the appellant Shaffer who was one of the City Councilman of the City of San Jose that the other appellants had actually appealed not to get a reversal but in order to get the stamp of approval on the judgment which would have relieve them from an obligation of the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.079" offset="8211728">Now, as counsel has just mentioned to you, this case was decided on a summary judgment without trial on the most meager record, affidavits which merely identified who the plaintiffs were and some opinion evidenced that there was need for low-income housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.363" offset="8280795">Counsel has said that the City Council had no opportunity to prepare objectively it appeared that the case was in fact the same case case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.024" offset="8323427">The principle defendant was the Housing Authority of San Jose and the Housing Authority is not only not an appellant but it’s filed to brief in this Court seeking affirmance of the judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.639" offset="8365955">The case was consolidated with the similar suit, Hayes versus San Mateo in which the defendant defaulted and did not contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.400" offset="8396988">In the brief I filed in this Court, I submitted that this case lack that immediacy of controversy which justified the Court acting at all and I tried to express it in a combination of terms of standing, of rightness, of friendly suits, of feigned actions and I think the principles I was trying to express were more succinctly summed it up just 10 days are so in Younger versus Harris and that cluster of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.158" offset="8516002">However, I leave that and move on to the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.604" offset="8537840">I would submit this is a stunning case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.273" offset="8548498">It involves two of the outstanding expressions of American Democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.847" offset="8570755">One is the Equal Protection Clause and the other is the right of the people to vote on matters that concern them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.118" offset="8603878">And here we have had one of these the Equal Protection Clause is used to destroy the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.428" offset="8625089">Now, that's an amazing result in granting if it be assumed and decided that there can be a situation in which the Equal Protection Clause can be used to destroy the right of the people to vote on any subject they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.852" offset="8686738">This is not that kind of case Hunter versus Erickson which was in expression of that sort of thing is a wholly different case and all it want and needs to do if the Court please is to examine this whole thing in the context of California history and the structure of Government and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.679" offset="8754134">And I submit that no one and that conversant with California history and California structure of government could’ve made the argument that has been made on behalf of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.742" offset="8794363">It has been somehow intimated that the mandatory referendum was some strange and unique thing and the fact of the matter is it is the first and original forum of referendum at California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.122" offset="8839816">The petition referendum did not come into existence until the time of Governor Hiram Johnson in 1910 but for 120 years, direct democracy has gone at the very bone and marrow of California Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.042" offset="8899584">No other state has that been so true, there is not an election in California but what the pubic votes on 15 to 20 to 30 measures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.349" offset="9188812">Well, let me read you something from the brief of Housing Authorities in appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.327" offset="9204694">It is this unique automatic referendum requirement that makes Article XXXIV offensive to Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.921" offset="9235101">At least Housing authority has gone that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.428" offset="9253073">The automatic referendum is not unique, California has had both kinds of referendum and the automatic form is the older.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.020" offset="9283480">Crouch whom I referred to a moment ago says, three types of referendum are found in sake practice “that use was greatest frequency is known as the compulsory referendum.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.119" offset="9331858">This type is being used since the beginning of state government in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.054" offset="9347636">Now, examine the situations in which the automatic referendum had been used and you'll find they classify into three classes that all constitute one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.083" offset="9387656">First, matters having to do with the disposition of public property; second, creation of physical burdens on the general taxpayer; and third, the distribution of the powers of the sovereign people among their several agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.568" offset="9449618">In short, wherever the Government may be said to be acting upon itself California has insisted upon the automatic referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.799" offset="9482533">Counsel yesterday referred to the City Charter of San Jose about no park can be disposed off without a mandatory referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.781" offset="9514506">Franchises cannot be granted without a mandatory referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.828" offset="9530702">And here, we have all three -- disposition of public property we’re dealing with the public does on our house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.432" offset="9565080">Here, we deal with imposition of burden on the general taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.553" offset="9585560">Now, there’s been some contest in the briefs about that, but what happens is that in order to get a housing low-income housing project, the city or the county must waive taxes for 40 years and commit itself to provide all municipal services and the calculations have been that the contribution of the city or county to that project is equal to at least 50% of the contribution of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.016" offset="9691408">And that's a burden on the general taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.347" offset="9704782">Secondly, it has to do public to disposition of public property and it certainly has to do with the distribution of government powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.735" offset="9742294">And thus, it will be as observed at once that the automatic referendum of Article XXXIV is applied to the very kind of subject matter to which it has been tradition on California.</text>

            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="2439.052" offset="9859532">Exactly so and I’ll come to that develop it more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.263" offset="9872384">I would like to point out the nature of the petition referendum which came here under Hiram Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.564" offset="9893595">That has to do generally with the exercise of the police power wherever the government regulates the conduct of private parties not themselves, that's what the petition referendum deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.227" offset="9944273">Now here, we have the situation where a gap was discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.517" offset="9961409">When the Housing Act was first enacted, it was thought in California that projects were subject to the automatic referendum relating to bond issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.337" offset="9996727">And in 1937 or 1939 the Supreme Court of California said no and they did it upon the basis that a housing authority is not a city or county and the Constitution was cast in terms of city or county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.606" offset="10065795">Well, this is another example where the words of the 1879 Constitution have been eluded by new and genius devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.394" offset="10096933">But the people of California were in trouble because they thought we at least have the petition referendum that would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.474" offset="10121279">And then on 1950, the Supreme Court of California said no, the petition referendum doesn’t apply because it applies to legislative acts and we construe this is administrative or executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.459" offset="10169240">Thus, the people found they had no referendum and with, at the very next election in 1950, this XXXIV was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.651" offset="10201945">Now, what motivated them? We have in the record the official ballot arguments in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.873" offset="10222843">The ballot goes to the public or people with official arguments and there it’s in the record, it’s in the brief and if you read you'll find it’s all summed up two or three times to the expression “to restore” to restore to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.665" offset="10286059">Strength in local self-government can restore to the community the right to determine its own future course “restore to the citizens” the right to decide and they refer to the traditional right of Californians to pass on matters of this general character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.949" offset="10347186">Now here was a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.539" offset="10353560">California wanted to fill the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.522" offset="10361501">It had two presidents as to the type of referendum it should adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.553" offset="10377592">It had the old precedent of the mandatory referendum, it had the later precedent of the petition referendum and it chose the one and not the other and I submit there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that bent California’s arm and said you must adopt the one instead of the other particularly in view of the fact that this situation isn’t keen in all its nature to the thing is to which the mandatory referendum was a characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.914" offset="10491068">Now, let's ask this question, was there any improper motive in the adoption of Article XXXIV?</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.091" offset="10511757">It has been conceded that the record shows no such and I go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.818" offset="10534640">This case was decided among summary judgment and this Court has repeatedly decided Pauler (ph) versus CBS, the Fortler (ph) case that on summary judgment adverse imputations of motive can never be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.506" offset="10589393">Therefore, there can be no motive -- no imputation of an improper motive in the adoption of XXXIV, nor can there be any imputation of improper motive of the voters in voting on housing projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.485" offset="10637354">I would submit that the very thought of courts inquiring into vote or motives would be intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.260" offset="10664417">Since there can be no determination of the improper motive, let's inquire as to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.255" offset="10688345">The record contains and it came in by judicial notice was offered as evidence the figures on votes, on projects from the 1950 to 1968 and it’s in the record to the appendix at page 34 and you'll find several pages showing all the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.373" offset="10760861">The court below said, well it showed that 48% of the units were turned down, but what it showed was its 69% of the elections carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.100" offset="10795760">And the reason there was a disparity on the units was a monstrous 10,000 units in Los Angeles have been turned down the kind of project which the Housing Authority is now are ashamed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.466" offset="10845288">The record -- if you take the same judicial notice, you'll find that in all of the projects voted on from 1968 through 1970 84% were carried and the record also shows that of the 11 elections that occurred on a ballot of California on the same day that San Jose voted on this all but the San Jose carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.827" offset="10930657">Now, you cannot take those statistics and say that the voters of California had been using this law as a method of discriminating against race or against poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.899" offset="10970990">The statistics in the record are just the contrary. Consequently, I submit to the Court that this amazing judgment can be affirmed and the federal power can be use to upset the structure of state government if and only if on bare comparison of the face of Article XXXIV with the Fourteenth Amendment unconstitutionality is absolutely unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.051" offset="11063568">Now, that’s the precise kind of treatment of this Court 10 days ago or eight days ago in Younger versus Harris said should be indulged in very cautiously indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.872" offset="11106826">“For Younger versus Harris procedures for testing the constitutionality of a statute on its face and for then enjoining all action to enforce the statute are fundamentally at odds with the function of the federal courts in our constitutional claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.437" offset="11165132">Now, I come to the question Mr. Justice White that you put to me a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.905" offset="11183000">On what basis is Article XXXIV said to deny Equal Protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.048" offset="11203584">Who does it discriminate against and whom does it discriminate in favor of?</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.757" offset="11222392">There is a no claim that it discriminates among the subjects to which it relates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.868" offset="11242872">That subject is low-income housing and all are treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.653" offset="11258023">There is a no claim there can be no claim at California treats low-income housing differently from it treats other housing for one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.135" offset="11295953">California doesn’t have anything but low-income housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.651" offset="11309955">Now, there have been statements in the briefs and then argument that little income housing is favored by loans from the federal government, that’s the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.502" offset="11353422">The federal government has the power to deal directly what the people if it wishes or to deal through the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.449" offset="11381217">On middle-income housing, the federal government chooses to go directly to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.164" offset="11400025">California has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.957" offset="11411205">On low-income housing, the federal government chose to say to the state I offer you our assistance if you choose to take it and California says, we choose to take it only on the vote of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.900" offset="11454986">And so California treats all housing it deals with alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.373" offset="11472854">With one possible exception in the case of blighted areas under Urban Renewal after the place has been torn down, other housing is possible and it’s never been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.247" offset="11520397">It’s never been done and if the time to talk about discrimination might arise if and as sometime in the future something like that happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.868" offset="11554879">So, what does the claim come to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.688" offset="11566164">The claim comes to this, that there no mandatory referendum is required of some other kinds of government activity and I submit that this is no more at a claim that it is unconstitutional to require a mandatory referendum or anything unless required of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.518" offset="11649442">And that of course flies in the face of numerous decisions of this Court including this Court’s decision of 1970 in Dandridge versus Williams where the Court said that we are dealing with social and welfare matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.272" offset="11700433">The usual way of handling Equal Protection applies if you can -- any rational justification with the classification will hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.858" offset="11734810">And I've given more than rational of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.599" offset="11745782">I submit I've given overwhelming justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.237" offset="11760306">That brings me to Hunter versus Erickson which of course must be dealt with and I say that the resemblance between this case and Hunter is the most superficial thing based upon mere catchword of an automatic referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.947" offset="11811192">And I say that Hunter once you get over hurdle of whether you can strike down the right to vote at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.415" offset="11833031">Hunter versus Erickson was an obvious case and for this reason first place the motive in Hunter was racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.063" offset="11867617">The City of Akron had an ordinance prohibiting racial discrimination on housing and the very purpose of the charter amendment there was to repeal that and subject racial -- subject legislation about racial discrimination of the special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.923" offset="11923101">And this Court said in the opinion there was wan explicitly racial classification that does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.653" offset="11949955">Secondly, Akron already had a general referendum statute that was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.637" offset="11973883">The petition, the voters already had a voice and the charter change that to make it more onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.844" offset="12006797">The purpose of the amendment was to apply to anti-discrimination legislation a different procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.884" offset="12026859">Here, California had no voice of the people before Article XXXIV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.029" offset="12047444">It had to adopt something and I come back to my statement, it had a right to draw on either of the two precedents and it chose one and not the other and its choice was rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.764" offset="12090389">It was rational not only because we were dealing with the FISC, it was rational because we were dealing with questions of the whole environment which people live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.538" offset="12125497">Housing projects can change that environment forever and certainly people ought to have a right to have voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.987" offset="12151306">Now, counsel has said housing people are now spreading the units out and are no longer indulging on a mass institutional stuff which all people now condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.474" offset="12193311">But for 20 years, they were using the mass institutional to housing and that the people were wiser on rejecting projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.984" offset="12231346">They were wiser than the experts and the experts who just caught up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.254" offset="12248377">Now, I'm not arguing in favor of one kind of housing and another, I say these are the kind of considerations which justified putting to the people who are the ones to be affected a decision on what they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="4925.559" offset="19805602">But there are occasions when the construction itself is subsidized by FHA conventions which reduced the interest that the real estate development has to pay because the FHA pays the difference between what he can pay in the way of interest from the rents and what a mortgagee would require.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="5284.084" offset="21239724">I would think that one could be sustained and the other should be rejected, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.522" offset="21269504">Because I think the zoning laws is a sufficiently broad in general subject that it does not single out people who are subject to prejudice in order to discriminate against them in seeking their needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.842" offset="21354768">May I develop that part people who are subject prejudice just a little bit further?</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.937" offset="21383084">This of course is a law which raises a -- puts under a legal disadvantage persons who are in the low-income group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.786" offset="21430523">It’s not an argument here that the law works harder on those who have that money than on those who have it when the law is written in a nondiscriminatory fashion in its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.959" offset="21479215">Second, it seems to me that when speaking of the political process or the structure of government it is proper to characterize the poor as an insular and discreet minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.810" offset="21554657">That phrase has been used in constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.312" offset="21576600">Next, I would emphasize that discrimination against the poor is in very large degree -- a form of racial or religious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.535" offset="21629471">It’s in fact, all over the country minorities form a disproportionate part of the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.201" offset="21664162">The Douglas Report stated that it is of 1967, 41% of the poor using the $4,000.00 limit to describe the poor; 41% of the nonwhite were poor and only 12% of the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.934" offset="21723094">If you look at the population as a whole, 32% are poor nonwhite -- no, 32% of the nonwhite are poor and only 12% of the general population is nonwhite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.300" offset="21800521">In Sta. Clara, one find is looking not at the black population but at the Mexican-Americans that 15.2% of all households have incomes below $4,000.00 but 26.8% of the Mexican-Americans have income below $4,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.758" offset="21890382">And as the opinion below points out, I won't stop to read it in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.107" offset="21911803">It’s the minorities who have the intense need for housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.424" offset="21929044">Indeed, the President’s Commission on Housing pointed out that the need for housing among minority was three times as intense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.213" offset="21964257">Minorities of course form the great black of people who are the occupants of low-rent public housing and when people vote on these questions as the affidavits in the record make clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.946" offset="22015143">There is not much doubt on that what is on the agenda is the unwise poor -- the minorities whose housing is more notably inadequate than everyone else is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.004" offset="22067388">There are two other consequences which I can't say are written into the statute and which I don’t make our case turn exclusively on but other point but I think there’re important consequences in deciding whether this is an invidious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.052" offset="22131545">They go very closely together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.346" offset="22144711">The great problem in housing and the great problems that result from it come from the difficulties that persons of low-income have in moving to communities where the better jobs are, where there is opportunity for self-help and advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.243" offset="22220361">And I suppose there are two no better are examples anywhere in the country than San Mateo County as one goes down on the peninsula in California and San Jose down at the end of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.352" offset="22272815">And the problem is that there is no housing for people to move into those areas so that here there is an indirect restraint, I don’t liken it to Shapiro and Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.274" offset="22332479">There is an indirect restraint on freedom of movement to go and help themselves and there is also of course a resulting, built-in house preservation of the ghettos.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.775" offset="22394441">Because this kind of obstacle makes it difficult to build the necessary public housing units in counties like Sta. Clara and San Mateo and that too results in racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.697" offset="22466121">It seems to me as I say in deciding whether this is an invidious classification, a distinction against the persons of low-income who can't afford this housing that these consequences are properly taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.710" offset="22530173">But the heart of my case rests on the combination as I have said too many times, I'm afraid, of the built-in disadvantage not required on any other kind of interest of any other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.217" offset="22600286">The expressed classification of persons of low-income and the other absence of any neutral principle which California can be said to have followed in setting up the classes of those required to go to an automatic referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.605" offset="22685759">Taking those together Mr. Chief Justice, we submit that there is a denial of the equal protection of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5651.660" offset="22710000">Let me ask you just one more question on this category of minorities or relating to your classification of the poor in purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.871" offset="22758902">Suppose a given county in California, a small county had a bond issue up for $20 or $30 million to construct high schools and it was subject to a referendum, which I gather many of them are, would there be an Equal Protection Clause or a discrimination factor involved because the principal beneficiaries, the students couldn’t vote and that’s a fund issue?</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="5705.959" offset="22927235">I think that the character of the bond issue provision is one which is a general one relating to all bond issues is one that cuts against one group today and another group tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.279" offset="22988466">And therefore, one can say that this category was set up according to a uniform rule that doesn’t point the finger at any group in the community that says where we’re incurring long term debt, the kind of thing of course which in the history if the country frequently resulted in insolvency of cities and counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.775" offset="23086477">When we’re talking about long-term debt, we want to go more slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.143" offset="23103927">So we will set up a separate governmental manner of dealing with that group provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.415" offset="23133080">That doesn’t seem to me to involve any invidious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.018" offset="23151470">You do have the question here whether two-thirds can be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.360" offset="23176861">The Supreme Court of California held that two-thirds could not constitutionally be required, of course we’re not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.971" offset="23203297">I just recalling that for the Court’s benefit we’re not involved in that and I'm certainly not arguing the merits to that question.</text>
