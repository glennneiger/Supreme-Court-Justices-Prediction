            <text syncTime="66.220" offset="368201">The City of Gainesville, Florida operates an isolated electric system serving some 60,000 people and Alachua County, Florida and is a rapidly growing system with a demand doubling every five years in a concomitant necessity to continue to build additional generating facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.750" offset="462346">There is in Florida and there was at the time in 1965 an interconnected system of five utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.014" offset="499440">Our home were interconnected with each other, were selling power back and forth between each other and generally applying to each other mutual assistance and their operations in general were guided by an operating committee and their interconnections were founded upon bilateral agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.437" offset="597138">The City of Gainesville desires to interconnect with this grid or this pool and it was unable to negotiate an agreement with either of its closest neighbors, Florida Power and Light Company and Florida Power Corporation and accordingly --</text>

            <label>Mr. George Spiegel</label>
            <text syncTime="153.193" offset="716152">Yes, during World War II, there was an emergency interconnection with Florida Power Corporation which was severed shortly after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.729" offset="762337">We commission after extents of hearings under Section 202 (b) of the Federal Power Act ordered the interconnection and fixed the terms and conditions for the sale of energy across that interconnection and for the responsibilities which Gainesville would have to assume by way of providing generating capacity reserves to the interconnected system.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.283" offset="872469">And in general, the Commission fixed the same pro rata terms and obligations on Gainesville as what exists among members of the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.425" offset="925027">Appeal was taken -- a petition for review was taken to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals by Florida Power Corporation.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="213.238" offset="956374">Mr. Spiegel, would you say that broadly all the significant conditions for Gainesville are the same they are between and among the other members of the grid?</text>

            <label>Mr. George Spiegel</label>
            <text syncTime="226.952" offset="1011231">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.165" offset="1016038">There are some minor differences in certain of individual bilateral contracts but in general they are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.819" offset="1050624">But the Commission does require that Gainesville abide by the operating criteria of the Florida Operating Committee precisely the same as other systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.931" offset="1111124">Three issues were presented in the Court of Appeals, the first issue being whether the Commission had authority to order the interconnection and the court upheld the Commission on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.356" offset="1160756">The second issue was whether the Commission should be required to condition the interconnection upon the making of a territorial agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.044" offset="1207568">The Commission had declined to do so and the court had upheld the Commission on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.095" offset="1231705">The only question on which -- the third question and the only question on which the court reversed was as to a single aspect of the compensation arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.557" offset="1285622">There’s no disagreement as to what the price should be when economy energy flows through the system between a systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.987" offset="1315297">There’s no dispute as to what -- there’s no serious question as to what the rate should be when they arranged firm transactions, short-term transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.897" offset="1362944">It is agreed that Gainesville shall pay all of the cost of making the interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.430" offset="1389066">But the court took the position that because Gainesville was small and because it considered that Gainesville was receiving the larger part of the benefits that there must be some other charge of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.583" offset="1457716">And it wasn’t sufficient to accept the Commission’s principle -- its rule that when interconnected systems operate together, it is the duty that each one carry its proportionate utility responsibility and that is -- and that if it discharges that proportion of responsibility it has provided its basic cost burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.453" offset="1585194">Now, what the Commission is saying is this, that when a group of utilities are interconnected, each one brings some load to the interconnected system.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.159" offset="1628035">And that load say a 100 megawatts is a burden on the interconnected system.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.367" offset="1648828">Therefore, it must also bring some generating capacities to offset the load which it brings and it must bring generating capacity not just equal to its load but it must be something greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.511" offset="1709432">It must bring a reserve capacity so that in the event of failure of generator, there will be other generating capacity available to the systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.527" offset="1761468">And what the Commission here is saying is, that if Gainesville brings that capacity to the interconnection that extra capacity that reserve capacity to the interconnection which it is required -- which it would be required to do under the operating criteria of the Florida pool as each system under the Florida pool is required to do then it would meet its basic responsibility for not burdening the pool.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.199" offset="2080162">In other words, there’s a mutual arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.994" offset="2087372">In other words, we agree to backup Florida Power Corporation and through Florida Power Corporation supply emergency energy to any system that needs it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.106" offset="4171839">There’s been very little on the way of Commission orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.111" offset="4183855">This is practically a case of first impression of this type of interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.387" offset="4208933">Now, there is testimony by the experts of the staff who’ve examined a multitude of interconnection arrangements and pooling arrangements throughout the country and they say in effect and they testify in effect that the kind of standby charge that’s here being recognized is contrary to the general practices in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.808" offset="4326588">Now the court, you see, reasons that a firm obligation has been placed upon Florida Power Corporation even though the Commission states specifically that we are providing no firm obligation, no firm service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.050" offset="4407568">And so, proceeding from that the erroneous position it concludes that cost are being placed upon -- fixed cost are being placed upon Florida Power Corporation which the Commission said are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.223" offset="4472247">And proceeding further, the court then tries to decide or does decide that in its view there can be no reciprocity of benefits between the systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.713" offset="4526268">As the Fifth Circuit Court views it a big system can never receive benefits from a small system and all the benefits go on the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.720" offset="4574229">But here again is an area that was covered in the evidence and it’s covered by findings of the Commission where the Commission determined otherwise that there are benefits falling both ways even though one system is smaller than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.887" offset="4638908">There are power transactions that can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.029" offset="4651447">There is the availability of the reserve capacity which Gainesville will have and actually, the court determined -- the Commission indicates that these benefits can be very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.650" offset="4733994">So, here again, the court without, I believe, reviewing all the evidence before the Commission has substituted its view on the facts for the findings which the Commission has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.882" offset="4858859">And I think the case is as simple as that and it simply is an area in which the Commission had a permissible range of choices where it has developed a practice and a policy which is of importance in this case and could well be of importance in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.596" offset="4977768">And the court is saying that it’s beyond their authority that the company at the -- that the Commission is in error on the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.116" offset="12743868">It’s hard for me to believe that we’re talking about the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.704" offset="12770200">There’s an interconnection ordered here of 60 megawatts and when you evaluate the resources on each side of that interconnection, the likelihood that Gainesville can supply 60,000 kilowatts to Florida Power Corporation when Florida Power Corporation needs it is probably as great as that Florida Power Corporation can supply it to Gainesville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.622" offset="12885870">I think that’s clear on the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.363" offset="12896841">Gainesville has a reserve right now of 60 megawatts and the Commission found in the course of the years it would have reserves running in the order of 40% of its peak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.295" offset="12944593">So that’s 50, 60, 70 megawatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.484" offset="12957341">So we have power in our side of the system and secondly the Commission found that our units though smaller but because they are smaller, are more reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.145" offset="12999973">Our outage rate is much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.585" offset="13009690">They have these big units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.090" offset="13015751">They are probably the big units Consolidated Edison is proud of its big units but the big units have higher outage rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.303" offset="13120554">And actually a report issued only two days ago by the Federal Power Commission indicates a very serious reserve shortage in Florida for both Florida Power Corporation and Florida Power and Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.799" offset="13170604">Now, this report shows and as of this summer they expect that Florida Power Corporation will have something in the order of 5% reserves.</text>

            <text syncTime="4673.804" offset="18798634">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.539" offset="18813576">I think it’s important to understand what standby is and I don’t think that that is really yet understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.237" offset="18836355">Mr. Justice Marshall referred to it as insurance and that in the sense is what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.672" offset="18858088">Maybe a better definition it’s the order in the pipes all around the City of Washington where you have fire hydrants and you got quite complicated system of water pipes and fire hydrants and somebody is paying for those water pipes and those fire hydrants and the order that’s in there and that is what Florida Power is paying for and what we say we’re not going to get any compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.866" offset="18946800">We’re paying for the fire department, the fire engines, the firemen, the water pipes and the water and it’s there at all hours of the day and night and it’s constantly available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.498" offset="18985357">Now, we feel one of the reasons this has never come up before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.404" offset="19005001">This is the first time the Federal Power Commission has ever come up with this idea of relative burden, burden sharing, burdens and proportion to size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.381" offset="19048887">They’ve never -- nobody had ever, ever dreamed of such a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.456" offset="19065187">As far as I know, you can’t find it anywhere and any of their decisions in the one decision that they had on the subject, they said that charges across an interconnection should be based on the reciprocity and mutual exchange of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.587" offset="19133733">And the cases or the rights that have come up sense actually until this came along they really hadn’t passed on any rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.479" offset="19169259">They hadn’t had it force interconnection case and what we think makes this highly unfair and highly discriminatory where the Federal Government agencies Southeastern Power authority which is an agency of the Department of Interior has come in with the same kind of standby charge request, they’ve been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.570" offset="19253687">They are getting $2.75 of kilowatt per year for standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.432" offset="19285138">They have a 100 megawatts of reserve and they are selling it to three people on how really, a when as and if available basis and the contract say, that anyone of the other three are using it, it’s too bad though you can’t get it but this is being paid for every hour of the day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.731" offset="19370297">Now, when they actually take power if they should have a breakdown and start taking power, they stop paying this $2.75 and I think they’re paying $9.00 or $10.00 and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.735" offset="19430275">They pay a higher rate, but in addition to what they -- in addition to paying for what they take, they pay for the Fire Department, they pay for the pipes that are in the ground and the water that’s at all time is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.009" offset="19479385">Now, Gainesville -- something to say about Gainesville maintaining this 15% reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.464" offset="19501223">Let me show you how ridiculous that is, they had a 112% reserve when we tried this case and they propose by tying in to our transmission system and relying on us to reduce that reserve to 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.695" offset="19570186">And what is 15%? They got 100 megawatts of demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.089" offset="19587741">We’re talking about 15-megawatt reserve and here we need the 500 instantaneously and they’re going to reduce the reserve from 112% to 15% and they talk about that being a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.136" offset="19659943">And to me, it just doesn’t make any sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.062" offset="19675617">Now, the one expert who heard all the whiteness and the testimony in this case was the Trial Examiner and he decided this case right down the line for us 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.587" offset="19721697">Now, he decided that there should definitely be some charge for standby that it was well-recognized in the industry that where you pay for -- where you provide a service for which you get no return, there should be some charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.095" offset="19779793">And it is also not uncommon in these interconnection arrangements to split the benefits -- you decide what the savings are and one fellow it gets half and the other gets half and he proposed that standby be paid for by splitting of the financial savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.632" offset="19845935">We don’t object to that, actually, we think that would cost Gainesville more than what we propose to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.055" offset="19871640">Although, it’s never been fully price status but it’s a perfectly to be reasonable proposal and it is a proposal that’s used many of these interconnection arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.158" offset="19920018">Now, there’s something been said about our customers having a prior claim over Gainesville for the standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.379" offset="19952933">Your Honors, that is just ignores the physical facts of how electricity operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.914" offset="19974980">We cannot even subordinate the demands of our customer to Gainesville.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.858" offset="19994833">We got this large transmission system if you look at exhibit 32, which is a map of which, you’ll see that it’s a pretty large thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.845" offset="20034748">And that is a big electric transmission system that’s charged at all hours to the day and night to feed any demands for current off of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5303.883" offset="21318928">And we say proportion to size in this case is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.107" offset="21335751">They also argued in their brief and Mr. Gooch made a remarkable statement in his argument that the Federal Power Commission doesn’t have to pay any attention to Commission practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.749" offset="21374412">I mean industry practice, but in their brief, they acknowledged that the vast majority of interconnection between utilities are effective voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.359" offset="21424776">In contest to interconnection cases therefore and this is the first contested interconnection case that’s ever got -- hasn’t been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.566" offset="21457586">There have been about two or three others, but they have been always been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.169" offset="21472005">It is appropriate that Commission just issues for establishing compensation terms take into account the terms of current interconnection agreements arranged at arm’s-length.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.426" offset="21521115">In other words, what they said was, we don’t have any expertise, we’ve never been faced with this problem before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.036" offset="21547551">Therefore, we will look and see what the industry has been doing and every time you have given them an example of what the industry is doing, they said, “That’s not applicable, that’s not the same case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.077" offset="21599692">None of these cases are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.143" offset="21607946">None of them are identical almost every interconnection arrangement is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.868" offset="21626859">Now, Mr. Spiegel in his reply brief referred to interconnection we have at Tallahassee which was put in after this case so it’s not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.424" offset="21661027">He says, “We’re not charging them for standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.702" offset="21682134">We are not charging them for standby for two reasons and there may be others.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.910" offset="21699062">One is the interconnection is too small for us to supply them standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.055" offset="21723617">And the second reason, they have built some transmission for us so we’re getting some transmission from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.358" offset="21748799">All of these things had been done in arm’s-length.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.021" offset="21759457">They’re all based on an evaluation of what the various equities are and if there’s mutuality or any relative or reasonable mutuality and what each party is doing for the other, you don’t have a special charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.452" offset="21817135">But if one fellow is doing nothing, but getting a free ride, it’s standard to have him pay some reasonable compensation and if you don’t do that and the Government argues you’re going to des -- you don’t follow their position, you’re going to destroy the incentive for interconnections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.183" offset="21892054">We say if you don’t provide some mutuality or reimbursement or compensation that will destroy the incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.211" offset="21928208">What incentive that we got to interconnect with Gainesville or any number of other municipalities?</text>

            <text syncTime="5521.134" offset="22187865">We’re interconnected with -- through Florida Power and Light with Jacksonville which is a municipal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.931" offset="22211062">Those municipal systems are member of our operating group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.573" offset="22225690">But are there paying anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.845" offset="22238751">We’re not objecting to the fact that this is a municipal, that doesn’t bother us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.762" offset="22258395">We say that we shouldn’t do it for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.792" offset="22274591">Now, as they say the industry practice is definitely and positively to arrange for some mutuality and if there’s not mutuality to have an exchange of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.014" offset="22343450">Now, I’ll read one more thing out of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.412" offset="22361004">The report to the President of the Federal Power Commission on the prevention of power failures and it recited this matter of the problem of interconnections and the necessity for interconnections to provide reliability of service particularly the small systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.856" offset="22442820">And after pointing out the importance to small systems, it said that the same time the users must contribute their proper share of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.209" offset="22496214">It’s the Federal Power Commission talking before they decided this case and going on they talked about factors that should be taken into account “this is the Federal Power Commission reporting to the President to the extent that it may be physically impossible for small system to fulfill all such obligations in kind, equalization should take the form of exchanging power or dollars among systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.688" offset="22614079">No formula have been accepted as universal applicable to these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.365" offset="22636857">A wide range of pertinent factors are being considered such as relative benefits, methods or participation, reliability of service, conservation of natural resources, alternative opportunities and broad equities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.277" offset="22696521">Now, that is really all we’re asking to do to put their pocketbook so to speak where they must is and do what they say they’re going to do and what they have allowed federal agencies to do and the be fair to our system and to our customers who, if Gainesville gets a free ride, are going to bear the whole cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="5707.814" offset="22934653">Well, actually they would take two hours notice on most of their equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.130" offset="22955865">That’s just not the equivalent if we got two hours notice, we can start up our own generators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.563" offset="22977599">We got a lot of generators that aren’t operating all the time if we have -- maybe if we have 10 minutes, we can start up or two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.171" offset="23012080">Now we -- they as far as overtime is concerned until they get down to this reserve if they reduce their reserve down to 15%, anything they can give us overtime is not worth anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.068" offset="23067669">But as long as they have this 100% reserve, or they could give us maybe 50 or 60 megawatts overtime and divide that testimony over two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="5753.221" offset="23116257">But by the time two hours had expired, they got little unit, Your Honor, that a 5 megawatts, one of them is 1megawatt, 14 megawatts, we may have 125-megawatt unit sitting around at overtime, we can start up and not need Florida Power and Light, Orlando, all the other systems, they’re interconnected with overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.052" offset="23219597">And I would like to say one more thing and that is about, this business of their -- the testimony Mr. Gooch was asked about the testimony of Florida Power relying on this interconnection whether it was disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.701" offset="23282186">They put a man on the stand and made some computer studies and he took the Florida Power System and he treated as independent system with no interconnections with anybody and he found that we wouldn’t have enough power to meet our peak load or something like 25 days out of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.174" offset="23352090">This is all in the briefs, then he said, he got another study it may help you time in with Gainesville, they will only -- they won’t be able to meet their peak load 19 times of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.631" offset="23401932">So therefore, they’re going to rely very heavily on this interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.662" offset="23418023">He assumed and we had no connections that we couldn’t call on Florida Power and Light, we couldn’t call on the Tampa, we couldn’t call on Orlando, couldn’t call on Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.734" offset="23458356">Actually, we don’t have these deficiencies, we can meet our peak load unless we have big outages everyday in the year and this really, it’s such a theoretical study, it’s almost absurd and the examiner really cut off my if you look at the record and it’s in their, he really cut off my cross-examination on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.541" offset="23553546">He said, it’s the first time I have heard enough about that because he saw how ridiculous it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="5921.174" offset="23788022">Next point, the Commission imposed on the City of Gainesville and installed reserve capacity that would see to it that it would always be self-sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="5985.220" offset="24044231">What it has the capability to put across that interconnection is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.187" offset="24060113">Mr. Emory would have you to believe that Gainesville system is so adequate and so small that it has response and only two outages or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.315" offset="24104626">I point out as in the brief, they have the two 15-megawatt gas turbines, they have 50-megawatt generator and number seven unit and 26-megawatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.340" offset="24152691">Their testimony is they would always be running those too.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.852" offset="24166797">The seven, number seven and number eight and have the other two available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.039" offset="24187486">So I suggest that it is somewhat unfair to the City of Gainesville to say that they cannot respond with emergency power across that interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.362" offset="24228864">Now, as to the relative benefits, again, by imposing on the City of Gainesville a demand charge -- a standby charge based on the size of their largest unit, what that effectively does through rate treatment is to prevent the City of Gainesville from increasing the size of its larger generators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.624" offset="24329906">Thereby, increasing the amount of rate that the citizens in Gainesville will have to pay if t they’re going to be an isolated system.</text>

            <text syncTime="6088.717" offset="24458219">And the Federal Power Commission has recognized just like Florida Power recognizes that that it’s uneconomic and wasteful to carry more -- install a capacity then you’re going to need for a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.671" offset="24518092">And so rather than deprecate the City of Gainesville for being able to reduce their installed capacity, this is one of the purposes, one of the benefits of interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.980" offset="24567306">And Florida Power cannot maintain its own and does not maintain its own installed reserves by itself to take care of itself in the event of major outages on its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.028" offset="24627493">So it is easy to, I suppose deprecate to the contribution that Gainesville can make, but then we should also deprecate the contribution that Orlando makes which is not that much bigger than Gainesville which includes 100-megawatt firm sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.854" offset="24706800">On value of service, it seems to me unnecessary to say that a Regulatory Commission is not bound to take into consideration the value of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.436" offset="24761135">The value of electricity to a man in an iron long is a lot more than valuable electricity to someone making coffee in the morning, but that has not been and has not in this case the basis on which the Commission sets rates for utility.</text>
