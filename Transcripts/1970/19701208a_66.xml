            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="7.113" offset="131845">Very well, Mr. Segal.</text>

          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="9.969" stopTime="379.460">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="9.969" offset="143235">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.329" offset="156714">First is I am sure the Court would know, I should like to say that I do not agree at all with my friend Mr. Clark with the question here is whether New York Times and I assume he would include though he did not say Butts and Walker in the rest of the line are to be extended I quote him to 200 million plain people engaging in ordinary life.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.774" offset="270503">That is not the question on which the petition for certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.645" offset="285968">It is not the question in the petitioner’s brief and it is not the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.186" offset="312090">Further, I say with full difference that I do not agree either with the sketch of the facts presented by Mr. Clark, I must say that some critical facts aren’t exactly stated and other critical facts are omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.711" offset="366216">Therefore, I feel called upon as I had not originally intended to go into the facts with the Court particularly since in the cases I have referred to this Court has adopted the salutary policy of reviewing de novo the cases to find whether the standard for constitutional protection pronounced by the Court has been met in the opinion below whether Jury or Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.374" offset="468825">In the first place, we are -- Mr. Clark creates an erroneous impression when he says that there was a series of 21 broadcasts, a series of 21 broadcasts on WIP about Mr. Rosenbloom, there was no series at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.108" offset="543848">We’re not dealing here with a feature story, we’re not dealing with a documentary, we’re not dealing with the campaign and we’re not dealing with the crusade, we’re not dealing with the series.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.305" offset="580629">We’re dealing with statements which occupied one sentence to four sentences at the maximum in newscasts by a highly oriented station which every half hour of the day, 24 hours a day, 48 times a day, 320 times a week, every week of the year, everyday of the year, broadcasts every half hour of the year, and every statement before Your Honor fills that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.100" offset="687731">It’s a one sentence statement or two sentence statement or a four sentence statement and there is no longer one there.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.817" offset="714689">Now, the second thing my friend Mr. Clark did is he began with the statement of facts which said that on October 1st, there were arrests, 20 of them he said, Mr. Rosenbloom was one.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.145" offset="763904">Well, they were news dealers, they were store operators and they were distributor who supplied these store operators and news dealers, Mr. Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.403" offset="808939">And then he says the next to that was on October 4, when WIP had a broadcast to which he objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.259" offset="844361">Well, Your Honor, a great, great deal happened between October 1 and October 4, to which Mr. Clark did not advert.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.990" offset="875290">What happened here is that is a result of complains from the public, and after a two-month investigation, Mr. Howard Leri, not Captain Ferguson, Mr. Howard Leri I think acknowledged this perhaps at that time America’s leading police commissioner, later commissioner in New York, ordered the arrests by Captain Ferguson and he ordered the crackdown on what he then regarded as obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.407" offset="985004">I might say to Your Honors that Mr. Clark has made a good deal of Captain Ferguson’s definition and has ridiculed it and has said that this would make the finest paintings in the museum obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.753" offset="1034428">But I suggest to Your Honors that just a few years ago, few years before that, we’re now talking about talking about 1963, a Chief Judge of the United States District Court of the State of Washington gave that precise definition of what he thought a majority of the people in the State of Washington considered obscene and a very advertent United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, consisting of three Judges, everyone of whom served as a Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, affirmed on the opinion below stating that the Judge had found the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.190" offset="1156159">So there isn’t any shocking finding here, it was erroneous, erroneous under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.887" offset="1182908">Well, on October 1st, when the arrest came, all of the city newspapers had headlines about it and necessarily headlines about Mr. Rosenbloom who was the supplier, and the station CBS TV had headlines about it and that happened on the first and it happened on the second and it happened on the third and they are events to which Mr. Clark did not have heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.348" offset="1276740">And those newspaper articles and that CBS TV telecast said that Mr. Rosenbloom’s products were smut and were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.574" offset="1325641">And what did Mr. Rosenbloom do about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="307.171" offset="1332015">I mentioned just in passing he brought a lawsuit about two weeks later and he didn’t name WIP in that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.987" offset="1359287">I’m going to show he didn’t know there was a broadcast in WIP until October 27th, weeks later, didn’t even know there was a broadcast, but he brought a suit against all of the newspapers, against the Police Commissioner, against the District Attorney, one for a million dollars in damages and against CBS TV, not WIP, one for a million dollars in damages and the second to enjoin the Police Commissioner and the District Attorney from prosecuting him for criminal violation of the obscenity law and against the newspapers for calling his products smut and obscene and calling him a smut peddler and a peddler of obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.541" offset="1537546">Did not name WIP and he averred there that so great was his damage by virtue of those broadcasts by those people that all, nearly all of his costumers as the language his used, nearly all of his costumers returned all of his material to him which he had supplied to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.346" offset="1996779">My distinguished friend did the same yesterday when he said they were the same, they’re different.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.580" offset="2017677">The Judge who heard this case is Judge John Lord, that is the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.142" offset="2047979">Judge John Lord has since become the Chief Judge of the District Court and it has been good deal of amusement at our bar of constant confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.569" offset="2093641">Well now, what then happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.827" offset="2106702">On October 4th, Mr. Rosenbloom was rearrested and that was the day of the first broadcast of which my friends complained about WIP.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.179" offset="2164067">Now, I’d like to get one thing straightened out.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.217" offset="2176188">My friend says that there was a headline to that broadcast which read “city cracks down on smut merchants”.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.462" offset="2217253">I submit to you Your Honors he’s in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.172" offset="2228015">In the first place, the station doesn’t have headlines and I’ve asked my friend, one of the counsel who had all of the original records because the clerk had sent to him for reasons neither he nor I can understand, have asked him to give one of our boys who brought down to me yesterday all of the original records and I’m going to submit them to the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.263" offset="2316413">It would show Your Honors that most of them don’t have anything about headlines and even this one on the front cover apparently for the advice of the announcer is called repeating the headline news.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.268" offset="2372420">It was testified to by nobody as having been broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.409" offset="2389034">The manager said five years later, he wouldn’t say it was or wasn’t, but he pointed out that on the same day of the broadcast to which I’m going to refer, the one complained of, there was another item in the news about two people unconnected with this crackdown who were arrested and held in $35,000.00 bail for transporting hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.695" offset="2482134">He didn’t even know whether in advising the newscaster that this was what was in there among the leading news, whether it referred to the Rosenbloom group or whether it referred to the other group and there’s not a word of testimony in the record by anybody on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.694" offset="2538141">Now, what was the -- what was the offensive broadcast?</text>
            <text syncTime="613.398" offset="2556949">Well, Your Honors, it consist of four lines, it’s pretty nearly the longest of them and it says, here at 350a of the record, that a Jury of six men and six women, it’s the third paragraph if Your Honors are looking at it, 350a, it says a Jury of -- it says that the special investigation squad, it’s the second item, that special investigation squad raided the home of Mr. Rosenbloom, that’s a factual statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.569" offset="2689651">The second is police confiscated 1,000 allegedly obscene books at Rosenbloom’s home and arrested him on charges of possession of obscene literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.182" offset="2732074">And my friend say they don’t object to that -- those two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.664" offset="2742000">Then comes the third, the one they object to, the special investigation squad also raided a barn in the 20 hundred block of Welsh Avenue near Bustleton and confiscated 3,000 obscene books.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.311" offset="2788603">I suggest to Your Honors, if that is read in context, then the alleged of the pre proceeding sentence applies there and if it’s read out of context, my friend Mr. Clark is again in error in having said expressly that this said that Mr. Rosenbloom rented this barn, it doesn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.397" offset="2860910">If it’s read out of context, it doesn’t even apply to Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.363" offset="2872822">It’s just an independent barn at an independent address.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.511" offset="2901452">So read in context, the word allegedly simply carries over.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.301" offset="2916603">Read out of context, it doesn’t apply to Rosenbloom at all, it turns out later it was Rosenbloom’s barn.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.958" offset="2939173">The final sentence, they don’t object to and that is that Captain Ferguson says he believes they have hit the supply of a main distributor for obscene material in Philadelphia and that’s the whole broadcast Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.169" offset="2988074">Now, and then what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="722.521" offset="2993507">Within an hour, it was corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.919" offset="3007091">There were six more broadcasts, there was one and a half hour and then there were six broadcasts up to 8 am in the morning, every one of them put the word allegedly in.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.436" offset="3045125">So I suggest to Your Honors that it’s quite turn at the very worst, it was a slip of the pen to have let it out and at the very worst, it was corrected within the hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.571" offset="3081697">Mr. Clark said some of the later broadcast included it, every one of them starting with 7 pm, this was a 6 pm broadcast, had the word allegedly in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.203" offset="3128195">Now, after this series of broadcast, I emphasize this to Your Honors, there was never again a broadcast that mentioned Mr. Rosenbloom, never again a broadcast that mentioned Mr. Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.030" offset="3179499">Indeed, there was never again a broadcast on the subject for 17 more days, not till October 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.148" offset="3535914">Well, I suggest to you it was not news at all until October 21 when people got to know about it and then it surely was hot news because it was the first notice anyone had.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.156" offset="3580008">Now that, the hearing was postponed to October 25 and the next reference to the case, now, there were these broadcasts on the 21 saying the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.043" offset="3639568">On October 25 was the next set of broadcasts and the last of which complaint is made, there were these three, the October 4 arrest, October 21 case sat down for argument, the Court announced the postponement to October 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.606" offset="3693798">And so on that day there are two newscasts reporting the developments on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.087" offset="3715741">There’s only one other broadcast on November 1 to which I referred in reply to a question by Mr. Justice Stewart, and that simply nobody objects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.274" offset="3752417">It said that this alleged charge was to be decided by the Court within 10 or 11 days and there it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.565" offset="3789615">None of these broadcasts on October 21 or 25 named the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.661" offset="3814066">If anyone had a recollection back to October 4 of this arrest, there’s no way he could know whether it was Mr. Rosenbloom or whether these two other fellows who were there, was announced were held in $35,000.00 bail for the sale of pornographic literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.749" offset="3874356">Nothing in the record shows that a single individual listened or heard the WIP broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.156" offset="3911973">We know that after the most offending of them, a suit was filed, WIP was not even mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.989" offset="3939349">We know that the plaintiff said that he never heard any of the broadcasts and not a witness was produced who heard any of the broadcasts to this day, except one that I want to refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.226" offset="3988250">In just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.918" offset="3995042">Indeed, I think it would be well if I refer to him right now, out of the order of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.146" offset="4023986">Mr. Rosenbloom nor his attorney and he obviously had an attorney very early in this matter, ever contacted the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.975" offset="4055228">They never asked for a retraction, they never asked for the right to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.726" offset="4078320">I think I know why and I think I’ll tell Your Honor why.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.305" offset="4088560">There was one contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.295" offset="4096502">Now, Mr. Clark was mistaken as to what brought about the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.949" offset="4111130">The record is extremely clear on that and has two witnesses on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.637" offset="4129938">Mr. Clark said that there were complaints from many friends as to the WIP broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.989" offset="4151359">And so on October 27, he said, Mr. Rosenbloom went to WIP, was not permitted to see anyone, but had one tape played back, that isn’t the story in the record at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.619" offset="4201827">The story in the record is that he went to a restaurant where he met a friend named Chews (ph) who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.949" offset="4227218">Both he and Chews testified as to this and Chews said to him, say “I heard a broad”, he knew he was in the magazine business, say “I heard a broadcast”, they didn’t mention any names, “I heard a broadcast about somebody arrested and they said that they ought to put that guy in jail and throw the key away”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.093" offset="4295764">First, let me say there’s no such broadcast by WIP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.817" offset="4310601">The every transcript of every broadcast was brought into the room and adlibbing was testified, was not permitted, but he said that he’d heard this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.160" offset="4351979">Rosenbloom said “oh that’s me”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.562" offset="4365667">Now I suggest to Your Honors it probably wasn’t our broadcast because if you look at the broadcast on October 21 and 25, they don’t mention arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.939" offset="4403179">But nevertheless this upset him and he made a beeline to the station, that’s what sent him to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.059" offset="4431600">And when he came to the station, he said he wanted to talk to somebody about newscasts and they have a regular line right in the lobby, right to the newscasters for anybody who inquires about newscasters, he wasn’t denied anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.168" offset="4476008">He was given the line and he called the newscaster, a man named Nick Wright, and he said to the newscaster “I’ve been told there was something about me on WIP”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.352" offset="4528776">According to the record, he didn’t tell him what actually happened and the newscaster said, “well, you have to tell me the broadcast” and he said well, and must have just picked the 21st because that was the day of the hearing, give me the one at noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.529" offset="4585514">So the newscaster went and got them, the one at noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.843" offset="4606725">Now, there is testimony in the record of what was read, admittedly it was this one, so I’d like to read Your Honor what was read to him. This is the broadcast at noon on November 21, United States District Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.541" offset="4829497">Now, I suggest to Your Honors there was nothing in that to upset him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.456" offset="4845171">But his response, Mr. Clark spoke about what he said concerning the United States Attorney, its entirely true, he said to the newscaster, rather the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.331" offset="4888743">That the District Attorney had said something and here’s what he said, “the District Attorney says that my publications are” and I quote him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.983" offset="4931271">“Absolutely legal, absolutely nothing obscene about them,” that’s at 137a of the record, “absolutely legal, absolutely nothing obscene about them”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.996" offset="4971395">Well, here was a newscaster, he said there was a public statement by the District Attorney, he knew one there was no public statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.972" offset="4999293">He knew that District Attorney was prosecuting him at that moment, far from saying they were absolutely legal as nothing obscene about them, he was under criminal prosecution and number three, he knew there was a lawsuit by this very man to enjoin the District Attorney from proceeding with the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.784" offset="5062510">By that time I suggest to Your Honors that this man is subjected to half hour newscast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.454" offset="5081213">He had the conversation, he’d gone back, searched out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.171" offset="5096051">He found it, he read it to him, he had this other discussion and then he hung up the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.040" offset="5123532">Now I suppose he might have said “excuse me” before he hanged up the phone, my friends says he didn’t say excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.001" offset="5147355">But it’s on that particular finding, that particular incident that Judge Lord said that there was a request for retraction or even worse and it’s on that that Judge Lord said he could sustain actual malice, that’s the only thing that Judge Lord found in the whole record, to sustain malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.720" offset="5218304">I suggest to Your Honors that if you read Mr. Rosenbloom’s testimony there, if that is malice under any rule of law, then I haven’t read the case that would sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.776" offset="5266474">Now, there never was a request for retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.147" offset="5283924">The Court of Appeals by the way, this is what it said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.586" offset="5297716">The evidence of the incident lacks both sufficient substance and clarity to meet the standard required to show actual malice and it amounted to a little more than an argument and a difference of opinion between plaintiff and one of defendant’s employees, who I had was a part time newscaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.783" offset="5370546">Now Your Honors, there are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.486" offset="5389354">Your Honors, I suggest to Your Honors, that it’s entirely clear that they involved matters of substantial public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.303" offset="5432613">These magazines are displayed on newsstands, they are not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.973" offset="5455287">But this particular magazine, the only one in the record, my friend said the Jury read several of these in error, there’s only one in the record, the magazine, this one was devoted to youth, youth and nudism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.633" offset="5505860">It has a big article to teenagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.353" offset="5524773">It was displayed in drugstores, it was displayed on news counters and I suggest to Your Honors that many parents would object to having their children go into a drugstore for a bar of chocolate, see this magazine, its inside cover just simply has a nude woman with all parts exposed, its other inside cover has the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.673" offset="5614111">Now, I know that’s not obscenity, but I know an awful lot of the public consider that a matter of public controversy as to whether it should be displayed and the charge was against the display and sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.279" offset="10412492">Let me say a word to about the facts first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.338" offset="10420746">I don’t argue facts, the record can speak for itself, but some of views indicated in the nature of the argument and rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.556" offset="10465573">Mr. Segal complaints about our reference to a headline, there has been no, on this broadcast, there has been no complaint about reference to headline before, it’s clearly in the record, page 26a, it’s in our briefs as testified to at the trial and it characterized the nature of the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.974" offset="10535267">He complaints about our describing the broadcast to series, they were clearly series, they would go on every 30 minutes after they began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.381" offset="10564942">I described them as a single series, but its two series that over a period of time occupied almost a month beginning October 4 and 5 and picking up again October 21, going to November 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.103" offset="10619800">I think his reference to the record where Mr. Rosenbloom met someone in a café who describe the broadcast that he heard and his reaction shows the real problem of a little man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.319" offset="10672671">If you’re Edwin Walker or if you’re Wally Butts or someone and there is something derogatory said about you, your phone rings all night, the press wants to get your views about it, they’re anxious to hear from you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.620" offset="10781863">Mr. Clark, there may be a difference between a newspaper and a radio in this respect because of the obligation of radio to give equal time, an obligation that’s not shared by a newspaper, and that obligation means that your client would have or his friends and supporters will have access to the radio, wouldn’t it, on at least very station to express his point of view?</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.759" offset="10906415">The equal time theory and the law shows that we are prepared to require the radio to try to be fair, but equal time refers to opinion to raise, the editorialization of this did smack of sensationalism and the views of the trial Judge and of editorializing, but I don’t think that there has been any extension of equal time to the ideas obtained in news reporting, people as to whom news is reported have an opportunity to come on in and say something if a commentator has an editorial and he discusses you or an issue then you have an opportunity, but certainly within my experience, there has been no equal opportunity time on fact news broadcasting and I’m not sure how you would function with something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.269" offset="11072449">Mr. Rosenbloom couldn’t even get them to discuss the issue with him, how he would have gotten in, I mean they hung up on him, that’s how he can reach the Metromedia --</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.621" offset="11217899">Well, I think it may have to do with the difference between a radio and a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.705" offset="11230229">A newspaper we all know if it so wishes has the last word, it prints an editorial and it has no obligation to give equal time and equal space to an opposing point of view, but a radio station or a television station is in quite a different legal position, it has an obligation to make its own facilities available for an opposing point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.274" offset="11324479">I don’t believe there’s any law that indicates that there is a right to equal time for news broadcasting, but even if there were, I think Mr. Rosenbloom quite as clearly illustrated in this situation, you know Mr. Segal says it was October 21 when he first discovered about the broadcast, that doesn’t mean he wasn’t hurt, he was deeply and desperately hurt, but how could he know, he can’t listen to every radio stations broadcasting, how is he going to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.306" offset="11416639">He finds out when somebody tells him, and then he goes down and he tries to talk as a little man at the people at the station, they get a part time man to talk to him on a telephone that he can’t even see and that person hangs up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.673" offset="11458017">It’s very important too I think that we realize if this was submitted to the Jury on a single charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.988" offset="11483303">There was no effort by the defense in the trial of this case to say was this allegation true or false or obscene, it was all submitted on a single charge, the whole period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.353" offset="11524786">Had there been some distinction there then I think maybe this Court could try to make some distinctions between the separate allegations but when you take them all as a whole, they wind up leaving the impression that the man in the café who gave to George Rosenbloom, they want to lock that guy up and throw the key away, and that’s the best that he can find out as an individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.877" offset="11898859">Let me now state again my view of the law, before I do it, I think it’s important to realize that Mr. Rosenbloom was put out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.889" offset="11942954">He lost 34 of 60 accounts right away and he subsequently had to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.436" offset="11961135">I think there’s going to have to be some lines Your Honor on New York Times and I think the First Amendment will require these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.307" offset="11984645">Where the discussion is of an issue that it be uninhibited, robust, wide open, you can discuss nudism, you can discuss magazine distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.032" offset="12019545">That to have actionable defamation of a public official or a public figure because public figures are part of the story, they’re part of the process of learning the truth, they can be the done only where there’s actual malice, only where there is actual malice can recovery be made for defamatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.031" offset="12091538">But where you come to the individual, the private person who has no chance to engage really in robust or wide open discussion of these issues with Metromedia, that the power of technology and communication, the power to debate these issues in the marketplace of public opinion for private citizens in this country is very, very limited and they can be crashed as well as Mr. Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.440" offset="12177115">So, actionable defamation of a purely private person such as he can be maintained only where there is a lack of reasonable care, that happened to be the Pennsylvania standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.304" offset="12216613">That was the standard that was applied here, but to support the punitive damages, there was also a charge of malice and the Jury found actionable damages and it found malice under the Pennsylvania Law and that charge was very similar to the charge in the Butts case and as you know the Butts case, the recovery was allowed to stand, I think that would be fair here because there was no way for the Attorney for Mr. Rosenbloom at that time to ever believe that New York Times v. Sullivan could be extended from the commissioner of police in Montgomery County to George A. Rosenbloom when he was confronted by both the police and the press in opposition to his livelihood.</text>
