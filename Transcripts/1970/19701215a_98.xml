            <text syncTime="52.204" offset="312195">This Court granted certiorari limited to two questions, one being whether the facts of this case fall within the scope of this Court’s holding in O'Callahan v. Parker that crimes committed by a servicemen within the United States and in times of peace must be service connected if the Military Courts are to have jurisdiction.</text>

Parker involved an inquiry by this Court under the extent of the power granted by a Congress under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 14 of the Constitution to vest the Courts Martial with the jurisdiction over the crimes of servicemen committed within the United States and during the time of peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.688" offset="1302131">Number one, under the practical situation required -- involved, a crime committed in Germany, if the Courts Martial do not have jurisdiction over it, he would of practical necessity probably be tried by the host country’s courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.896" offset="1386977">Now, in any event, under those situations, he is not going to be granted the right to a jury trial, indictment by a grand jury in a civilian court of the United States and I think that the exercise of military jurisdiction in that situation may well be an exercise within the least possible power adequate to the end proposed, whereas if it were committed in the United States, I feel that it would be without the least possible power even though committed on a military reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.315" offset="1552593">I will point out that as the Court already has, the distinctions between the O'Callahan case and this case are the facts that the crime was committed on a military reservation in this case where it was not in O'Callahan and also this crime, one of the crimes was committed against the military dependent in that she was the wife of a member of the Armed -- the Air Force and she also worked at a post exchange restaurant, I believe on Fort Dix.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.140" offset="1967940">I think this Court looked at several factors in O'Callahan, one of those being the factor that courts are of necessity and validly so, probably instruments of discipline as well as justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.007" offset="2035440">Secondly, the existence of specialized military courts depends upon the special needs in military.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.108" offset="2079848">Thirdly, I think the Court found that the jurisdiction of military courts in light of these considerations and in light of history must be limited to the least possible power adequate to the end proposed, the end proposed being the maintenance of military discipline in the Armed Forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.011" offset="2575444">And the reason I say that I don’t believe the conclusion that they must exercise jurisdiction follows from the statement that they have an interest in maintaining law and order on a military reservation is simply that I think, the civilian courts exercising their jurisdiction, well, adequately served the interest of the military in that situation.</text>
