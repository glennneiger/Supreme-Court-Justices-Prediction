            <text syncTime="36.915" offset="251068">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.764" offset="266428">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and raises as its basic issue, the applicability of the finality rule of Cobbledick against the United States, to an order of a District Court which denied a motion to quash a grand jury subpoena duces tecum and at the same time modified the terms of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.197" offset="360155">It is our submission that the court below in holding the order appealable prior to any contempt conviction, disregarded the central conditions of a consideration and finality upon which Cobbledick rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.840" offset="418774">The relevant facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.416" offset="429014">On March 5, 1968, respondent was served with a grand jury subpoena, directing to he produce before a grand jury sitting in the central district of California, those records in his possession, control or custody, either personally or as a corporate director of five enumerated Kenya corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.245" offset="516368">These were the Ryan Investments Limited, Mawingo Limited, Mount Kenya Safari Club Limited, Zimmerman Limited, and Seven Up Bottling Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.637" offset="557955">Later that month, respondent moved to quash the subpoena, asserting among other things that its terms were overly broad, that he did not have control or possession of the records and that removal from Kenya as to certain of the records would violate Kenya law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.336" offset="624724">On five dates thereafter, the first April 9, 1968 and the last July 25, 1968, proceedings were held before the District Court concerning this motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.265" offset="676446">Arguments of counsel during these proceedings send it primarily on the issue of control, the relationship between internal revenue summonses, and the grand jury investigation, and the restrictions of Kenya law regarding the removability from Kenya of certain of the records without the authorization of Kenya authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.981" offset="767248">In dealing with this latter restriction or latter consideration, namely the limitations of Kenya law at certain of the records, the Court at July 12, at the July 12, 1968 hearing, indicated that it was making a finding of control and suggested that the parties enter a stipulation under which none of the records would have to be removed from Kenya, but that instead, agents of the Government representing the grand jury would be permitted to inspect and copy all the sought after records in Kenya.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.901" offset="899009">The Court made it clear that if defense counsel agreed to this arrangement, he would be waving only the authenticity of the records and that all other objections would be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.876" offset="946866">The Government agreed to this procedure and directed that the parties try to work out some arrangement, mutually satisfactory ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.828" offset="978735">The Court further pointed out at this hearing that if an agreement could be worked out, presumably Mr. Ryan would not have to appear before the grand jury at all in connection with these documents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="237.938" offset="1055117">The Government’s position was that Mr. Ryan was a Director who owned 80% of Ryan -- who owned 80% of the Mawingo which was doing business at Mount Kenya Safari Club but he owned 98% of Ryan Investments and that in fact he was in control generally of all these corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.920" offset="1155009">Well, that was subsequently, that was in the original subpoena but the Court’s order which modified the subpoena excluded the Pepsi Cola and one of the other companies, the Zimmerman Company from the reach of the subpoena on the ground that Pepsi Cola Company apparently had gone out of business several years before.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.555" offset="1253543">On July 25, counsel reappeared before the Court, respondent’s attorney said that it could not agree proposed stipulation since he did not believe his clients could authenticate the record source.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.985" offset="1303280">The Court thereupon entered the order which is here in issue and it's set forth for the Court’s convenience at 63 and 64 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.933" offset="1343091">In this order, the Court first made clear that it found that respondent had control of the records of two or perhaps three as the way one reads it of the five companies originally specified in the subpoena, that Ryan Investments Limited and Mawingo Limited doing business as the Mount Kenya Safari Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.708" offset="1434206">The order then contained three operative parts. Paragraph one, denied the motion to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.549" offset="1465553">Paragraph two, required production before the grand jury of all the sought after records of the two companies except for the type restricted by Kenya law which were books of account, minutes of meetings and lists of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.906" offset="1535039">And paragraph three, dealt with these restricted records in the following way and this is at page 64 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.645" offset="1569938">It directed that respondent forthwith make application to the registrar of companies in Kenya to release the restricted records and provided further that if you are unable to secure consent, official consent for their release, he would be required and was required to make these records available to Government agents for copying in Kenya.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.842" offset="1666696">Before the September 11 return date, respondent filed a notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.635" offset="1773902">And there is nothing in Kenya law as far as we were able to ascertain, although I think respondent contends the contrary which prohibits such copy.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.123" offset="4071842">As the Court will recall, Cobbledick involved the question of a District Court denying a motion to quash grand jury subpoena duces tecum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.035" offset="4151463">This Court affirmed unanimously and announced what has become the classic expression of the finality doctrine in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.486" offset="4193364">The Court first addressed the historic roots, noting that the first judiciary act had contained a finality provision, but did not solely rely under historical considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.575" offset="4549674">The Court suggested the same type of consideration that is bearing that and I’m quoting from Cobbledick, “Bearing a discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by an innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.083" offset="4611741">The correctness of a trial court’s rejection even of a constitutional claim made by the accused in the process of prosecution must await its conviction before its reconsideration by an appellate tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.724" offset="4670255">This doctrine was particularly applicable,” the Court was of the view, “in a grand jury situation because of its essential and primary function in the enforcement of criminal law as this Court has recognized repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.398" offset="4732949">Short 18 months generally and governed by a statute, an interruption of its work have to be avoided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.736" offset="4766281">Cobbledick concluded that interruption of its proceedings by an appeal by a balking witness was permissible only after the witness had been held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.349" offset="4820720">At that point, even though the grand jury’s process was being interrupted such interruption was justified, otherwise, the witness would have no alternative but to abandon his claim or languish in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.549" offset="4873592">Obviously, in weighing the considerations of finality against immediate interlocutory review, this Court in Cobbledick took account of the deterrent nature of the contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.558" offset="4913612">That the threat of the exercise of that power would have real potential in compelling an otherwise recalcitrant witness to produce or testify as ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.368" offset="4960841">This coercive potential, I submit, was deemed proper and was the balance struck in Cobbledick because of the overwhelming importance of the grand jury function and the need to prevent its interruption by the frivolous claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.501" offset="5021341">It could only be interrupted, the Court found by those witnesses whose refusal to comply was of such paramount significance to them that they would refuse even though faced with a contempt citation, contempt conviction, only if that point, the detail -- that the scales fit and favor of appealability and permit interruption of a grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.463" offset="5117262">Subsequent decisions of this Court have strengthened Cobbledick are referred by DiBella against the United States where this Court held, appeals unavailable to challenge orders denying motions to suppress evidence where criminal proceedings were in frame at the time of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.321" offset="5180688">In the course of DiBella, the Court significantly pointed out that every statutory exception’s finality is addressed either in terms or by necessary operation to civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.153" offset="5235963">There has been thus no retreat from the Cobbledick rule that the cost and discomfiture of a trial even as to a constitutional claim must be gone through before the witness challenging a grand jury subpoena may bring that matter to an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.868" offset="5310882">There is no sound reason, we submit, why these principles should not govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.921" offset="5335019">We point out again that the question regarding control and all other issues involved in the July 25 order will be fully reviewable on appeal if respondent is held in contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.500" offset="5429373">Well, the Court of Appeals stated and this is set out in precise language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.014" offset="5451421">It set out at 72 of the record and they said, “None of the cases cited had the District Court ordered anything other than compliance with the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.227" offset="5500322">In contrast, the District Court here modified the subpoena with respect to certain documents and directed the appellant to undertake steps in a foreign country to have those documents released by other persons for transportation to this country or for inspection in Kenya by United States agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.268" offset="5576495">In directing that affirmative action be taken in another country, the District Court did more than deny a motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.713" offset="5610245">It in effect granted a mandatory injunction, which given full-effect, would require action by officials of the Kenyan Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.447" offset="5649115">My answer is to that I don’t know what that has to do with the question of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.718" offset="5682239">The Court simply, it seems to me, by calling an order of a Court which has complete control over the grand jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.017" offset="5727483">The grand jury has no authority to subpoena documents without the authority of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.585" offset="5749739">And the court has full authority to modify and change, If a Court is limited by the notion that any modification which might have some affirmative effect, will result in appealability, we think that the courts will be hesitant to do what they should do, modify, change subpoenas of grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.010" offset="5839391">I see nothing in the fact that it in the reasoning of the Court of Appeals nor in the cases which it cites which takes this out of the Cobbledick rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.797" offset="5882546">If this takes it out of the Cobbledick rule, then I don’t know why a subpoena directing production of documents, for example which are located in New York City, which are sought by a grand jury sitting in Central District of California, is similarly not outside the Cobbledick rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.991" offset="5947329">The problem here, it seems to me is that there’s no sound basis for continued adherence to Cobbledick if one can simply by talking about affirmative directions of an order transform that into a 1292 (a) (1) injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.876" offset="6018905">The history of 1292 (a) (1), neither the history of 1292 (a) (1) nor its application by this Court in the Bollinger case, Switzerland Cheese Association case have indicated -- has indicated that even in civil actions, the Court has been not prone to apply that provision except where there is truly an injunction, and here, I think to talk about this being an injunction in terms of a grand jury proceeding, would hamper and to make it quite easy, to avoid the grand jury investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.262" offset="7240391">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.060" offset="7263587">The subpoena which was served on Raymond Ryan on March 5, 1968 required the production of records, corporate records covering a period of 30 years, required the production of these records even though they were Kenya corporations and all of the records subpoenaed were in fact located in Kenya.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.097" offset="7431711">Upon receiving the subpoena, Ryan as this Court has suggested in McFlow and Bryant out of respect whether tribunal seeking the records filed a motion to quash based on several grounds including oppressiveness, a violation of the law of Kenya.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.608" offset="7529827">I submit that petitioners in later proceedings, if this is not considered an appealable order would be well advised when being served with the grand jury subpoena not to file a motion to quash and not to obtain an interlocutory ruling as to whether or not there should be compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.891" offset="7642885">The reason is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.293" offset="7652498">That had this subpoena merely been ignored, there is no question in anyone’s mind to just look at it that this subpoena would in fact have been void and invalid, if not for being oppressive, and requiring the transportation of records 10,000 miles into the United States because the subpoena itself did in fact violate the law of Kenya.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.515" offset="7777468">Are those issues before us in this stage, the Court of Appeals did not rule on this, read through oppressiveness or other possible illegalities of the subpoena, it simply dismissed the appeal?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1932.031" offset="7831489">If the Court pleases, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the order of July 25, 1968 issued by Judge Manuel Real of the District Court of California requiring respondent Ryan to travel to Kenya and produce 2,000 pounds of records at his own expense covering a 30 year period was an appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.132" offset="7967848">And they further said that, it was appealable because it was a mandatory injunction requiring Mr. Ryan in effect to sue and libel, to act as an agent of the grand jury to travel 20,000 miles, to make application to officials of a foreign country, to attend and superintend the packing, the crating and the shipping of some 2000 pounds of records to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.009" offset="8095431">And if he does not, if he was unable to obtain the permission of the Kenya officials then he was required to make those records available for copying and I quote, “Agents of the Department of Justice and/or the Treasury Department.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.394" offset="8164916">There is no limitation in that order of July 25, 1968 that these records are to be treated as though they were subpoenaed by a grand jury, that they are under the secrecy provisions of 6 (e) of the criminal rules as required by the grand jury and in fact, there was no limitation on what right the Government had with respect to those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.272" offset="8252479">They could publish them in a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.283" offset="8260524">They could use them for a civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.522" offset="8269511">They could use them for any purpose even though ostensibly this proceeding began as a grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.972" offset="8303261">If I may address myself to the order that we’re talking about and the subpoena, the District Court himself made it abundantly clear on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.331" offset="8352684">He said, “It is not the subpoena that is the subject of the contempt charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.784" offset="8378493">It is not the subpoena that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.840" offset="8390719">We are talking about the Court’s order of July 25, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.650" offset="8417991">It is the Court’s order that Mr. Ryan has to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.384" offset="8436903">It is the Court’s order that Mr. Ryan is in contempt of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.193" offset="8456129">It is the Court’s order that the order to show cause was directed against as to whether or not Mr. Ryan had in fact violated anything issued by the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.717" offset="8502209">And the Court also stated in a colloquy that the order itself of July 25 was like a civil injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.169" offset="8544005">Therefore, once the civil injunction was entered, compliance must be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.411" offset="8568978">Failure to comply would result -- failure to comply would result in a finding of contempt and the findings and the legal issues could not be re-litigated at the contempt hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.995" offset="8635329">Thus, the -- I know it and incidentally, I know that the Government argued that the finding and the various legal issues would reviewed upon -- reviewable upon appeal if Ryan had in fact been held guilty of contempt and yet there is respectable which looks to the contrary and it has been decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.036" offset="8731564">It says, when a civil injunction has been entered as here and there is a failure to comply that then becomes a contempt and you may not re-litigate the factual or the legal basis of that order even though it may have the order may be reversed on appeal or by the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.528" offset="9157465">I submit, if the Court please, that order went far beyond any legitimate requirement that can be imposed by a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.371" offset="9196857">Now, if I may, one, I do not believe that any District Court or a grand jury or agent of the Department of Justice acting as an agent of the grand jury has the authority to issue a subpoena without prepayment of cause which requires an individual to travel 10,000 miles over to a foreign country and return 10,000 miles back carrying with him 2,000 pounds of records for getting the application to the foreign government for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.295" offset="9340531">I don’t believe that there is that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.218" offset="9352234">I know off no case and we challenge the Government to supply us with any case in which that was in fact a requirement of a subpoena, and they have come forth with none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.532" offset="9401448">And thus, if the Court please, equating the order and subpoena together, I think the subpoena goes far beyond any right that a grand jury have to force an individual to sue in labor as would be required under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.322" offset="9468635">To forth with as the order required, leave, drop that everything the citizen is doing, drop everything the citizen is doing, go to a foreign country 10,000 miles, 25 hours of air flight to get to Kenya, 25 hours, obtain the records, freight them up, bear the responsibility of bringing them back to the southern or the central district of California and to do this without any prepayment of expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.871" offset="15150895">They can’t say that this is res judicata at the trial level and then argue to this Court that it’s not an appealable order.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3789.380" offset="15260923">Mr. Feit, you have three minutes left.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="3791.039" offset="15267506">Yes, I’d like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.037" offset="15275551">First, in volume three of the original record which is here, I’ll refer the Court to pages 112 in which the United States Attorney makes it quite plain that these records would be used only for the grand jury purpose that is those who inspect the records in Kenya.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.537" offset="15345560">Again, on pages 90 and 91, where the District Court further makes it plain that these records and that the agents who were to examine them were agents in fact of the grand jury and there would be no violation of Rule 6 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.927" offset="15423091">It seems to me that the thrust to the argument here essentially is that Cobbledick really should not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.900" offset="15458931">As we have indicated, there is no question that this issue would be resolved or would be litigated on appeal, the validity to the July 25 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.031" offset="15495502">The question is to whether or not it could be reviewed in contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.792" offset="15506578">It seems to us that it’s the -- that was from April to June 25, 1968, the issue of custody and control was litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.298" offset="15540537">Just like a motion to suppress it seems to us, if respondent has additional evidence which would suggest that he does not have custody and control as the Court in a motion to suppress which had the Court to change its mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.706" offset="15594245">However, it’s clear that this is litigable on appeal to a Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3906.074" offset="15727679">Well, the appeal from the contempt and he -- counsel refers to cases which I don’t know of and which he refers to cases in which that order of July 25 would not be reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.991" offset="15775326">He refers to cases, I know of no such cases involving grand jury subpoenas and orders enforcing grand jury subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.630" offset="15809912">What happened it seems to me Mr. Justice is that, the initial determination was made that he had custody and control, an opportunity to litigate that on five occasions from April to July.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.285" offset="15852544">I would take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.771" offset="15854425">It would be something like law of the case not res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.576" offset="15869680">Quite clearly, if he could come in and say at that date, “I have something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.189" offset="15888175">I can show you by an evidentiary basis that I did not have custody and control of the records as of the date of July 25th.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.407" offset="15917014">It seems to me, just as in a motion to suppress where the Court could reconsider, the Court could say, “We reconsider that, and we find that you do not have control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.387" offset="15952959">Therefore, there would be no basis for contempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.548" offset="15961527">The Court on the other hand could well say, “You haven’t submitted enough for me to reopen this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.977" offset="15979290">I proceed with the contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.103" offset="15987754">The Government has the burden of showing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.233" offset="16000293">And on appeal from the contempt proceeding quite clearly, the July 25, 1968 order would be subject to full review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.909" offset="16031013">And again I say counsel referred to some cases to the contrary, “I know of none involving the area of the grand jury subpoena and the enforcement thereof by the District Court order.”</text>
