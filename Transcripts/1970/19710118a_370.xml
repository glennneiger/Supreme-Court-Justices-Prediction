            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in number 370 Magnesium Casting Company against the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.867" offset="250859">Mr. Chandler you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="39.059" offset="259636">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.097" offset="283773">It seems to be a relatively simple issue that we have because we stated it is whether or not the National Labor Relations Board may enforce a decision and order in an unfair labor practice case which is based upon evidence in the transcript that it has never considered or reviewed and based upon a conflicting testimony by witnesses that the Board or its Trial Examiner neither heard or observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.866" offset="450853">The background of this case involves the filing of a petition for an election by a union and a so-called representation case called in our case and appellants of the trade as distinguished from a “C” case which is unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.115" offset="519816">And the hearing was held, conflicting evidence was presented and one of the questions involved particularly whether or not the assistant foremen were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.501" offset="597347">The question involves some questions of credibility because there was conflicting testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.628" offset="625873">And this question as to supervisors became critical because the company had evidence that an employee that it contended was a supervisor was acting as an agent for the Union in soliciting authorization cards for the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.396" offset="696926">This would taint the interest of the Union because the Board has held that the solicitation of cards by an employee or representative is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.866" offset="730885">It is coercive and it does not permit of a free choice by employees of that collective bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.288" offset="772472">One must bear in mind that in that case under the rules and regulations of the Board and under the Labor Management Relations Act, a representation case is called an investigation and the results are not called a decision but a certification and it was interesting to hear the prior case where there is a certification of the results.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.784" offset="874559">And the Hearing Officer will be noted in the representation hearing on the Magnesium case set on page 79 of the record appendix is, we are in a none adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.020" offset="931401">The hearing in a representation case is not subject to any of the rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.960" offset="951254">This is in the rules and regulation 102.66 or to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act because there was a specific exemption Section 5 to the certification of employee representatives but not as to unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.810" offset="1018650">The Hearing Officer is actually one of the staff in the Regional Office designated by the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.987" offset="1059297">He is not appointed under the rules established for the appointment of Hearing Officers under the Administrative Procedure Act and he has no authority to make recommendations findings of fact, rulings of law or determinations of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.939" offset="1127111">The only reason that a representations case is handled in this manner is to expedite the processing of elections and representation matters and because in 1959 under the Act called the Landrum-Griffin Act which amended the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.249" offset="1216345">Section 3 (b) was one of the amendments which authorized the Board to delegate its Section 9 functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.881" offset="1246856">Section 9 function is only on representation matters as distinguished from Section 10 of unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.087" offset="1275695">The delegated Section 9 functions only as to representation cases to its regional directors are retaining discretionary powers of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.796" offset="1314565">Now, there’s no authority for the Board to delegate to a Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.063" offset="1335672">The Board’s obligation to make the findings that are required of unfair labor practices brought under Section 10 and as a matter of fact to make this more binding Section 3 (b) in the amendment said, that the Board could delegate any of its other powers to a three-man panel of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.988" offset="1423339">The Regional Director, in any event, presumably after reading the record because he wasn’t present at the hearing and the statute says that the staff employee who was assigned as the Hearing Officer may not make any recommendations, so he wasn’t able to evaluate by the appearance of the witnesses or by observing or listening to witness the credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.996" offset="1523336">In any event presumably after reading the record and without seeing these witnesses may it finds the credibility against the employer’s position and ruled that certain assistant foremen contended to be supervisors by the employer were not supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.608" offset="1581850">And then, another assistant foreman was in fact a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.903" offset="1595016">And his decision referred mainly to record statements that were adverse to the employer’s position and also more particularly to Mr. Scott’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.301" offset="1652590">And he said at one point that Scott himself testified that he wasn’t a foreman and yet he left out of his decision substantial testimony not only given by the employer and the employer witnesses but by Scott himself in which Scott made many, many statements about his supervisory functions and without trying to develop them because this isn’t the forum for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.186" offset="1768155">On page 88, Scott and this is in the record appendix that he recommended a raise to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.369" offset="1792815">He regularly attended the supervisor’s meetings, page 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.489" offset="1805354">He said, “I have the right to fire if I didn’t want a man I will get rid of him” page 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.730" offset="1822281">Page 89, “I am in charge of two and sometimes three employees but he agreed he was running the room.”</text>
            <text syncTime="434.657" offset="1842030">He had charge with the employees, gave disciplinary warnings, page 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.404" offset="1856972">Testimony by one foreman that all assistant foremen were told they have authority to discharge in page 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.959" offset="1879228">None of this appears into decision of the Regional Director who had the transfer confronted them presumably.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.848" offset="1922800">In any event, subsequent through his decision these conflicts in Scott’s testimony and the contrary testimony of other witnesses were called to the Board’s attention in a motion to review and the Board refused to review because that has set up standard in a representation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.849" offset="1990719">Now, we can't quarrel with them because the statute gives a Board the authority to set up this stand with and give them discretionary review in a representation case saying that must be compelling reasons and it relates to board policy and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.408" offset="2052995">So the Board refused to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.366" offset="2060831">The election results then were certified and the Union was certified as the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.542" offset="2085491">And the company position having bend that the employees were coerced because of the supervisors organizational activities on behalf of the Union and under law in case history, the only method for raising this issue was to refuse to bargain with the Union and a complaint would issue and this is what was done so that the employer could have a determination under Section 10 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.197" offset="2208162">There was no burden of proof incidentally on the Board or its agents in a representation case it’s an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.247" offset="2248391">The only standard is whether there was a question of representation whether an unfair labor practice case, the burden is on the general counsel to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an unfair labor practice exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.226" offset="2304293">The burden is not on the party to disprove that there was an unfair labor practice and this is the distinction when the Board refers back to the motion for review and says you prove to us and give us all the evidence you can marshal that you have reason to reverse the Regional Director’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.403" offset="2400946">Section 10 is not investigative it is advisory and it relates to the handling of these “C” cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.332" offset="2428740">Findings of violations subject the respondent to and the petitioner in this case, injunctive penalties including possible contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.505" offset="2461341">It requires the Board to consider the evidence and to consider the evidence under the rules of evidence of the U.S. District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.381" offset="2516929">These rules do not pertain in the representation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.035" offset="2531558">It requires that the Board exercise its own independent judgment and under 10 (c) to make its own finding and conclusions on a preponderance of the evidence taken before it can enter a bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.000" offset="2583385">And of course the Administrative Procedure Act is applicable, this Court has so ruled on Mastro Plastics and that requires that all agency decisions include the statement of the findings and conclusions and the reasons of basis therefore and all the material issues or fact and law were discretion presented on a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.279" offset="2672515">When the Board’s Trial Examiner issued an order to show cause after general counsel filed a motion for summary judgment on the unfair practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.963" offset="2703235">The employer objected on the basis that the evidence of supervisory status, all of the evidence should be reviewed by the Board of by a Trial Examiner designated under the Rules of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.942" offset="2767182">And incidentally, just about the time of the issuance of this order to show cause on the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.775" offset="2790484">The employer, petitioner learned that the witness Scott some of who’s testimony had been accepted from the transcript by the Regional Director and relied upon had admitted after the representation hearing that he have been less than truthful and had withheld information at the representation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.749" offset="2870418">The employer called this to the attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.239" offset="3156302">We asked for the opportunity to present facts on the issue and the Trial Examiner refused to take evidence or to review the record and he therefore could make no independent findings or fact or on credibility and he merely affirmed the Regional Director’s decision on the basis that the Board had refused to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.715" offset="3238222">The employer file the exceptions that are required under the Acts and the Board on a sharp one-page decision really rubber stamp the Trial Examiner’s decision who in turn have rubber stamp the to Regional Director’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.178" offset="3288064">And the First Circuit Court when it ordered enforcement of the bargaining order, admitted that the issue was a difficult one and used the term there are gradations of authority and it is a difficult decision but that they were deferring to the Board’s expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.027" offset="3351489">It’s an interesting term because they should have defer to the Board’s expertise but the Board’s expertise wasn’t involved here because the Board had neglected to perform the duties that were require of it often under Section 10.</text>
