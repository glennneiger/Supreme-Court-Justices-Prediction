            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The Court will hear arguments in the first case, number 203, Dennis McGautha against the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.778" offset="47020">Mr. Selvin, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="12.228" offset="48901">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.145" offset="64575">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of California to review a judgment of death imposed by a jury upon the petitioner after his conviction of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.723" offset="122880">The question that is raised and to which the granting of certiorari was limited, is whether California’s procedure of imposing the death penalty by leaving the choice of penalty to the jury in its absolute discretion, unguided and uncontrolled by any standards fixed by law is a denial of due process that there are no standards governing the process on this law of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.511" offset="241998">As a fact, it has been noted of many times by the highest court of that state and the jury in this case was told that in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.432" offset="277629">But to them and in their absolute discretion was confided the choice of penalty for which choice the law fix no standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.209" offset="316813">It is by plan to discus that question for what it is, a question of law, not one of penology, not one of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.505" offset="369998">The question of does not necessarily implicate the constitutionality of the death penalty per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.943" offset="403749">It is aimed primarily so far as our presentation is concerned at the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.213" offset="440842">The standardless procedure by which California imposes the penalty, that being so, I suggest that we are brought to grips with first principles arising under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.776" offset="519001">The main purpose, the basic purpose of that clause this Court has said time and time again is to prevent Government from imposing burdens upon a person from depriving a person of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.854" offset="587337">Save as this Court set expressed at one case, save by the valid laws of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.006" offset="619938">Now, that does not mean as this Court pointed out in one of the first cases of the rules after the Fourteenth Amendment had been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.271" offset="657032">That does not mean any law that a legislature may enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.330" offset="673228">It means only those laws that are consistent with the basic purpose of the amendment, that purpose being in a few words to impose upon the judicial process and the legislative process too for that matter, the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.072" offset="776255">It is a requirement because it is inherent in that purpose that law shall mean not something for the occasion or for the moment but some fixed and ascertainable standards by which a rule is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.766" offset="850965">Not merely so that individuals may be able to conduct themselves in conformity to the law, but as well so that the courts may determine whether in fact they have conducted themselves in conformity with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.018" offset="908016">In other words, the rule of law established by the due process clause, I submit, imposes a rule of decision or standards for a rule of decision as well as standards for a rule of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.593" offset="978338">We’d have, I suggest no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.759" offset="994952">No trouble with that concept if what were before this Court was statute of a sort said for instance that murder was simply any killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.675" offset="1038629">That in the absolute discretion of a jury was determined to be deserving of some kind of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.073" offset="1068199">We would have no trouble because the rule is thoroughly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.282" offset="1085127">That a statute must so define proscribed conduct as to enable not only the person to conduct himself lawfully but enable to a court to determine whether he has conducted himself lawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.418" offset="1145626">If that is so, if that is so in respect of the determination of guilt, why should it not be in respect of the imposition of penalty?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.528" offset="1186064">The process by which a person is deprived of his life is not a fragmented process even though the actual trial may as it is in California be divided into two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.302" offset="1237159">It is one process from accusation through the final imposition of sentence and there is nothing, nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that provides that it shall be applicable only to a part rather than the whole of that process and as this Court has said in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.727" offset="1310824">The sentencing procedure is not immune to scrutiny under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.598" offset="1342380">Well then if in respect of determination of guilt, the rule of law imports that necessity for standards does it not in respect of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.379" offset="1393476">The sentence after all is the final culmination of the process by which the defendant is to be deprived of its life or liberty as the case may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.473" offset="1465887">Since 1957, I believe Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.313" offset="1477172">It’s been quite a while.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="370.401" offset="1481561">And under California procedure, has it always been the jury which fixes the punishment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="375.610" offset="1502354">Since that bifurcated procedure, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.983" offset="1511863">And indeed, even before the bifurcated procedure, the jury had fixed the punishment for good many years.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="387.420" offset="1549584">If California has many other states, had a procedure whereby punishment was fixed by the judge, would you be making the same argument here today?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herman_f_selvin" startTime="400.002" stopTime="481.866">
            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="400.002" offset="1599948">Not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.426" offset="1609665">My submission then would be alternatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.038" offset="1624085">The first answer I would make is that if standards are required of the sentencing power, they are required of the judge as well as of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.609" offset="1662433">But the cases of the judges are classifiably different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.981" offset="1679882">And the legislature might well distinguish between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.885" offset="1695451">There is the matter of the judge’s special training and experience and expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.473" offset="1717812">There is his greater knowledge of the purposes and objectives of the criminal law, a knowledge that goes beyond that which an ordinary person could be supposed or deemed to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.958" offset="1755742">And there is the coordination of his own action, his own exercise of discretion to what he determines from his experience and from his knowledge of the law are the objectives and the aims of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.091" offset="1820317">That being so, the likelihood that he would arrive about a result intended or dictated by the law as distinguished from personal preference or personal reaction in this situation is so much greater that a legislature could very well classify between the two and insulate that classification in submission for many contention on writable protection of due process.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="481.866" offset="1927419">One last question while I have you interrupted, as I understand Mr. McGautha’s codefendant received a life sentence from the jury and I take it as your position that this difference in the imposition of penalty is indicative of depress in the part of the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herman_f_selvin" startTime="501.116" stopTime="597.756">
            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="501.116" offset="2004428">Well it is less indicative, it is not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.183" offset="2012682">So of course, I recognize as California argues that there were factors in the evidence upon which a jury might rationally have made a difference between the two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.101" offset="2060330">The vice is we don’t know that that’s what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.697" offset="2070779">The particular vices they weren’t told that the law makes whatever it is they may have decided in that connection, a distinguishable or not a distinguishable but a significant difference between the two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.923" offset="2127621">We, -- the California has said that the jury undoubtedly determined that McGautha was the triggerman.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.451" offset="2149773">Well, I would say that’s a pretty good guess but it is by no means an unelectable inference or even an inference that probably should be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.839" offset="2199301">The evidence on that score was in sharp conflict and under a statute imposing standards of a sort for instance that we find in the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.275" offset="2245068">Notwithstanding that the jury ex hypothesi was satisfied that McGautha pulled the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.748" offset="2274952">There might have been because of the sharp conflict, enough doubt in their mind so that under an appropriate instruction, they could have treated that doubt as mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.498" offset="2309956">Now I am not saying the Constitution requires that that be treated as a mitigating circumstance, what I’m saying is that that’s an indication of the kind of standards that could be framed, that could be imposed and that might lead to the very result understandably and inferably at which here California only guesses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="597.756" stopTime="605.064">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="597.756" offset="2390936">Is there anything in the record which indicates that anyone other than McGautha or Wilkinson pulled the trigger?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herman_f_selvin" startTime="605.064" stopTime="668.770">
            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="605.064" offset="2420193">Yes, there is testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.201" offset="2428761">Mr. Wilkinson testified in the fact that it was McGautha.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.064" offset="2440255">McGautha testified in the fact that it was Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.289" offset="2453107">There are some evidence from the proprietor of the store, the lady involved describing the activities of the two men. Describing the activity of one of the man who from her description of the size and coloration and the rest must have been McGautha, which was inconsistent with McGautha having been being able to fire the shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.752" offset="2546939">As I say, the evidence on that score was in sharp conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.446" offset="2565747">And the part then -- a matter of fact it was in conflict within the prosecutions own case, the jury didn’t have to wait till the penalty faces a trial for that conflict to develop cause neither of the defendants took the stand in the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.862" offset="2615380">But from the ballistic testimony on the one hand, the testimony of the proprietor distort on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.145" offset="2652578">There was a conflict in the prosecution’s case about which one of the two fired the shot.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.830" offset="3007216">I think that there is a considered and designed effort to impose the particular penalty into circumstances of this particular case, in judge’s opinion as an expert of the law, is what the law had in mind as a general policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.599" offset="3166354">The common law for many years and it wasn’t it until facts’ act and others, the jury decided the law in libel cases among other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.787" offset="3203135">It is not unknown to the law that questions of law may be submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.280" offset="3221107">But when they are, I suggest they generally admitted under recharge that attempts at least to put before the jury, the considerations of the law considers to be determinants of decision and that is what the California procedure does not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.642" offset="3282547">Now, if I may say just a word, if Your Honor please, about the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.584" offset="3302296">There could be no question about the fact that the jury does reflect the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.465" offset="3325806">There can be no question about the fact that a link between the community and the jury is an important part of our judicial system, but that link must be maintained and that conscience must be exercised within the limits of the Constitution and the jury must have those limits, explained to it and those limits must be fixed to the extent that they need to be made specific by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.012" offset="3419951">I need only cite by way of example to comparatively recent decisions of this Court in Reitman against Mulkey at initiative measure expressing the conscience of the California community overwhelmingly and directly in adopting a certain constitutional amendment, and California was held on unconstitutional by this Court notwithstanding that it was the direct expression of the conscience of community.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.789" offset="3523082">In Lucas, an initiative reapportioning the Colorado legislature was held to be unconstitutional notwithstanding that it represented the voice of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.297" offset="3561117">What I am saying is and what those cases illustrate is that conscience is in itself not an unbridle things so far as the law is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.432" offset="3789636">But there again, do we not have a classifiably different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.092" offset="3808340">In the first place, the range is a difference in degree, not in kind as it is in the capital sentencing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.879" offset="3851494">The sentence is a much more irrevocable fact once it is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.464" offset="3877825">The jury deals them with the type of situation and the pressures and the tensions and the simple means that lead to them with which they are much more likely to be familiar in the ordinary run of life than they are to be familiar with what it is that motivates someone who has killed another human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.841" offset="3963298">Well, that’s a very rough idea if you are to please of factors again that make non-capital jury sentencing a classifiably different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.262" offset="4017006">I take it that the Constitution certainly doesn’t require complete conformity or uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.897" offset="4055562">It certainly does not require logical perfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.856" offset="4075416">There must be some room in the joints to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.747" offset="4086909">I think as Mr. Justice Holmes’ famous phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.138" offset="4100493">And some latitude must be found in these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.112" offset="4120346">Let me say just a word if I may before I reserve what’s left of my time to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.635" offset="4150439">I mentioned briefly what seems to be the argument in opposition to the position that we have taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.809" offset="4175203">So far as California is concerned, about what it comes down to is that the penalty phase of a murder trial in California is a pretty fair (Inaudible) and all relevant evidence is submitted, procedural niceties are observed, and review of errors of law is provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.481" offset="4249913">Well, that begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.218" offset="4256810">The question is, our standards are necessary and if they are, are they given to the jury as the rule of law imposed in that phase of the case or isn’t it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.026" offset="4288052">It isn’t enough to say that the trial in its non-sentencing procedural aspect is a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.386" offset="4317518">The argument proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.998" offset="4323892">You could say exactly the same thing about the guilt phase of the trial and yet even California would not argue that the question of guilt vel non, not guilt vel non, but definition of the alleged crime could be left to the jury without any guidelines or standards or without any fixing by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.066" offset="4400170">The argument in the brief of the Solicitor General seems to be that jury sentencing is an old practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.793" offset="4435069">And being an old practice, we should retain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.109" offset="4456385">At least the question that it was -- the fact that it is unconstitutional has never been strongly enough urged apparently to have it decided -- to have it decided that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.766" offset="4499017">Well, this Court at the close of last turn seems to me answered that kind of an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.999" offset="4519915">The argument incidentally also begs the question because it doesn’t come to grips with the proposition of whether due process of law means law in the sense of standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.130" offset="4560457">But the answer was made by this Court in Williams against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.687" offset="4582713">Neither the antiquity of the practice nor steadfast judicial or legislative adherence to it insulates it from attack under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.801" offset="4619180">And it is that attack under the Constitution that we make here primarily for the reason to put it into one short sentence that it ignores the basic purpose of Fourteenth Amendment which is to establish the rule of law throughout the entire case, not just a part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.693" offset="4758674">I will say it first that it’s not necessary to my argument that it be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.561" offset="4786155">I am inclined to think that on balance, it would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.636" offset="4806531">Now the question might arise under the cruel and unusual punishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.022" offset="4820010">It might arise under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.164" offset="4836624">Under the cruel and unusual punishment clause, the argument that has satisfied my mind and my own reflection on it is that there were a 160 somewhat crimes for which the death penalty was a standard procedure to timely -- to time that Amendment of the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.736" offset="4914887">So far, as due process is concerned, I suppose it gets down ultimately to the question whether there was such a compelling interest on the part of the Government to make retribution of factor in the criminal law as to justify taking ones life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.444" offset="4985731">Because I would submit that only a compelling interest can justify the taking of ones life even for the commission of a heinous crime. But if retribution is not such a compelling interest, then rehabilitation and protection of society at all will rest of the purposes of the punishment that can be encompassed and can be furthered by a life imprisonment, but then will leave the answer to the question -- let me say, at least in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.512" offset="5090011">But primarily from the standpoint of are more or less limited attack on the California procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.038" offset="5120104">There is nothing that needs to be decided in that connection that in anyway implicates the death penalty per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.799" offset="5235148">It does not -- you see California, California hasn’t expressed any preference for one penalty rather than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.394" offset="5261479">Our Supreme Court has said so time and time again and in fact the juries told that and just about those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.833" offset="5291259">The trouble with the California situation is that the penalty for murder has not been fixed by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.684" offset="5322710">Now that’s quite a different thing, I submit, from saying the penalty is death but someone, be at the jury, the judge the Governor, or some administrative commission has the power do we dispense clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.719" offset="5374851">In that case, an argument could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.719" offset="5382792">I don’t have to make it but an argument could be made at the requirement of standards does not apply because there is no constitutional right to mercy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.415" offset="5565649">So far as the legislature is concerned, when it defines the crime with constitutional adequacy and says the penalty for that crime is one thing or the other, it has by necessary -- by implicitly set the standard and it has the legislative power within the confines of the Constitution to set the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.879" offset="5643494">So far as the judge is concerned, I’ve answered that question somewhat ramblingly before I think it’s classifiably different situation the legislature might do it and that justification for doing it would be found in the strong likelihood that the judges knowledge and sense of obligation and more particularly his knowledge of the objectives of the criminal law would in effect see to it that the sentence is oppose in accordance with the law’s purposes and intentions in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.597" offset="5810364">That is in substance but the California Court so set with respect to it’s indeterminate sentence law except that they find from the language of the statute some rather more specific standards than that but it comes down at to the same thing that having set the generalized standards than that but it comes down at the same thing at having set the generalized standards the objective of the statute, it’s then permissible for the legislature to imposed on one having the necessary qualifications of expertise, the job of seeing whether those standards are met in a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.392" offset="6061558">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.558" offset="6074201">This case on direct review from the California Supreme Court involves the single issue whether petitioner was deprived of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the procedure under which the jury was entrusted with the decision whether he should be punished alternatively with death or life imprisonment and the resolution of this issue will affect the sentences of each of the over 550 prisoners in the nation under sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.529" offset="6194051">The procedure which is involved in petitioner’s case under California law provided that after the jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder, additional evidence and argument on the issue of punishment was received and the jury return of penalty verdict after being instructed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.732" offset="6274926">First of all that the proper factors to consider in guiding its discretion in fixing the punishment were so and so I’ll get into those and more detail but they were instructed as to certain factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.224" offset="6336888">I’ll mention in summary form these factors included all the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the crime of each defendant’s background and history and of the facts and aggravation or mitigation of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.217" offset="6400836">The jury was further instructed to base its decision on the evidence received in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.351" offset="6425391">The jury was instructed as to the necessity of not being arbitrary or governed by mere conjecture, prejudice or public opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.784" offset="6463112">However, and if anything these tips the scales in the defendant’s direction, the jury was instructed that it could be influenced by pity, mere sentiment, or sympathy for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.084" offset="6524238">Thus, the question at bar is not whether it is Constitutional to submit the jury of penalty in a capital case to a jury without any standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.966" offset="6567811">The question properly before this Court in this case is whether the standards which are provided by California are constitutionally adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.168" offset="6608666">I might mention in response to Mr. Justice Harlan’s question that there are indeed two offenses that I’m aware of under California law which provide for the jury to fix the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.204" offset="6660807">Those happened to be Penal Code Section 193, vehicular manslaughter and Section 264, statutory rape.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.642" offset="6806465">There is a choice in some offenses I would just guess about three or four that the jury is entrusted with whether to send the defendant to state prison or instead to county jail and then in those situations specified terms are provided by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.550" offset="6970096">The offense itself, well, the victim was the owner of a little market which he and his wife operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.936" offset="7003742">The death of the victim occurred during a holdup committed by petitioner and his co-defendant Mr. Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.469" offset="7033835">Petitioner was 41 years of age.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.232" offset="7080856">He offered no threat, he was unarmed. He didn’t attempt to obtain a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.636" offset="7106456">He was five foot, three inches tall, a hundred and thirty-five pounds, 52 years of age.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.299" offset="7137176">There was certainly no reason to kill this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.923" offset="7151595">Petitioner -- there’s evidence showing that he told and Mrs. Dupree later on that he was the one who had killed Mr. Smetana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.956" offset="7187749">He also told the man who drove him up to Baker’s field that he had killed Mr. Smetana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.197" offset="7208751">It was McGautha’s gun I believe that was established is the one that fired the fatal shot although McGautha later indicate that he had loan the gun to Wilkinson had somehow -- that somehow exchanged weapons right before going in and of course the jury was entitled to weigh that evidence for what it was worth and what’s very significant was that the jury apparently stressed in its fixation of penalty who was the triggerman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.315" offset="7325257">What’s significant is on the issue of guilt, this was insignificant under California’s felony murder rule both men had committed first-degree murder and either or both could obtain the death penalty from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.065" offset="7380219">However, after the jury brought in that verdict of guilt, it was then that they’ve -- on two occasions as to have read back to them evidence of witnesses on that precise question as to the admissions made by petitioner that he had shot the man and other evidence bearing on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.810" offset="7463184">The district attorney’s argument which was very calm and collected ended with the sentence, “Members of the jury, I urge you to waive this evidence as to who fired the fatal shot and to give the man who fired the fatal shot the death penalty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.893" offset="7547507">Now furthermore, what do we have, we have two men with remarkably different backgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.542" offset="7574152">Petitioner is a four-time loser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.716" offset="7586795">He committed theft, robbery by assault, robbery and a prior murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.060" offset="7616157">By contrast, Wilkinson had no prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.037" offset="7628069">All we know is that he had some arrests which did not result in a conviction for a bad check account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.385" offset="7649489">And finally, petitioner at the trial refused to accept responsibility even as to the prior convictions which he admitted outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.467" offset="7689822">So we have a vivid contrast here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.030" offset="7700062">Now basically, respondent affirmatively believes that the death penalty and the procedures by which it’s imposed in California are constitutional but perhaps the best approach to the question in the case at bar is to consider the various objections which petitioner and his amici curiae have raised to the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.327" offset="7785221">And these objections are basically three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.896" offset="7799536">They are that the absence of fixed standards prevents defendant from knowing to defend himself at the penalty proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.402" offset="7829525">Secondly, that the jury is permitted to impose the death penalty for arbitrary reasons, dislike of the defendant’s expression on his face, the color of his eyes, the color of his skin, anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.045" offset="7896085">Thirdly, that there is no meaningful review of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.047" offset="7916147">It’s an arbitrary decision and that’s it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.032" offset="7924088">Well, an evaluation of these claims requires a brief outline of the special procedures provided under California exclusively for the conduct and review of penalty to determination in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.128" offset="8000470">First of all, even handed discretion is conferred upon the jury by Penal Code Section 190.1 and the standard instruction and counsel are allowed broadly way in their voir dire examination of the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.323" offset="8061283">And this case is a very good illustration of that, there were specific mention by the jurors that they would not take into effect -- into account rather the race of the defendants, no bias, no personal preconceptions nothing that they would base their evidence on the matters before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.244" offset="8152921">Secondly, there are special rules as far as the admissibility of evidence is concerned and this is in accordance with modern penological views to allow the jury to judge the offender and not merely the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.579" offset="8214256">So other offenses are admissible to show the defendants background but the prosecution must establish these other offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.949" offset="8251768">Secondly, prosecution evidence is excluded where it’s merely inflammatory and has slight probative weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.597" offset="8286354">There’ve even been cases excluding evidence that the victim died in an unusual pain where the California Supreme Court said, “Well, there’s nothing to indicate that the defendant intended this unusual pain to occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.514" offset="8342047">Thirdly, there is a very wide scope of evidence allowed in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.114" offset="8360438">The defendant can bring in and usually does bring in everything and anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.800" offset="8379141">He can bring in that he was kind to his dog when he was a little boy at the age of five, that he was nice to his mother, that he had tough breaks all along the way, everything he wants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.736" offset="8482900">But I’m not clear as to the exact amount of time but something in the neighborhood of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.833" offset="8523233">Fourthly, in this respect the California Supreme Court has gone a way beyond what this Court held in the William’s case no hearsay or incompetent evidence is permitted on the issue of penalty, the prosecution can’t comment and say, “Joe Blow heard that the defendant did this and all that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.961" offset="8599824">No, everything must be established by the same strict rules which govern the admission of evidence on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.748" offset="8638903">Now the argument that too is strictly curtailed, the prosecution is precluded from mentioning such things as the fact that the defendant might be out on parole in seven years if he gets the life sentence</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.076" offset="8696268">.He is not allowed to argue all sorts of things about the fact that the death penalty is considered by some to be a deterrent, he is not allowed to argue that the trial court might reduce the punishment in its complete discretion nor that the State Supreme Court or the Governor might do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.964" offset="8775784">This is not to dilute the jury sense of responsibility so none of that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.421" offset="8797623">There is a special rule of prejudicial error any substantial error whatsoever requires reversal even where the California Supreme Court would affirm had that same error occurred at the guilt trial of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.838" offset="8863347">And finally, we have very meaningful review by the trial judge who has complete discretion which he often exercises to reduce the death sentence to life imprisonment and he need not find any reason, he need not find any error of law, he need not do anything, he can reweigh the evidence de novo and for his own reasons which need never be disclose reduce that death sentence to life and that is done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.619" offset="9014439">In California, there’s always a two or three-week gap between the return of the verdict and the imposition of sentence at which time routinely a motion for new trial and for reduction of punishment is made and as I cited in my brief, no figures kept on this but I was able to find two cases in one week in Los Angeles County this year wherein this was done, that sentence was reduced to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.660" offset="9126557">And finally, the California Supreme Court, that review is certainly meaningful 69% of some 58 cases decided in the last three years capital cases have been reversed by that court on the automatic appeal that that court has evolve death penalty cases and the governor too has commuted approximately 40%.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.497" offset="9433966">They said, “Well, we’re not going to reweigh the evidence here as to whether or not this man should have receive the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.196" offset="10324741">Now, the death penalty is a very selective thing in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.169" offset="10344594">There is the statistics that we’ve cited indicate it’s a small proportion of murders which become murders in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.802" offset="10379180">In turn, it’s a small proportion of first-degree murders which received the death penalty and the statistics I think clearly wipe out any semblance of basis for the argument that there’s a racial overtone to the death penalty as far as California is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.333" offset="10465280">In fact, those statistics affirmatively show that if anything, it’s the Caucasians who have received more death sentences than racial minorities in proportion to their conviction of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.785" offset="10527138">Now, what I’d like to do is go back to these three basic objections now which have been raised and know how they bear out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.705" offset="10566740">It’s pretty clear that the defendant doesn’t have any trouble knowing how to defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.286" offset="10589100">At the penalty phase, he is free to take anything he wishes and his background and the most heinous criminal is always able to come up with some story, some excuse, some explanation for the jury so this isn’t any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.262" offset="10648973">As far as the jury being permitted to impose the death penalty for arbitrary reasons, it is essential to note that the jury is free to do this under any system, a system of fixed standards they can still do it, they can bet told don’t consider his race, don’t consider the expression on his face and they can still come back and do that and there is no system devisable by man that can preclude that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.961" offset="10763807">And in fact, the Royal Commission in Great Britain found that jurors were exercising their discretion in mandatory capital offenses where they felt that they didn’t like the death penalty for this particular individual, they would find the man not guilty or find him guilty of a lesser offense admittedly for that purpose to preclude imposition of the death penalty so there is no system that can get away from the possibility, humanly acceptable of some discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.230" offset="10896823">Now the standard which have been proposed by petitioner an amici curiae fixed standards this I think are rather unrealistic attempts to try and categorize every conceivable factual situation and this is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.319" offset="10961189">But what’s significant is I was frankly even startled when I reviewed each of the 128 capital cases decided by the California Supreme Court in the last five years I could not find one that did not include at least one of the aggravating circumstances specified by the Model Penal Code such as more than one victim, a victim of police officer committed during the course of a rape or robbery, during an attempt to escape custody or particular heinousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.654" offset="11102563">Everyone of these elements or rather one of them was always present and what’s almost amusing is that the fixed standards not only or they not workable or effective as far as their aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.652" offset="11158570">They don’t escape the so called vice of vagueness or arbitrariness because since it’s impossible to make an exclusive list of all mitigating circumstances and this is what really can re-down to the disadvantage of the defendant or aggravating factors they leave a loophole they say or anything else that would particularly indicate cruel unusual cruelness or depravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.838" offset="11263269">So it’s still open ended and I think that fixed standards would result in more death verdicts because jurors would feel inclined to say we’ll hear we find two or three of this things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.972" offset="11311856">The man has a prior record to that he shot more than one victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.698" offset="11326694">I guess this is in a proper case for the exercise of our mercy function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.663" offset="11346651">And how is an appellate court going to review something under these fixed standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.952" offset="11371729">How are they going to decide?</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.865" offset="11379357">There’s enough evidence of aggravation or there isn’t enough of mitigation and there some of each and we’re going to reweigh this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.076" offset="11404225">This is, I think an impossible task to try to impose upon an appellate court and of course despite petitioner’s denials it’s very obvious that his arguments implicate judge sentencing not only in capital cases but judge sentencing in other criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.518" offset="11498057">It implicates the granting and denial of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.238" offset="11512895">It implicates the fixing of indeterminate terms by an administrative agency and it implicates parole proceedings and possibly even clemency although that may be an extra legal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.293" offset="11573081">Now, this is basically what the fixed standard proposal means that the jury needs a list defining all the aggravating and mitigating factors and a formula for weighing them something like A+B+C-X and Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.579" offset="11630237">This I would like to inquire how does this aid the juries function in determining as this Court said in Witherspoon whether a defendant is fit to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.479" offset="11673913">This is not a matter for expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.300" offset="11685198">This is a matter of expressing the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.797" offset="11699096">The proposals that petitioner has advance would turn the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.664" offset="11722606">It would rather turn the fixing of punishment into a fact-finding process and this is totally foreign to the concept of punishment fixing even with special verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.431" offset="11765656">This couldn’t properly be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.381" offset="11777463">And I think this is important that to be effective, fixed standards would have to impel a death verdict in some factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.625" offset="11818423">They would have to say if you find these aggravating circumstances in return a verdict of death, however they leave a loophole, they say despite aggravating circumstances even if there are no mitigating circumstances you can still return a verdict of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.647" offset="11878504">Now this is probably just and proper but it shows that what these proposals for fixed standards really amount to in the last instance is a contention that there is a constitutionally impelled preference for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.013" offset="11951961">And this by the backdoor and this is a different thing from saying that there is a permissible legislative preference for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.480" offset="11985920">Where does the Constitution express a preference for life?</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.852" offset="12003370">It doesn’t and yet this would be the end-result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.030" offset="12016118">On the contrary, the Constitution and the Fifth Amendments speaks of capital offenses and recognize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.701" offset="12038792">And if you don’t have this loophole which the proponents of fixed standards that may then you have unavoidable and desirable jury discretion and --</text>

            <text syncTime="3061.938" offset="12247667">“Consideration of the choice of penalty could be standard around these objectives that is a penalty with a view of choosing that one which having regard to the circumstances of the case and the character and temperament of the defendant with mostly nearly further rather than frustrate them.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.631" offset="12382459">That is the nearest to accept cross-reference to the Model Penal Code set of factors which I’ve discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.258" offset="12408999">Now in a very short time remaining I would like to note this as Mr. Justice Blackmun stated California could abolish the degrees of murder and fix the penalty of death where there was a certain standard of aggravation consisting a premeditation or felony murder in the absence of mitigating circumstances which they could define as the statute does, the defendant being under 18 years age or else there could be a first-agree mandatory death sentence as Delaware has with the judges’ power to reduce it to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.949" offset="12547762">A discretionary power when the jury recommends that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.123" offset="12564480">But the logical end result of petitioner’s arguments is this, either no death penalty or a mandatory death penalty and we submit that either one is undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.595" offset="12610351">And in conclusion, I would like to state this first of all petitioner is no, in no position to raise this contentions which are not really applicable to his situation or himself these vague claims of arbitrariness, racial bias possibility and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.211" offset="12680777">The record affirmatively discloses a constitutional basis for this and as this Court said in Harris we shouldn’t permit the possibility that abuses occur to give sinister coloration to procedures that are basically reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.826" offset="12739291">Now, finally we submit that jury discretion is an unavoidable feature of capital punishment as the Royal Commission indicated even where there is a mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.430" offset="12785685">Aside from being unavoidable it is desirable from the standpoint of fairness as it enables the jury to best carry out its function of expressing the conscience of the community as Witherspoon sets out and not only is it desirable it is to the defendants advantage as we have indicated it would result in more death verdicts to have fixed standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.003" offset="12875964">And as some of petitioners amici are ready to admit their theoretical and unrealistic campaign for fixed standards, artificial and arbitrarily fixed standards is only a device to abolish the death penalty at least with respect to the 550 men now under sentence of death and they admitted in Maxwell v. Bishop that they are ready to urge the very unconstitutionality of those fixed standards whose absence they now decry as constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.515" offset="13006054">So before accepting the theoretical arguments of petitioner and his amici that fixed standards are the only procedure that a state may enact for jury determination of penalty in capital cases, it must be remembered that over 550 dangerous persons who committed the worst of the most vicious crimes would be perhaps permanently immunized from receiving the death sentence despite to considered judgment of thousands of jurors and hundreds of judges that the interest of society demanded the extreme penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.475" offset="13297894">Before I begin my argument I would like to make two emendations in the brief we have filed and the first is in the tabulation on page 130 showing the chronological development of the introduction of jury discretion into all of the statutes of all the states near the bottom of page 130.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.169" offset="13408653">There’s a reference to the New York statute at which they’re dated 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.262" offset="13436970">Actually, the New York statute of 1937 applied only to felony murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.104" offset="13460376">It was not until 1963 that New York extended jury discretion to all murders and then on page 138 where we list the federal statutes authorizing jury discretion they first to the federal statute there cited 18 U.S.C. 837 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.401" offset="13577509">The first to the Federal Statute 18 U.S.C. 837 (b) is now been repealed since our brief was filed and they say this was not a lack of foresight on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.843" offset="13631321">It was repealed by the organize Crime Control Act of 1970 signed by the President on October 15 and by the same Act Section 844 of Title 18 was added and that statute gives the jury or the judge a power to fix the death penalty thus admitting the problem disclosed by the Jackson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.729" offset="13742916">Because of the importance of these cases this case in the following one it’s especially important to bear in mind what is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.695" offset="13794743">These cases do not directly involve the general question of the validity of the death penalty although they are of course an indirect attack on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.433" offset="13841659">In order to involve any question of the application of the death penalty in cases of rape at which was involved in Maxwell against Bishop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.597" offset="13878335">In both cases, the convictions before the Court were for the crime of murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.113" offset="13900382">And finally, there is no suggestion on the record and no contention on behalf of the petitioners that there has been discrimination here on the basis of race either in the selection of the jury in the evidence presented or in the ruling as to charge of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.981" offset="13983869">In this case, the McGautha case the only question is whether the Constitution requires the legislatures of the States and Congress to spell out what are called standards so they’re never disclose which must be put before the jury as a part of the process by which they determine whether the penalty for the particular murder shall be death or life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.895" offset="14099540">That question too is involved on the Crampton case and my argument here will be applicable to that case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.322" offset="14145202">The Crampton case also involves the additional question as to whether the Constitution then requires a split or bifurcated trials separating the question of guilt from the question of penalty that is not involved here as California does provide a split trial and I will discuss that in the time allocated to me for argument in the Crampton case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.662" offset="14294622">No Mr. Justice, California has had the bifurcated trial since 1957 and jury discretion came into California in 1874 which was 83 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.533" offset="14350106">California was one of the relative early states to adopt jury discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.841" offset="14379363">Both of the questions in these two cases it seems to me fall within the realm of federal state relationships how far are these matters which fall within those areas which ought to be for determination by the several states or are they matters where the states have yielded up their power by joining the federal compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.720" offset="14490854">And in another sense, the cases may be thought of as presenting a problem of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.450" offset="14521783">How far these matters for determination by the legislative branch of the Government are both state or federal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.698" offset="14554697">Or how far are they matters for determination by the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.618" offset="14574446">In either aspect, the questions are of course appropriate for decision by this Court as the ultimate arbiter on federal constitutional questions for the nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.389" offset="14625541">With respect to standards, there are certain things that are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.500" offset="14649992">In the first place, there is nothing specific in the Constitution relating to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.229" offset="14680816">We have only the general provision of the Fifth Amendment adopted in 1790 that Congress shall not deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.853" offset="14735360">A provision made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.620" offset="14766393">Perhaps, it may be said that the concept to due process of law does not provide standards for the guidance of the Courts on this question and is not nourish for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.910" offset="14811638">However, it is clearly a very general concept and it would be at least surprising if it was found to have a meaning today which no one had ever conceive it had a doing the first 175 years or so of its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.748" offset="14890945">Of course, I’m familiar with Holmes statement that it’s revolving to have no better reason for a rule of law than so it was in the time of Henry II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.798" offset="14931174">But it is also equally true I think that it is at least surprising to find things in the Constitution today which no one dreamed were there as recently as five years ago and with which we live for 175 years without even raising the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.029" offset="15016020">Theoretically, I supposed a requirement that there must be legislative standards for jury sentencing and murder cases would be equally applicable to jury sentencing in non-capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.237" offset="15072862">And the fourth of our states have extensive jury sentencing in non-capital cases doesn’t particularly appeal to me but it also it seems to me to be the sort of thing which the States ought to be free to determine in their own way and it would apply indeed it seems to me the sentencing by a judge in capital and non-capital cases and as suggested by counsel for California to parole boards and I can’t find any theoretical reason why it wouldn’t be equally applicable to the action of the Governor or the President in extending Executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.986" offset="15235866">It is clear though that jury sentencing in non-capital cases predated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.219" offset="15264810">There was no jury sentencing in capital cases at that time because they all carried the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.990" offset="15299918">As a matter of fact, the problem we have here is -- has a great deal of background behind it very early in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.138" offset="15340460">There were efforts to mitigate the harshness of the unvarying death penalty for serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.627" offset="15374420">It was on 1794 that Pennsylvania adopted the device of dividing murder in the two degrees one with the death penalty and the other covering murders where the extreme penalty was thought unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.480" offset="15445891">Over the years, this solution was adopted in nearly every state but it was soon found that the degree system though helpful was too rigid and mechanical and that indeed is a part of the problem with so-called standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.708" offset="15518824">It could not take care of all the variations or new answers all the factors that might be relatively involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.828" offset="15551216">There were pressures on the jury system and jury sometimes felt forced to reach verdicts of acquittal though guilt had been proved because they felt the penalty was too severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.801" offset="15599177">An effort to meet this problem took the form of introduction of jury discretion as to the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.296" offset="15625091">The first statute of this sort was in Tennessee in 1838, a 132 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.811" offset="15651213">That statute provided no standards and no one of the statute subsequently enacted has undertaken to provide standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.885" offset="15683500">Such statute has now been past in one form or another and every one of the 46 dates which have the death penalty and in relevant acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.638" offset="15726550">Moreover, these statutes have been repeatedly before the courts and the courts including this Court had repeatedly sustained them often with illusions to the fact that the determination of the penalty lay within the complete discretion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.270" offset="15793006">The contention for standards in this field is I think essentially diversionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.446" offset="15817770">It is really a part of an attack on the death penalty itself that is surely understandable and it’s a wholly appropriate matter for the consideration of the legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.566" offset="15870224">But beyond that, I think that the contention is essentially illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.907" offset="15899585">In one guise it would simply call for the proliferation of the definitions of the degrees of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.509" offset="15929992">Long experience is already shown that this is too rigid, too mechanical that it leads indeed to resolves that are harsher than the community as prepared to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.450" offset="15977744">If by standards it is meant that these are factors which the jury is to take into consideration and reaching its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.064" offset="16012225">All of the evidence and experiences that this just what juries do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.791" offset="16035109">There is no reason to think that property selected juries today do not approach it this task conscientious then thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.088" offset="16076278">Though their standards may not be wholly articulated, they are in fact the standards of the community and that is what the jury is for and careful inquiries have shown that this is what juries in fact do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.006" offset="16140016">Further specification in detail would probably not have much effect since juries as representatives of the community do in fact, taken to account the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that I included in the best know formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.916" offset="16223608">The chief, one of this is the list of aggravating and mitigating factors in the American Law Institutes draft of a Model Penal Code and none of which have been adopted in any state though many other provisions of that proposal have been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.167" offset="16300617">This is a little like the problem of defining insanity and instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.560" offset="16326217">This is a great question on which much psychiatric, academic and judicial time and energy had been spent but has never seem to me that the exact definition made much difference and no matter what the formulation is, the jury knows that its task is to determine whether this particular defendant under the circumstances appearing in this case should be held to be responsible for what he has done in the light of general standards of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.000" offset="16455993">Moreover, the specification of these aggravating and mitigating circumstances would and all likelihood lead to harsher verdicts rather than more lenient ones, in so far as the specification of standards had any effect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.863" offset="16523389">Murder and first-degree murder is all we are talking about is inevitably a grisly business and any murder there will be circumstances within the aggravation list as the counsel for California has pointed out that was true and every one of a 128 murder cases in that state in the past five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.439" offset="16613669">If and every murder trial, these aggravating circumstances are put before the jury as one of the matters which as a matter of law they are to take into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.660" offset="16662570">The conscientious jury, recognizing the presence of this aggravation in this case will find it more difficult to reach a lenient verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.107" offset="16704366">We will have, I suspect, in many cases a request on behalf of defendants to omit all charge as to standards and to leave the matter to the judgment and discretion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.627" offset="16766433">Opposition to capital punishment is surely understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.652" offset="16786599">But as long as it is the law of a land, the mitigating provisions develop in the law over many years first, the establishment of degrees of murder and second, discretion in the jury as the people surrogate to fix the penalty of life imprisonment rather than at death should not be found to violate the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.354" offset="16885342">This is a resolution of an extraordinarily difficult problem which has been brought over many years with surprising unanimity at legislative and judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.708" offset="16930795">Our present solution has been devise with great care and thought by the very processes which may and all fairness be called, the due processes of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.411" offset="16981577">Adoption of the petitioner’s contentions here is unwarranted both practically and theoretically and would in fact be illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.903" offset="17015536">The ultimate solution of this problem is a matter for the judgment of the representatives of the people in their legislatures.</text>

            <text syncTime="4324.436" offset="17297659">But I just got my copy this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.104" offset="17304346">I didn’t -- Perhaps, I was confused by the fact that the (Inaudible) of time didn’t permit the printer to send proof to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.615" offset="17334439">So, you may find a couple of typos and I’m sure you’ll find some awkwardness of language that might have been ironed out that I have approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.379" offset="17377489">In any event, there are two or three preliminary matters referred to by the State of California that I think I should mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.986" offset="17423882">Whether this case will affect the faith of some 550 other prisoners is the fact that none of us I suppose can escape considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.232" offset="17488875">In the cases of those 550 or very likely most of them, whether this case will affect them or not will depend pretty largely on the decision that is ultimately laid as to whether this case assuming a result favorable to the present petitioner would have retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.593" offset="17574348">I mentioned that for only one reason, this is McGautha’s first time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.655" offset="17598589">He is still on direct review of his original sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.180" offset="17616666">There is no question or element or retroactivity that needs to be decided so far as he is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.212" offset="17644774">And I submit with all the earnestness that I can, that not withstanding the traditional processes by which a determination between two individuals or between the state and an individual may have an effect upon the law generally and have an effect upon the cases abolished cannot implicate McGautha’s constitutional right whatever they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.749" offset="17762952">It is no approval necessarily either by counsel or by the court of the crime of which McGautha was found guilty to determine that he is entitled to be found guilty and entitled to be sent to his doom if it all, only by the processes of law required by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.475" offset="17853858">And that is what he sees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.672" offset="17866606">Now, reference has been made by the Attorney General of California to the number of reversals that have emanated from the Supreme Court of California in death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.449" offset="17917701">It’s true there have been a pretty large percentage of reversals, none of them for reasons involving anything that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.232" offset="17956885">We have as Your Honors are certainly aware from reading California’s brief and reading our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.535" offset="17990113">We have in California something called the Morris Rule which prohibits argument or evidence about what the Adult Authority may do in the way of paroling a life termer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.795" offset="18039118">Most, not most of those reversals with a very large part of them went off on that particular local rule of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.129" offset="18072451">A great many of them went of on Witherspoon grounds after this Court came down with Witherspoon and may I say they went all upon Witherspoon grounds somewhat grudgingly so far as the Supreme Court of California was concerned but nevertheless they went off from those.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.561" offset="18134204">Nothing in that series of reversal has anything would ever to do with a proposition that the absence of standards nevertheless assures a defendant but the question of his penalty will be decided by the law rather than by the personal reactions of the jurors unguided and uncontrolled.</text>

            <text syncTime="4605.809" offset="18423223">And that I suggest that is the important thing about standards for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.808" offset="18439210">Instead of living them completely at large, it tells them, “These are the things you want to be thinking about and deciding whether to put this man to death or to give him a life term just to say are told in the case of guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="4662.089" offset="18648294">I myself so far as my own thinking on the subject concern have somewhat taken by the approach of the American Law Institute which is much more specific and yet flexible enough than the approach that I have taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="4751.694" offset="19006694">I just know an answer to my brother Black, you said repeated two or three times that the jury should be told, “This is what you ought to be thinking about in deciding whether or not to impose a death sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.523" offset="19050057">Well, that’s one kind of standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.122" offset="19060402">Another, quite different kind and it is different in kind, not in degree is that the jury must be told, “You may not sentence this man to death unless you find this and that and the other or unless you find the absence of this or that and the other.”</text>
