            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="30.957" offset="227244">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.582" offset="249710">This case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit raises a fundamental question as to the legal status of taxes which an employer withholds from the wages of his employees and specifically the case raises the proper treatment of those withheld funds in the event that the employer becomes bankrupt or in is to a Bankruptcy Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.682" offset="350124">The facts of the case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.663" offset="362036">Halo Metal Products, Inc. filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act and that is the provision which allows operation of the business to try to stow up the Bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.951" offset="415222">It was allowed by the referee of the Bankruptcy Court to remain in possession of the business and to carry on the business' operation subject to the referee supervision during the Chapter XI arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.340" offset="460779">As is the custom in such an arrangement, the referee entered in elaborate order requiring the debtor in possession to file periodic reports and to maintain full records of its operations during the arrangement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.837" offset="514696">And in addition, the referee ordered the debtor to open up three bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.564" offset="529638">First of these accounts was to receive all revenues, received by the business during the operation in the arrangement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.365" offset="560880">And the second account was to receive periodically from the funds deposited in the first revenues account the amount necessary to pay all employee wages and disbursements from this payroll account were to be made at proper intervals with the approval of the referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.202" offset="632142">The referee ordered that simultaneously with meeting the debtor in possession's payroll obligations that the debtor deposit into a third special account the amount of tax and social security deductions that the debtor was required to withhold from his employee's wages and withdrawals from this third account were to be allowed only for payment of withheld taxes and welfare benefits as those payments became due to United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.110" offset="747813">The debtor failed almost entirely to comply with the referee's orders with the orders of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to this withheld taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.351" offset="780727">Although the income in social security taxes were withheld from the employee wages, the withheld funds were not placed in the special account nor would they pay over the United States at the proper time as required by the arrangement court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.531" offset="841540">During the arrangement, the United Stats filed the proof of claim for payment of a thousand and seventy-five dollars that is $1,075 of FICA in income taxes withheld from employees salaries on the ground that this amount was a special trust for the United States benefit under Section 7501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and about the Section, I shall elaborate shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.064" offset="947597">Subsequently, about three months after the filing of the original arrangement petition, Halo was adjudicated a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.640" offset="977899">In a month later on December 22, 1967, the United States filed the petition in the Bankruptcy Proceeding asking that the withheld taxes at which it claim as the Trust Fund under Section 7501 be paid over to the United States just as any Trust Fund would be paid over prior to payment of the cost and expenses of administration of the Bankruptcy Proceeding and the referee denied the Government's petition, the District Court and the COurt of Appeals upheld the referee's denial of the petition and it is that which we are here on the writ of certiorari to contest now.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.371" offset="1116871">Both of these courts held essentially that Halo's obligation to pay over to the Government the taxes withheld from employee wages was merely an administrative expense of the bankrupt estate and was thereby subject to the scale of priorities established by Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act with which I am sure this Court is quite familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.995" offset="1199313">And I think it would be helpful to view the issue presented here which is whether the Government is entitled to recognition of a trust fund for the amount of taxes withheld from the salaries of the bankrupt's employees during the arrangement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.660" offset="1258036">As breaking down essentially into two parts, two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.750" offset="1274337">The first question is and this is as really the question is construed by the Court of Appeals whether the trust fund concept is simply inapplicable altogether as both courts below seemed to have felt in a Bankruptcy Proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.243" offset="1340374">And the second question which neither court reached but which I believe was the focus of the bankruptcy referee's decision is whether assuming that the trust does not disappear merely by virtue of the withholding employer's bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.148" offset="1399933">Whether the trust is nonetheless defeated or enjoinment of the trust is defeated by virtue of the Government's inability to trace the race of the trust and I will address myself to both of these questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.481" offset="2085282">That is the question in this case as we view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.984" offset="2099284">But that is not the question as Court of Appeals viewed it and I think it is very important to see exactly how the Court of Appeals did identify this question and to make sure that what I consider the gross misconception on the Court of Appeals opinion be corrected.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="514.496" offset="2161351">But on your theory, this statute along with the order of the court impresses a constructive trust on the total receipts of the bankrupt and regards him as having done what he had been ordered to do, is that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="536.190" offset="2248182">That's exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.787" offset="2254555">It's exactly right Mr. Chief Justice that is our theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.890" offset="2266885">And that is the theory of Professor Scott and that is the theory of all the courts which have directed themselves to this aspect of the case and the theory which these courts have gone on and ever since we've gotten into this, I might as well anticipate what I expected to be a later stage of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.769" offset="2338461">The theory that these courts have gone upon is that yes, in a situation where the raise of a trust cannot be traced where you are simply talking about general assets, it is you run a risks in either imposing the trust or disregarding the trust you run a risks that loss in the -- that the actual proceeds have been lost in the accounting procedure, there is no record to say where the assets went and so that either the trustee, either the beneficiary of the trust or the general creditors may have suffered in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.327" offset="2464684">Now, this seems to me the most likely assumption is that the estate has been fattened by the failure to pay over these funds at the designated time.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.233" offset="2504286">And though we want to protect the creditors with respect to the general assets, the estate has been the view of all the courts that have considered this.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.798" offset="2538559">That because of the fact that the referee, the debtor in possession is himself an officer of the bankruptcy court and because the debtor in possession is the person who buy his negligence failed to segregate these funds and failed to setup the trust for the benefit of the Government that we ought not to make the beneficiary of a trust suffer because of the negligence of an officer of the Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.748" offset="2650363">We ought to give that a beneficiary the right to rely on the fact that an officer of the Bankruptcy Court is going to do what the Bankruptcy Court tells him to particularly when the Bankruptcy Court states in the order that it shall supervise all these operations on a weekly or monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.025" offset="2723506">So that all have -- all who have considered this question have felt that the equitable considerations which militate in favor of recognizing this right to rely on the Bankruptcy Court doing what it says its going to do should eliminate the requirement of tracing the raise of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.192" offset="2808142">But I want also to make clear is that this is not the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.665" offset="2826010">This issue which I consider to be the crucial issue of the case is not the issue that the courts below went upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.976" offset="2847326">The courts below in my opinion fundamentally misconstrued the whole nature of withheld taxes and the interrelation of the bankruptcy Act with this trust fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.500" offset="3641344">Now, let us consider the case of the employees -- of the employer's insolvency and look briefly at Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act which is set forth in relevant part of page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.936" offset="3683140">That Section entitled “Debts which have Priority” establishes those debts of the bankrupt which have priority over general unsecured creditors in the Bankruptcy Proceeding and that Section reads as follows, “The debts to have priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment, shall be (1) the costs and expenses of administration including the actual and necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate subsequent to filing the petition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="926.263" offset="3808423">And then follows a general enumeration of expenses considered to be administrative expenses of the bankrupt estate followed by four other categories of debts which have priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.425" offset="3849070">And I note in that regard just for the sake of clarity that the fourth category of Debts with Priority includes “taxes which became legally due knowing by the Bankrupt to the United States or to any State or any subdivision thereof” and this priority for tax debts includes essentially tax debts which are incurred by the employer prior to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings and it is not disputed that tax debts incurred by the bankrupt during the bankruptcy proceeding are administrative expenses of the bankrupt estate in sharing the first priority but that would not in our view include these taxes for the reason I am about to state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.175" offset="4904103">He holds it for a brief period of time and is required to pay it over and it's my submission to this Court that regardless of how strong a policy Section 64, The Bankruptcy Act embodies this to the equal priority of administrative expenses does nothing in that provision which converts trust funds into administrative expenses or which deals in any way with the bankrupt's obligation to handle the funds which it is receive in the capacity of collection agent and neither of the Court's below nor the respondent trustee has attempted to answer this what I considered to be a crucial threshold question of what interplay it all to Section 64 have on this funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.643" offset="5513906">I want to point out that the Court in the Nicholas case cited the sentence of Section 7501 and I think it is important since no doubt the Nicholas case will -- does have to be examined to determine the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.024" offset="5587466">The second sentence of Section 7501 after the trust is declared says as follows, the withheld taxes shall be “assessed, collected, and paid” in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitation including penalties as are applicable with respect to the taxes from such fund arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.573" offset="5665625">Now we think that as we've discussed in our brief that the legislative history of that statute makes it clear that it was not designed really though it says limitations, it was not designed to limit remedies but to expand Government revenues but even the quoted language taken at its face value is I think of anything favorable to our position in this case because the phrase “taxes from which such fund arose” clearly refers to the income and social security taxes owed by the employees and withheld by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.985" offset="5791326">And these taxes on the employees would not subject to any collection limitation by virtue of the employer's bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.668" offset="5826017">Now they would be subject in any bankruptcy proceeding to a limitation on the accrual of interests during the bankruptcy proceeding but they would not be subject to a limitation by virtue of the employer's bankruptcy and there and I think lies the essential distinction even given the fact that the Court relied on the second sentence of Section 7501 in the Nicholas case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.309" offset="7524603">The Government seems to be relying rather heavily upon the trust fund theory and the theory of trust and trust ex mal officio and question why the Seventh Circuit Court did not address itself to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.644" offset="7593984">And I think it's very obvious that the reason why the Seventh Circuit Court did not address itself to this particular argument of the Government, is that it wasn't necessary for it to do so because the court there interpreted Section 64 (a) to the same as the Connecticut General case did and the same as the Green case is that number one, they were not in conflict with one another that Section 7501 (a) and 64 (a) (1) could be read separately and by the second sentence in 7501 (a), it provided that the trust have the same limitations on it as the taxes from which the fund arose and then went on to say that the taxes arose from and by virtue with the Bankruptcy Act and therefore the Bankruptcy Act would prevail and there goes Section 64 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.784" offset="7838490">But further, if these were not the case, that the strong policy of 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act would prevail over the general provisions and the general policy of Section 7501.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.946" offset="7895124">I would like to review rather briefly the history of these cases starting out with the Guaranty Title Company case, an opinion in 1912 where the Section 3466 of the Internal Revenue Code provided for a priority as opposed to 7501 which provides for trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.880" offset="7978924">There the Supreme Court held that it was a beneficent policy that 64 (a) should prevail especially in that case that pertain to wage earners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.884" offset="8026885">This was reaffirmed by this Court in Davis versus Pringle in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.266" offset="8052485">Now, this line of cases goes undisturbed up until the time of U.S. versus Nicholas or Nicholas versus U.S. which was decided in this Court in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.031" offset="8099506">The problem arises with the line of cases under the City of New York versus Rassner and then the Rassner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.287" offset="8124479">The first case in 1942 in which this trust fund was found to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.841" offset="8146735">The Rassner case provided or the Rassner case said that it was a general provision of the Bankruptcy Act in Section 64 (a) as opposed to the specific provisions of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.795" offset="8214549">And the Rassner case went on to say that if it could be shown that the policy or if the provisions of 64 (a) were other than general then the result would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.444" offset="8269197">And this Court has shown in Nicholas versus United States in express language said that it is a strong policy that prevails in 64 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.109" offset="8307858">That being the case than the perhaps fall from underneath the Rassner case and all of the cases that follow it fall like dominoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.804" offset="8346624">This is the theory of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.219" offset="8364283">This has been the position of the trustee from its very -- the very inception of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.871" offset="8406810">In the Nicholas case, the Court went so far as to say that the taxes that were incurred during the Chapter XI, and this is precisely what we're talking about here, come within the first priorities of Section 64, the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.763" offset="8466474">That is the cost of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.873" offset="8486849">The history of the administrative and cost of administration provisions of the Bankruptcy Act have constantly worked towards allowance across of administration and the way from tax collecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.706" offset="8550170">When you trace the history in the Bankruptcy Act is enacted in 1800 and 1841, 1867 and 1898.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.802" offset="8586533">All gave top priority to taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.489" offset="8597295">It wasn't until 1926 that the priorities were changed, the cost of administration was advanced and that the taxes were reduced to a sixth priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.515" offset="8637419">Then under the Chandler Act of 1938, the system of priorities was retained and further the tax collector was further restricted but being required to file this claim within the limitation set on all other claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.492" offset="8717354">And again in 1952, the Act was again amended to give further priority to cost of administration by providing that cost of administration in a superseding bankruptcy takes priority over the cost of administration in the superseded chapter proceedings, further strengthening the position of cost of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.004" offset="8823411">And lastly in 1966, the most recent amendment which changed the priorities further or limited further the claim for taxes by holding that the taxes could only be claimed for a three-year period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.824" offset="8894673">So we see historically, this picture of the reducing of the tax claim in advancing the cost of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.397" offset="8932916">And I think as the court below in the very scholarly opinion by Mr. Justice Hastings points out and refers to the congressional or rather the Senate Reports and the House Conference Reports as it apply to the cost of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.838" offset="9018702">And the need to preserve this cost of administration because let's take just what could happen very easily in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.511" offset="9065409">We are only -- the Government is only seeking to impress the trust on those taxes that were collected by the debtor in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.659" offset="9098010">But if you were to read Section 7501 that says any person who collects taxes that would also mean the bankrupt prior to filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.549" offset="9149524">Further and following the Rassner line of cases, if you have every state and every municipality enacting trust fund legislation, there's nothing left to administer in these cases or were still, you have a trustee who is going to wait and to see if anyone is going to assert his trust rights and the estate is going to go unadministered during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.389" offset="9260910">And as the House Reports and the House Conference Report and the Senate Report, I believe it was in the 82nd Congress emphasized the necessity to protect the trustee in order to have orderly administration of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.598" offset="9325798">If you don't protect the trustee, if you don't give him the first priority, then you are not going to have orderly administration of estate just the normal routine that's employed by the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.734" offset="9378356">First of all, he ceases the property in order to protect it and so doing here immediately in first liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.164" offset="9404061">He's got to post the bond as required by Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.943" offset="9415137">He's got to assume rent liabilities for use in occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.595" offset="9429765">He's got to employ inventory clerks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.122" offset="12767901">There is a report filed after the institution of liquid -- of the applicable liquidation have occurred which refers to a special account in a bank of special tax account but the referee specifically found and I guess this is the facts for the purposes of this case that no such moneys have in fact been entered and it's unclear from the little record we have about this $200 to $300 that it was in fact a special Government account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.730" offset="12874271">And I would say that for purposes of this case, we have to assume that that we're going simply at the general funds of this estate in imposing the trust with respect to those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.517" offset="12913455">I want to say in conclusion only that, I think that respondent's argument in this case merely affirms my prior statement that neither the courts below nor the respondent have dealt with the issue of what is the nature of these debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.571" offset="12989628">Are they tax debts of the employer owed to the Government or does the employer hold them merely as collecting agent for debts of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.235" offset="13024319">I don't see on the theory of that either the court below or respondent has gone on how they would recognize this trust fund even if the amounts -- the proper amounts have been segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.906" offset="13071026">It seems to me that under their theory which precludes operation of 7501 trust when a Bankruptcy Proceedings starts, the trustee would not have been authorized to pay over segregated funds even if he had segregated them because they simply would he no trust in the time of bankruptcy and that is a totally unacceptable holding form our point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.174" offset="13272064">There was a fear on Congress' part that absent that ordinary tax remedies would not be available precisely because this was not a tax debt of the bankrupt and the Congress wanted all available procedural remedies, trust, tax, and debt to be --</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.682" offset="13410095">I believe this case is distinguishable because even though interests would have been precluded on any debt -- tax debt including the employee's tax debts and a Bankruptcy Proceeding, the employee's tax debts would at no time have been subjected to collecting limitation of being placed in the bankrupt employer's estate and his funds available to general creditors.</text>
