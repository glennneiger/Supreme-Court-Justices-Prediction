            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="15.581" offset="165700">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.617" offset="181791">This is a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.293" offset="220557">That Court struck down a major provision of the District of Columbia abortion statute on the grounds that it was unconstitutionally vague on it’s face.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.176" offset="284087">Two indictments were returned in the District of Columbia, charging Appellee, Dr. Milan Vuitch who was a licensed physician, with procuring or attempting to procure two abortions in violation of Section 22-201 of the DC Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.519" offset="381471">That Section makes it a crime to procure or attempt to procure an abortion “unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of the mother’s life or health.”</text>
            <text syncTime="86.251" offset="448345">Appellee’s motion to dismiss the indictment was granted before trial by the District Court on the grounds that the quoted phrase was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.918" offset="499022">The record does contain no development whatever of any of the facts bearing on the charges contained in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.220" offset="552208">Our basic position in this Court is that the District Court erred in striking down the abortion statue for vagueness on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.072" offset="595675">The result of the Court’s decision, if allowed to stand, is that there is now no limitation in the District of Columbia on the performance of abortions by physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.475" offset="649279">We believe that under a proper interpretation of the statute, there is a definite class of situations to which the statute can be applied without running into vagueness problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.742" offset="706330">For this reason, we think the case should be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.877" offset="738931">Before reaching the merits of the District Court’s ruling however, there are certain jurisdictional questions, which this Court has requested the parties to brief and argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.329" offset="792639">They are as follows; First, does this Court have jurisdiction over this direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act, not withstanding the fact that the underlying statute applies only within the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.279" offset="868498">Second, could the Government have appealed this case to the Court of Appeals under Section 23-105 of the DC Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.010" offset="911444">That Section gives the Government the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant and third if the Government could have appealed to the Court of Appeals, should this Court, as a matter of sound judicial administration, abstain from accepting jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.787" offset="994513">First, let me point out two significant developments since the time we filed our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.390" offset="1020949">These are the passage of the DC Reform Act and the amendment of the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.847" offset="1050728">Under the DC Court Reform Act which became law, signed into law last July and it becomes effective February 1 of this year, jurisdiction over “any criminal case under any law applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia will by mid 1972 rest in the Superior Court of the District Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.310" offset="1156577">Appeals from that Court will run to the District Court, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which of course is not the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.317" offset="1204642">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is the Court of record and its judgments are reviewed by this Court in the same way that the State Court judgments are reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.568" offset="1257618">Of more immediate impact and perhaps of conclusive impact on direct appeals of course is the amendment of the Criminal Appeals Act which abolishes direct appeals to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.630" offset="1309863">Now, that does not apply -- it applies only to cases begun and by that we mean, we interpret that to mean begun by indictment, after January 2nd of this year when the law was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.029" offset="1371512">So that case does not -- that law does not apply to this case, but the effect of these two laws we submit is to make issues, the jurisdictional issues presented here issues which do not have ongoing significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.484" offset="1469315">Well, turning --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="342.260" stopTime="347.691">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="342.260" offset="1472449">That means there isn’t much difference as a practical matter whether it's state jurisdiction or not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="347.691" stopTime="364.026">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="347.691" offset="1494183">No, I believe it does make a considerable amount of difference whether you take jurisdiction of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.714" offset="1522186">I just mean that the issues you decide here, the jurisdictional issues will not have overriding significance in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.026" offset="1559489">Well, I look too much in my comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.588" offset="1577775">We don’t worry to much about jurisdictional questions, just accept the rest of them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="375.021" offset="1603480">That is the Government’s position, yes sir.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="377.082" stopTime="384.580">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="377.082" offset="1611734">Well, I thought it was that any jurisdictional devision will be of a very limited precedential value in the light of the statutory changes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="384.580" stopTime="420.850">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="384.580" offset="1641723">That is right, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.036" offset="1647470">Well, turning to those issues now, the old act as it applies to this case states that an appeal maybe taken by and on behalf of the United States from the District Courts, direct to the Supreme Court from a decision or judgment dismissing any indictment with such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.850" offset="1786755">I take it, it’s your position that that applies even to a statue restricted in its application to the District of Columbia.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="430.090" stopTime="431.327">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="431.327" stopTime="442.953">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="431.327" offset="1828655">As it stands in contrast to one which is applicable throughout the country in which the normal District Court elsewhere will have to do with?</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="442.953" stopTime="458.114">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="442.953" offset="1875153">That is right, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.119" offset="1879855">We believe that Congress perhaps could have made a distinction between statue applicable only within the District of Columbia and statutes of nationwide application, but the Congress did not make that distinction here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="458.114" stopTime="480.422">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="458.114" offset="1935862">But certainly it is true on the state side, we have entirely separate criminal procedure with channels its way up through the State Supreme Courts and here we have or dealing with a local statue, which conceivably could be argued anyway, should go up to the Court Appeals rather than here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="480.422" stopTime="838.953">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="480.422" offset="2025096">Well, that is certainly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.730" offset="2042337">I think an analogy can be drawn to the review of the challenges of state statutes by a Three-Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.757" offset="2102418">Under that statute, this Court has interpreted the term statute in that Three-Judge District Court provision to mean statute of statewide applicability rather than a local statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.811" offset="2158634">We believe that this distinction was not carried over to the federal area in the case Shapiro against Thompson, involving the welfare residency requirements of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.572" offset="2229687">There this Court interpreted the statute there 28 U.S.C 2282, which said that a Constitutional challenge to an act of Congress applicable only to the District of Columbia must be heard by a Three-Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.841" offset="2306696">This Court decided that any Act of Congress included an Act of Congress limited in application for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.776" offset="2346506">Now I would suggest that at the time of Shapiro that perhaps were arguments for restricting the scope of that phrase, they were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.595" offset="2393736">The Court stated they could see no reason to draw that distinction and we submit that, that is dispositive of this issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.020" offset="2435427">The only other phrase in the old Criminal Appeals Act which we could see would perhaps lead to some doubt as to whether this Court had jurisdiction as the the term District Court as to whether that includes the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.122" offset="2515884">We have nothing to add to what we said in our brief there.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.730" offset="2538245">We concluded in our brief that when the statute was originally passed, it did not include that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.927" offset="2571055">It did not apply to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.499" offset="2589341">It was amended in 1942 to specifically mention the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and it has been interpreted by the Court of Appeals and by this Court that, that amendment had the effect of making the Court of -- the Criminal Appeals Act applicable to the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.353" offset="2672828">We don’t believe that is a substantial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.216" offset="2708250">Well, coming to the second point that is whether this Court has jurisdiction, whether the Government could have taken this case to the Court of Appeals under DC Code Section 23-105.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.925" offset="2775124">I'd point out that that Section has been amended and as of February 1st it is part of the DC Court Reform Act as of February 1st it is now 23-104 and the Section is reworded much more specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.697" offset="2850147">We submit that it doesn’t have a material effect on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.171" offset="2872090">We had assumed at the time we brought appeal here that our only choice was to come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.478" offset="2913259">It was because in Carroll against United States, this Court reviewed the overlap of the Criminal Appeals Act in the DC Appeals Provision and concluded that the explicit directions of the Criminal Appeals Act will apply whether it too might apply to the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.097" offset="3011793">That decision, however, was placed in doubt, that observation was placed in doubt by the decision last spring by this Court in United States against Sweet.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.505" offset="3053380">In that case, the dismissal of an indictment had been appealed to the Court of Appeals under the 23-105.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.920" offset="3103013">The Court of Appeals without determining whether it had jurisdiction certified the case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.490" offset="3129344">This Court determined that certification was inappropriate because the certification provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act were limited to situations where the appeal had been taken to the Court Appeals pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act and so was the case was sent back to the Criminal Appeals Act, but in its opinion this Court noted that the Court of Appeals had not decided whether it had jurisdiction under 23-105, which would at least indicate this Court thought there was a possibility that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.533" offset="3265494">Well, assuming that can be said that, that it can be said that it would, the question then becomes whether this Court should accept jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act, on the standing that both statutes might apply to its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.272" offset="3360475">We submit that because the Criminal Appeals Act states that an appeal maybe taken by the United States to this Court that this is an appeal as of right and this Court lacks discretion to reject --to refuse to take the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.953" offset="3459218">Really argument is not as you just stated that this Court should accept this appeal, but rather that this Court must accept this appeal, is it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="849.356" offset="3500805">And that even though it maybe that you could have appealed to the Court of Appeals to the District to Columbia, nonetheless having appealed here, your submission is, as I understood it from your brief, this Court has no power now to transfer to the Court of Appeals and must accept jurisdiction of this appeal under the (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.358" offset="4436825">This Court has afforded standing in certain First Amendment cases to attack the statute on its face and it’s presumably on these cases that appellee relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.668" offset="4494085">Of course, the leading case in that area is the Dombrowski against Pfister case where a subversive activity statute of Louisiana was struck down by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.655" offset="4565974">We concede of course the point that appellee stresses in his brief that there are many physicians in the District of Columbia who are dissatisfied with the abortion statute and that perhaps many more abortions would be performed if statute did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.932" offset="4651133">But by this concession, we don’t believe that establishes that the rights asserted are of such constitutional significance that the statute should be struck down on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.358" offset="4696795">Just that comparing this case with the Dombrowski, first the constitutional rights asserted here are novel and for the most part unexplored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.918" offset="4831065">In Dombrowski it is very questionable as to whether that statute could be applied to any significant category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.297" offset="4872547">Finally, in Dombrowski the conduct of those challenging the state statute was not at the hardcore type which would be prohibited by any reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.441" offset="4917164">Here, only the development of a record will demonstrate whether appellee’s conduct is at the hardcore type of not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.935" offset="4967111">Assuming, however, that the appellee should be allowed to attack the statute on its face to reach the merits of the District Court’s holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.364" offset="5016848">It is argued that the District Court misconstrued the statute and that under a proper interpretation the statute is not unconstitutional vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.698" offset="5054151">Of great concerned to the District Court was a possibility that a doctor would exercise medical judgment and determine that health grounds justify an abortion and that this judgment would then be subject to being second guessed after the fact by first the prosecutor and then the (Inaudible) the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.583" offset="5173687">This concern follow from the court’s reading of the 1943 decision of the Court of Appeals in Williams against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.614" offset="5205870">The District Court read that case as placing the burden on the physician of persuading the jury that his acts were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.216" offset="5244217">We submit that Williams did not hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.211" offset="5260204">In the William’s case, neither side at his trial, neither side introduced any evidence of justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.453" offset="11049148">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.092" offset="11075688">In large part I believe agrees with the United States with respect to the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.369" offset="11108812">This Court has asked twice in this case whether as a matter of sound judicial administration it should abstain from accepting jurisdiction pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act because the case involves the validity of a statute, the application of which is confined solely to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.952" offset="11195225">Your Honors, the statute certainly contains sufficiently broad language to make it appear, at least facially, that the Government had the right to make the executive choice of brining this case directly to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.473" offset="11273279">If I may I would just like to read the first paragraph, Title 18, U.S.C. 3731, “An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the District Courts direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in all criminal cases in the following instances” and the instance of course of which we in the Government rely jointly is “from a decision or judgment setting aside or dismissing any indictment or information or any count thereof where such decision is based upon invalidity of the construction of the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.947" offset="11431163">So we respectfully suggest to Your Honors that the United States is correct in stating that under the Criminal Appeals Act, the case is here mandatory, but should the court feel that the case is not mandatory before it under the Criminal Appeals Act, we would like to suggest that there are factors other than the scope of applicability of the statute which dictate that the Court should entertain jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.141" offset="11567940">I believe that it is fair statement that this Court should accept jurisdiction by the exercise of its discretion, if nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.829" offset="11610676">What Your Honors have before you today is a matter of landmark and historic importance in the area of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.801" offset="11646621">Whatever merit there might be to a general policy of waiting in event initial decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, I would respectfully suggest Your Honors that there are myriads of cases brewing it the Lower Courts and I'm sure Your Honors are aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.016" offset="11719450">We now have situations where in the state of Wisconsin, a Three-Judge Federal Court has declared the Wisconsin abortion statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.726" offset="12630288">First, I believe that it would be an enormous problem with the judicial administration to deal with every variegated facet of the abortion area on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.286" offset="12688488">That is to say, the authorities which have been decided in our briefs, and in the Government’s brief, the statistics, the material, the medical knowledge, all of it is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.115" offset="12731852">It’s before Your Honors now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.998" offset="12739375">If in each case where a doctor, and I feel strongly that it’s an unjust indictment, a doctor were indicted, we would have to send the case back in order to find out in each instance what his justification was for performing a particular abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.769" offset="12814399">Your Honors would never be able to decide the tremendous variety of instances that occur in medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.091" offset="12847731">So, the first part of my answer is that this is not a subject matter in my humble opinion which can be dealt with on a case to case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.504" offset="12885347">On the second level, I would like to suggest to you Mr. Chief Justice that there is hardly any area of criminal law more unique than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.658" offset="12925994">Here you have a situation in which a woman comes to a doctor and pleads with him to help her medically.</text>

            <text syncTime="3793.692" offset="15278164">I wanted briefly to return and I hope the Court will indulge me when I say that I wanted briefly to return to the question of review because I know that this is troubling the Court and I feel that in some recent cases, this Court has acted in the manner to enhance the prospect of taking jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.068" offset="15383594">In the Sisson case, which this Court decided in June of 1970, review was denied because in that case as I recall it, it was a motion in arrest of judgment which the Judge Wisesky in Boston had granted in connection with a selective service case, but I’m very impressed with the fact that in both the majority opinion and the dissent, this Court states that if a statute is unclear and as ambiguous as the Criminal Appeals Act, which Your Honors will not have to contend with after the effective date on January 2 anymore, the words of the statute are the only the first place to begin interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.883" offset="15578885">And I would say that on the face of the statute on the Carroll – on the face of the Carroll opinion and the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that this Court mandatorily should take jurisdiction and that if there’s any doubt in this Court’s mind, it should exercise discretion in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3903.034" offset="15715558">May it please the Court, I would like to return to the language of the statute that Mr. -- that Judge Gesell found to be unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.989" offset="15759339">Now, we’d like to emphasize in turning to the words of the statute that this is the only case we know of in which the professional judgment of a physician is being second guessed by the police, by a judge or jury in the exercise of his medical judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.024" offset="15823496">But the language of the statutes permits an abortion to be made, if it’s necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.201" offset="15864142">In our position, every term in that statute is impermissibly vague and cannot support the criminal indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.264" offset="15896430">The word “preserve” was discussed at great length in the Bello’s opinion in the California Supreme Court in which Judge Peters in the first case reaching the conclusion of the statute of this kind was unconstitutionally vague, pointed out that can be subjected to at least two meanings, preserving life or a health in the abstract or maintaining the status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.104" offset="15991829">Well, it can be interpreted to mean that the doctor is attempting to preserve the life of this particular individual as distinguished from the person’s health at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.642" offset="16065912">The word “necessary” was commented on by Chief Justice Taft as long ago as 1926 in the Trinidad case which is quoted in our brief, in which he said it’s a word of great indefiniteness and it’s objectionable in a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.592" offset="16121710">The phrase “necessary to preserve life” taken in this statute as in many other statutes that have been ruled upon by District Courts and Supreme Courts throughout country, lay down no standard by which the term can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.337" offset="16184717">Does the phrase “necessary to preserve life” mean that it is likely that death will occur, that death is eminent, that death is possible?</text>

            <text syncTime="4055.370" offset="16324838">The legislative history is of no help and there are at least seven courts in this country that have already held that similar language is unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.531" offset="16365484">Most of those are cited in the brief, some have been decided in the succeeding months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.531" offset="16397458">Judges in a variety of Courts have pointed out the anomalous and indeed indefensible position that physicians are placed under statutes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.512" offset="16449390">For example, one Judge said this would place the physician in the position of saying to his patient that in the exercise of his best medical judgment an abortion was advisable, but that the law prevented him from performing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.189" offset="16512084">Judge Neville, in an earlier stage of the case that Mr. Justice Blackmun referred to, said in a concurring opinion, the case itself went off on the jurisdictional ground, but Judge Neville said I subscribe to the view that the entire medical profession an innumerable pregnant women live under sword of damocles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.902" offset="16599019">The exercise of their best medical judgment, the giving of advice and the pregnant women’s freedom of choice is chilled by the cloud of a statute which renders their actions illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.966" offset="16643218">Similar language, similar conclusions can be found in several other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.473" offset="16669236">Now if the word “life” which has been the subject of most of the decisions to date is vague 'necessary to preserve life,” the word “health” is innumerably vaguer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.051" offset="16715525">There is no possible standard that can be derived from the language of the statute it seems to us which can give meaning and concreteness to that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.207" offset="16752201">What does it mean to say that there is a risk to the health of the patient?</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.703" offset="16770173">How great must be the danger be is one taken to effect the nature of the operation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.430" offset="16797132">What is the relevance of the person’s mental health, the effect upon her family, upon her marriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.559" offset="16825657">In this connection I would merely refer to at recent article which appeared in the Alabama Law Review in the summer of 1970, it’s not sited in the brief, but an article by Clifton Meder, the Dean of the Alabama Medical School and titled “The Mind of the Physician” pointed out to a legal audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.993" offset="16915310">Uncertainty is the part of the life of every physician and he goes on to give numerous examples of how its impossible frequently for diagnosis, for medical judgment to be solidly based.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.591" offset="16973720">He gives numerous examples of situations where precision is low in his language and error is likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.200" offset="17000155">Then he goes on to say, unfortunately often in his own apprised medical uncertainty, medicine and law are brought together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.023" offset="17035473">What may appear to be negligence to a patient or lawyer may in fact be the reasonable decisions of a physician dealing with a large amount of uncertainty, either in a diagnosis or the treatment of a disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="4260.893" offset="17146964">It raises the question whether or not a physician is living up to the standards of his profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.794" offset="17166503">In this case, we have a criminal statute which forces him to guess what the word “health” means and it puts him in a wholly different position for a man who is being judged against the standard of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.203" offset="17224182">For example in this case, just to amplify that point, there is no suggestion as far as I know that Dr. Vuitch did not live up to the standards of his profession in terms of care, in terms of exercise of the normal physician’s skills.</text>
