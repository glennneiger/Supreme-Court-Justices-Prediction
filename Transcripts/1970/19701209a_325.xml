            <text syncTime="40.110" offset="263816">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.120" offset="275832">This is a petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by Louis Negre.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.438" offset="305089">Louis Negre is a young man who is a Catholic conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.410" offset="332988">He sought discharge from the United States Armed Forces when he was assigned to serve in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.319" offset="364648">And his application for conscientious objection discharge having been denied by the army on the grounds that was based on personal moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.872" offset="414908">He was assigned to go to Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.897" offset="426924">So, in this case there is no question that the war in which he was asked to serve was the war to which he objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.929" offset="455137">He had standing to object to serving in that particular war, to which he was assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.345" offset="480737">He sought his writ of habeas corpus before Judge Zirpoli in San Francisco, to restrain the army from shipping him to Vietnam to take part in that war and to be discharged as a religious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.305" offset="540609">Judge Zirpoli denied his application for habeas corpus on grounds set out in his opinion and in the course of argument, he made the observation, “that even if my client Mr. Negre were willing to serve in United States, but under the common law concept, he would be aiding and abetting the war.”</text>
            <text syncTime="132.357" offset="632769">My client relied however, on the concept that was traditional in the law and also in logic between approximate and remote participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.659" offset="674043">He indicated that he'll do a practical distinction that he would not participate in any form in the war, but like the man in Kansas who was against World War II, and he was a railroad switchman, he did not decline to flip the switches when the railroad troop trains came through and that was charged against him that he was willing to participate in war.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.218" offset="780204">Of course, it would be nonsense to say that a man has to close his eyes when the troop train goes by or else he is participating in war.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.298" offset="812596">There is a distinction between non-participation and participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.484" offset="829315">My client refused to participate and refused to participate in Vietnam.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.737" offset="1062327">If that were the case, Your Honor, the army's answer to that in Judge Zirpoli's court was they had no provision for canceling his assignment to Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.550" offset="1097540">On the pragmatic side, the army puts the practicalities contrary to what the Solicitor general does.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.566" offset="1121677">It says, we don't have any form of duty, where a man can say, I'll serve here, but I won't serve there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.598" offset="7505795">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.910" offset="7514990">Before opening my argument in this case, I would like to clarify two things which came up in the previous argument and which are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.422" offset="7569011">Mr. Justice Harlan referred to a fact that there is in the statute, a reference to a purely personal moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.327" offset="7608717">I was a little vague in my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.855" offset="7622823">I now had a chance to find the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.030" offset="7635466">It is in the appendix to the petitioner's brief in this case, the Negre case on page 1a at the back, “and nothing contained in this Title shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States, who by a reason by religious training and belief is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form,” and then comes this sentence which was unfortunately omitted in the printing of our brief, “as used in this sub-section, the term religious training and belief does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.534" offset="7797530">It was because the way the statute has put it as the definition of religious training and belief which we are not questioning here, rather than as having something to do with that participation in war in any form that I omitted it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.128" offset="7863881">Formally, verbally that's the way it is limited.Practically, it seems to me to give some indication of what Congress was trying to get at in formulating the provision itself and then there was a question to me as to whether Congress had ever refused to allow conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.611" offset="7945801">This is covered on pages 34 to 36 of the supplement to the brief which we filed in the Welsh case which we printed the brief in the Seeger case which gave a detailed treatment of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.809" offset="8006614">The fact is that at the beginning of the Civil War, military service was a state matter and you will remember, it was always the 7th Massachusetts in the 23rd Ohio and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.165" offset="8047992">Thereafter, Congress said and some states had conscientious objector provisions and others had different ones, thereafter Congress provided for a draft, but at the beginning it provided that you could provide substitutes and a great many of the conscientious objectors apparently provided substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.300" offset="8124583">Finally, thereafter, during the Civil War, Congress enacted the statute which was typical of the form right down through the World War II, “that members of religious denominations who shall by oath or affirmation declare that they are conscientiously opposed to the bearing of arms and who are prohibited from doing so by the rules and the articles of faith and practice of said religious denominations shall when drafted into the military service, be considered non-combatants and shall be assigned by the Secretary of War to duty in the hospitals or to the care of freed men or shall pay the sum of $300 to such persons as the Secretary of War shall designate to receive it, to be applied to the benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.650" offset="8321964">Provided no person shall be entitled to the benefits of the provision to this Section, unless his declaration of conscientious scruples against bearing arms shall be supported by satisfactory evidence that his department has been uniformly consistent with such declaration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.579" offset="8389674">Now turning to this case, I think though it is someways more complicated, it presents essentially the same legal issue as the preceding case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.331" offset="8652675">I am not an expert on it, but it is insofar as I understand it, it is the doctrine of the Catholic Church that there is a distinction between just and unjust wars which has a theological significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.275" offset="8720488">However, the Church as I understand it does not make that choice for the individual, and that choice I suggest is on a different level, and the determination of the Church between just and unjust wars, that choice is a personal choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.855" offset="8778794">And if the individual's choice is a selective conscientious objection, he is not covered by the statute anymore than is a Quaker who might make the same choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.903" offset="8819022">A Quaker -- the quaker religion, insofar as it is formalized is opposed to war in any form, but there are many good Quakers who have served in wars, Powell Douglas served actively in World War II, Herbert Hoover was Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy and if a Quaker says, yes, I understand that's the teaching of my Church, but as far as I am concerned it's a selective matter, I will serve in some wars and not in other wars, then he would not be covered by this statute either.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.970" offset="10099231">Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that's what I have been trying to say whether it is religious or not, if it selective, it (A) doesn't come within the statute, and (B) there is nothing in the constitution which requires Congress to recognize it or putting it another way, it does not amount to an establishment of religion or a denial of the free exercise of a religion which is all that the First Amendment covers, nor is it invidious discrimination, insofar as there is an equal protection concept in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.696" offset="10230157">Now it's already been pointed out that this case is different from Gillette case since it arises in habeas corpus and is not a criminal case, this I don't think makes any significant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.311" offset="10292642">It is based on a directive of the department of defense and army regulations which provide for release of people on the basis of conscientious objection, and they shall be judged according to the regulation by the same standards, whether made before or after entering Military service, and that these shall be the selective service system standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.908" offset="10399013">Thus Section 6 (j) is incorporated into the relevant military regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.188" offset="10428165">I do think it is pertinent to point out again, as has been asserted, as has been stated here by Mr. Harrington that the petitioner is no longer on active duty in the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.323" offset="10484694">He has been transferred to the ready reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.690" offset="10502144">He can quite readily within the conscientious scruples which he showed during the four months that he was in the army, where he was willing to serve in uniform on this side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.891" offset="10554911">He can quite readily comply with the military requirement, which seem to me that if he doesn't, it is simply a clear case of military disobedience which ought to be treated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.303" offset="10620635">If he does feel that his views have now changed, so that he is opposed to participation in war any form, he is still entitled to file a claim based upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.884" offset="10662954">I do not understand that he has ever made any such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.059" offset="10691584">Now, the other difference between this case and the Gillette case as already pointed out, is that the objection in the present case has a clear religious basis within the conventional sense of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.756" offset="10766399">Now the petitioner is a Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.871" offset="10774862">He based his application on well known writings of traditional Catholic authors, including the present Pope and his predecessor Pope John XXIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.062" offset="10819584">And on the basis of these writings he says, that each Catholic must form his own conscience in respect of military service, and that there is a distinction between just and unjust wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.909" offset="10870993">On this basis, he concludes that he cannot conscientiously participate in the war in Vietnam, although he would be prepared to perform noncombatant hospital service in the United States, because such service is not directly in aid of the army in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.690" offset="10946121">The hearing officer found that he was a devout Catholic, who sincerely believed that the war in Vietnam was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.283" offset="10980498">He concluded, however, that the application for discharge should be rejected because in his opinion, the applicant objected to a particular war and not to war in any form, and this was supported by the Department of the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.159" offset="11051969">The District Court in the habeas corpus proceeding, Pages 47 and 48 of the Appendix, read the or recited the opinion of the hearing officer and concluded that it is a fact when considered together with other facts disclosed in the record, including the timing of the application and petitioner's request for noncombatant status, with the restriction that he be assigned to duties in the United States that these could sustain the opinion of the hearing officer and the decision of the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.979" offset="11219257">It therefore cannot be said that the decision of the army is without a basis, in fact, they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.415" offset="11249037">And the Court of Appeals affirmed holding on Page 51 of the Appendix, that beyond question there was a basis in fact, for the conclusions of the Department of the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.998" offset="11303372">It further pointed out, that the petitioner objects to the war in Vietnam, not to all wars and clearly his views are completely inconsistent with objection to war in any form.</text>
