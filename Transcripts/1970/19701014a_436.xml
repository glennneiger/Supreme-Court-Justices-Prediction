            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="16.474" offset="65829">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.697" offset="78785">Before commenting my argument, I would like to explain one circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.624" offset="110446">The brief which we have filed covers all three cases, the two Charlotte Cases and this case, and it says, the brief for the United States says amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.246" offset="164885">In the Charlotte Cases, we were amicus curiae, though very active one and both lower courts and here, but in this case, we are a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.670" offset="210651">We have been a party plaintiff since 1967, and we appeared here as a party, and the brief should’ve had to somewhat longer caption amicus curiae in those cases and for the United States as a party in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.604" offset="286407">I should also like to make it plain, though I assume it is entirely plain for what is going on that we do not support the Board here and never have.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.639" offset="338547">We have been with the counsel for the petitioners here fighting against the dilatory tactics of this Board for the past three years and we still are and we do not support the Board in the Charlotte case and never had.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.293" offset="417123">In the District Court in this case, after repeated appearances of the case in the Court of Appeals, which are cited in the memorandum, which we filed in connection with the petition for certiorari, we submitted a plan on January 27, 1970, and this was in fact based on one of the HEW plans but with some modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.630" offset="554423">And it was submitted then as following these Court’s decisions last term requiring immediate action, it was submitted then as one which could be implemented immediately pendente lite to remain in effect until the conclusion of the then current school year that is until June 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.600" offset="662361">The District Court rejected that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.682" offset="678661">On appeal to the Court of Appeals in expedited procedure and without oral argument, the Court of Appeals ordered the Government’s plan into affect on a permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.730" offset="734877">That put us in something of a problem because it was our plan, which the Court of Appeals had to approve although we had not offered it as a permanent plan, we did not file a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.992" offset="799869">But we did file a memorandum with the Court saying that we thought that the decision would be reviewed and because the petitioners were filing a petition, we felt that it was not necessary for us to file a petition, which would have involved our seeming and the sense at least to attest the plan which we had filed with the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.766" offset="911047">Now, the two cases, Charlotte and Mobile present perhaps the extremes of the situations, which may come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.160" offset="964545">In Charlotte, the District Judge applied perhaps his drastic irresolution as possible and we have contented that he may have applied the wrong standard in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.262" offset="1036957">Here in Mobile, number 436, the Court of Appeals has entered what may be regarded as a minimal order under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.980" offset="1087843">It does include specifically ordered by the Court of Appeals a majority to minority transfer plans so that no student is locked into any school where he is in the majority race.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.304" offset="1153149">Does that also include the transportation [Voice Overlap]?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="292.867" stopTime="469.976">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="292.867" offset="1171435">Yes, Mr. Justice, that includes in non-segregated busing and I believe priority that is the right to get into the school and even against the contention that there are no places.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.904" offset="1243533">The order also includes allocation of teachers, so that a great many of the steps, which can be taken to remove the appearance of the school as being a black school or a white school have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.452" offset="1333708">In our view, it promises realistically the work and it promises realistically the work now, but I repeat, on a minimal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.471" offset="1433809">At the argument yesterday, it was suggested by Mr. Nabrit that our position here and our position in the Charlotte busing cases were inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.079" offset="1488248">We did not seek to appear orally in the several cases that we’re argued in the latter part of yesterday, but we did file briefs and we do support the District Court in the Charlotte busing cases, the three-judge District Court, which held in the North Carolina statute unconstitutional numbers 444 and 498.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.432" offset="1613636">But I believe that our positions in these cases are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.488" offset="1633907">Our position here and there is that the Constitution requires disestablishment of dual school systems requires that disestablishment of dual school systems requires affirmative action to disestablish dual school systems, no more, but likewise no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.653" offset="1742576">In the bus case arising the North Carolina statute, numbers 444 and 498, we think that the statute interferes without objective and so was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.556" offset="1802136">Here, we think that the order of the Court of Appeals does show promise of eliminating the dual school system, though barely so and thus we support the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.731" offset="1862844">I think that this point --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="469.976" offset="1879876">Perhaps, I’m mistaken but isn’t there possibly a little question bugging in the statement of your position?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.973" offset="1915820">Isn’t the real issue here, what is required to completely disestablish a dual school system?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.294" offset="1945078">The gentleman on this side of the table say that the very disestablish -- the very disestablishment of a dual school system requires the elimination of all racially identifiable Negro schools unless that is shown to be absolutely impossible.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="504.640" offset="2018534">And you proceed, you say once a dual school system is disestablished, then the neighborhood schools were all right and that’s kind of skipping over the basic issue, isn’t it?</text>
            <text syncTime="516.883" offset="2067435">How is it required to disestablish this dual school system?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="520.178" stopTime="600.916">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="520.178" offset="2080705">Surely, the problems are very complex and highly interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.908" offset="2107559">I think it is possible to post their argument in a form which says that the schools are not disestablished until no black student may be assigned to a racially identifiable black school at any grade level, which is the position for which they contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.991" offset="2203899">Our position is that that is not required, that it is required to not merely to eliminate any discrimination now which is what the North Carolina statute does, if we were starting out a new with a clean slate and we’re writing a picture for what America ought to be, we might well include the North Carolina statute in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.669" offset="2326674">But the statute was interposed at a time when there was a great deal of history and a great many practical consequences and we think that the statute interferes with actions, which must be taken in order to disestablish what had clearly been an existing dual school system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="600.916" stopTime="633.226">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="600.916" offset="2403579">Perhaps I can ask my question this way Mr. Solicitor General, your position as I understand it is that once there has been a disestablishment, dismantling of a dual school system, then a neighborhood school system is constitutionally permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.241" offset="2496888">Now, may I ask what in your view does the Constitution require for that first step to disestablish, to dismantle the dual school system as a [Voice Overlap]?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="633.226" stopTime="716.895">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="633.226" offset="2532833">Well Mr. Justice, let me start with a slightly different example which I want to use in my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.430" offset="2569718">Suppose we had a school system, where there was absolutely no trace of any prior discrimination, no dual school system ever, nothing with respect to public housing or restrictive covenants or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.736" offset="2658847">And we find that in this system, a lot of people of German descent come to this community and a lot of people have Slovak descent had come to this community, and a lot of Negroes are living here although Negroes are living elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.032" offset="2720078">And in that community, we find a school which is all or 90% black, I would say that there is nothing in the Constitution which requires that there’d be any change in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.831" offset="2775249">In other words, if you can find a place where there is no past history of discrimination, I do not believe that anything can be found in the general language of the equal protection laws or the dual process laws which supports the position that no black student may be assigned to a racially identified school at any grade.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="716.895" stopTime="725.111">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="716.895" offset="2867513">Wouldn’t you want to update to make that hypothesis include in a past or present discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="723.057" offset="2892173">You wouldn’t rule out present discrimination.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="725.330" offset="2901264">Yes, I would certainly rule out any present -- I would, if there is any present discrimination or past discrimination, then steps must be taken to eliminating, and how extensive, how drastic those steps are.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.828" offset="2971272">It seems to me depend on two things, (a) on the one hand, the need, the extent to which there has been past discrimination and the effect of that still continues which is very great in Mobile and certainly considerable in Charlotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.955" offset="3039817">And on the other hand, on this problem on which we haven’t been able to find a word and I have no doubt to never will be exactly one word, reasonable, feasible, absolutely unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.623" offset="3106482">I think absolutely unworkable is too strong, I seize upon feasible because I thought it will just considerably stronger word than reasonable, but it ought to be explained with words which indicate that strong action is required to eliminate past discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.913" offset="3243572">I think Mr. Justice, that is clear provided in the null, you subsumed everything that has happened in the past in which has its effect null.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.172" offset="3284637">And there is undoubted, there is obviously enormous amounts of that effect in Mobile and a great deal of it in Charlotte, and to eliminate discrimination now, you have to take steps to eliminate the effects of that past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.778" offset="3343047">In my view, it is not enough to say, well, we’ll leave things just as they are, but from now on, we’ll be good.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.854" offset="3371363">That seems to me not to take the steps which this Court has long indicated beginning in Cooper and Aaron and then Green and Montgomery County must be taken to eliminate the effects of past discrimination which effects are effective null.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.418" offset="3877616">The Court adopted it, and I hadn’t suppose there was any ground to question that actions must be taken now based on race in order to eliminate effects of past discrimination, and we support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.204" offset="3948774">It’s only a question really of how far that has to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.646" offset="3966537">This it seems to us is what the Court ordered onto the Constitution in Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.359" offset="3989420">It’s what the court spelled out in Green and Montgomery County and it is the standard which should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.600" offset="4034351">There is today as always a tendency for legal thinking to be too much dominated by clichés.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.522" offset="4102060">Perhaps this is true about racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.801" offset="4123167">There is likewise I think the possibility of great misunderstanding in the talk about neighborhood schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.683" offset="4158694">For what is worth to the best of my ability, I do not think that you will find the phrase, neighborhood schools in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.278" offset="4193071">You will find neighborhood and you will find schools, and perhaps this is just a quibble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.336" offset="4229329">But that phrase is used by some persons as a subterfuge for maintaining segregation and I’ve seen that in my own area of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.488" offset="4285858">There is no doubt that when applied in bad faith, it can work out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.405" offset="4321593">I have no doubt for example that if were applied in Mobile without any court supervision that it would work out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.265" offset="4357016">And I am not appearing for such a conception of the neighborhood school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.214" offset="4384810">As the President said in his statement of March 24, 1970, “while the dual school system is the most obvious example, the jury segregation has also found in more subtle forms where authorities have deliberately drawn attendant zones or chosen school locations for the expressed purpose of creating and maintaining racially separate schools, the jury segregation has held to exist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.885" offset="4523468">In such cases, the School board has a positive duty to remedy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.708" offset="4546769">This is so even though the Board ostensibly operates a unitary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.511" offset="4574041">And in the same statement, the President said in referring to executive action, “the neighborhood school will be deemed the most appropriate base for such a system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.358" offset="4633391">Note that he said base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.914" offset="4647602">He did not mean that it was the sole method or the sole requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.849" offset="4671321">Many methods are available and our evidence in the record in these cases which will serve to eliminate or minimize the consequences of past official conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.778" offset="4723043">Thus, there can be truly impartial zones, there can be pairing of schools, and this was particularly relevant in the smaller communities which previously had dual systems with two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.739" offset="4794932">That was true in New Kent County, you have a black school and you have a white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.775" offset="4815099">It’s easy to eliminate the dual schools system by saying one school will take grades one to four, the other school will take grades five to eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.924" offset="4855641">And there can be closing of some schools and expanding of others, and there can be satellite pairing when the distances are not too great and when the corridor is not a clear jury mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.379" offset="4933486">And of course, there must be proper allocation of faculty, and there must be elimination of discrimination in busing and in athletics and activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.590" offset="4986358">All of these things can be done and should be done as far as feasible in order to eliminate the consequences of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.224" offset="5040797">School boards are making decisions all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.427" offset="5061695">They will not have done enough if they simply established properly designated neighborhood schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.020" offset="5100042">They are making decisions daily, short range and long range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.052" offset="5132121">They ought to be required when they make decisions to make the choice, which will tend to overcome segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.501" offset="5169946">The decision making process cannot be used to perpetuate segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.901" offset="5199517">What schools are you going to expand?</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.169" offset="5216653">What programs are you going to promote?</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.411" offset="5233580">All of these things must be properly handled and are required in addition to the basic concept of having children, especially small children, go to school within a feasible distance of their own homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.627" offset="5314456">Now turning to another matter, there’s been some reference in these arguments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the provision which Congress included there with respect to busing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.813" offset="5379239">That was in Section 407 (a) of that Act and the Section specifically authorizes the Attorney General to institute for or in the name of the United States say civil action for relief, and then it goes on and says provided that nothing herein, nothing herein is the key word of that provision, shall empower any official or Court of the United States to require busing to achieve racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.743" offset="5514971">Well, this is not a suit by the Attorney General under Section 407 (a), there is no provision in that statute or in any other statute because somewhat similar things have been enacted as riders on HEW Appropriation Act which take away any powers which the courts otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.596" offset="5598354">All that this statute does is to make it plain that that statute does not add to any authorities what the Court might otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.540" offset="5638060">Or let me put it another way, it makes it plain that Congress is not under that statute making an enactment under Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires or specifically authorizes that that kind of busing be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.450" offset="5701799">I think that the statutory acts in both here and in the Appropriation Acts is relevant simply because it indicates that Congress has not sought an extension to require busing to achieve racial balance which in my opinion, though it’s not here and I haven’t fully considered it and it isn’t brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.859" offset="5799393">But in my opinion is now advised, Congress could in exercising its powers under Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.215" offset="5844846">All I think that that statutory language means is that Congress has not exercised such powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.348" offset="8149368">I encountered this first in connection with predominantly black law schools and we have of course the example of Howard University here, which I suppose everyone has the strongest feelings that it should be supported in the United Negro College Fund and other such things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.043" offset="10444069">Now, let’s turn to a moment to another question that was raised and that is the question of the effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.656" offset="10478550">Petitioner relies heavily on the fact that busing to preserve segregation occurred in the past and this is freely admitted in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.824" offset="10527242">They point two examples of busing for example where the students in this area which is in the rural area and I might remind the Court that this is a map of Metropolitan Mobile, Prichard and Chickasaw, three cities with co-terminus boundary lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.652" offset="10594534">This is roughly 18 miles North to South and 13 miles from East to West.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.639" offset="10618462">The county itself is 53 miles from North to South and 27 miles East to West, from the river to the Mississippi line from the Gulf of Mexico North.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.131" offset="10676454">With reference to the bus, students carried from these area black students bused to this area four or five years ago into this school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.087" offset="10724310">Unquestionably this occurred, but these students are no longer bused and have not been bused for four or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.635" offset="10758478">How can it be contended that there’s any effect left from the dual system as a result of busing 30 students from here to here five years ago?</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.031" offset="10812082">Certainly, it was in effect at that time but we’re dealing with a presently existing effect of the once dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.851" offset="10863386">The same thing occurs with reference to split zones of nine contiguous zones as petitioner referred to yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.205" offset="10912810">With reference to the Whistler and Thomas schools indicating the fact that one time Thomas an all-Negro schools questioned an all-white school and people from this area whereas the time there was no school went pass to the Thomas school to the Whistler school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.495" offset="10993894">There again, this occurred four or five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.473" offset="11009881">Where can it be any present existing effect from this as it exist now when you consider that Thomas, which was once the all-Negro school is now 62% white and has been for two school terms predominantly white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.454" offset="11085740">And Whistler, which was at one time all white is now 52% white although last year it was predominantly Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.017" offset="11132029">Petitioner has stated that Mobile has never adhered to the neighborhood school concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.932" offset="11167660">This is incorrect and I must adopt at least in the part of the language of the Solicitor General with reference to the misconception with reference to the clichés or seizing upon words such as the neighborhood skill concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.915" offset="11235579">As the record will show, the Mobile school system has always adhered to and favored the neighborhood school’s concept based upon specific geographic zones except when ordered by the Court to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.898" offset="11315513">Admittedly, prior to the disestablishment of the dual school system, at one time they existed that the dual zones, overlapping zones, one zone for black, one zone for white, superimposed upon one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.817" offset="11387193">This has been disestablished and was disestablished as much as four years ago by the simple elimination of both zones redrawing the zone around each school, a unitary zone so that every person, black or white goes to the school within the zone regardless of the present or past racial makeup of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.425" offset="11489698">Admittedly, prior to the disestablishment of the dual system, there were these overlapping zones but they no longer exist and it should be observed in its adherence to the neighborhood school concept as a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.633" offset="11554482">The Mobile Board opposed freedom of choice when this first concept looked upon as apparently a panacea, which didn’t pan out first came upon the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.562" offset="11610175">Admittedly, several years after the freedom of choice concept, which was foreign to the Mobile school system came upon the public saying that Board’s republic pressure was forced into asking the Court for freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.876" offset="11679451">But we have never had freedom of choice in the Mobile public school system except when it was specifically requested by motion of the Justice Department for a freedom of choice in the rural portion of the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="4724.202" offset="18896771">I present argument on behalf of the respondents Mobile County Council’s PTA which is an association of the PTA associations of the various schools in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.005" offset="18959987">PTA getting to this chase as an intervenor, I think Mr. Philips’ statement in the record in this case will indicate the problem that the PTA or the members, the parents, the teachers and the students were faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.317" offset="19029264">The number of changes that we have seen in the last few months is absolutely devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.636" offset="19058521">I don’t think anyone of us in this courtroom could live with the changes that these people have had to face and each one was highly publicized in the newspaper because that was part of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.237" offset="19100944">When the District Court made a change, it was publicized and each of the parents get rid of, now my child is going to school, he have had one over here, one over there and one over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.513" offset="19133962">Next month, next week sometimes, there would be revision either by the District Court or by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.682" offset="19166668">So we intervene in the case on a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.387" offset="19181505">I think basically we were concerned with the fact that the people in Mobile wanted the neighborhood concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="4810.479" offset="19241900">And by neighborhood schools, we’re talking about community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.089" offset="19252349">Mobile as you might -- Mr. Philips may have pointed out and I would like to reiterate a couple of, just a couple of points that the concentration of the colored or black population plus, if you might, if you will right in this area, right through here with a few engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.038" offset="19320059">This is a densely populated black area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.419" offset="19333642">Mobile is a red light city or the metropolitan areas were the large, 155 square miles in the city itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.497" offset="19369900">But all the concentration on those things makes it more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.342" offset="19381290">It is the fact that on this side, if you like to see all this water, this is none but marsh land and river water, one town going on the river to Mobile County and I want this at one bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.497" offset="19421936">I mean this is just a demarcation physical impossibility and nestled against the bank of all this water is a black community, see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.623" offset="19458403">And all the rest of the county and the city is located to the west and to the north and to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.834" offset="19487242">So the difficult problem is not even like the Charlotte case which had the community and nestled in the middle where you could go out in two directions, four directions at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.790" offset="19535099">In addition to that, since we’re on a junior high level, you can see why Washington and I don’t know whether you Justices can see as well but getting up a little higher, this zone right here is the Washington zone which Mr. Philips, Jr. and Mr. Greenberg have both discussed, the fact that people didn’t even attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.021" offset="19608033">What you will see, the school is sitting way up here on a predominantly colored neighborhood then you will notice right here, this large population of students here that previously went to one of these other schools, either right here across to a few blocks so here are few block now travel as much as 12 in outmost to get there in possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="4979.939" offset="19919726">When I say that simply this, Mr. Justice Marshall, is that every parent feels an obligation to participate in the educational institution to which his child attends and this is an obligation that you feel in Mobile I guess as much as any other community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.157" offset="19984614">That they feel an obligation to participate as a community in every school and no matter which school it is, whether it’s biracial or whether it’s uniracial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.590" offset="20022335">They participate in the activities and the tragedy of the whole thing is as if Mr. Russell pointed out, is that these people, some of them, we are losing out of the schools, Mobile is losing to private schools and otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.392" offset="20101538">Some of the people who are leaders, their parents would otherwise be leaders and instruments in causing these schools to become a part of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.441" offset="20133721">Even an underprivileged child under the structure of the PTA council, any given school receive many benefits from the council itself or from the PTA itself because of the fact that making people more interested are more instrumental in the school and a parent who has to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.986" offset="20207909">Now, look at the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.320" offset="20229224">If we attack the issue squarely before the Court as I see it in this case is not the issue of whether or not a child is bused 1 mile or 2 miles or 4 miles or 20 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.524" offset="20282096">The issue is a fundamental constitutional right of the individual to be compelled to attend any particular school so we own the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.318" offset="20321176">We need no nothing else but one thing to make the sign what’s on the plans sought by the petition, that is save the race of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.936" offset="20355657">If you know the race of the child, we can assign but without we cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.432" offset="20373629">And this is, this is being made this whole basis of this whole plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.169" offset="20392647">The school board, the Courts and they have time for this problem for seven years and it’s a physical impossibility to convene, put children in schools under the plan proposed by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.300" offset="20453146">And I say that and this, there is no act with public transportation in Mobile, the transportation company went broke and collapsed and the city picked up the transportation system in its hands and now running with extreme deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.530" offset="20518034">There is no adequate busing facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.926" offset="20531618">The busing is a minimal amount of busing done in the semi-suburban area simply because people live so far from the schools and they’re built because the schools don’t accommodate them, and the county of this busing has an old rural county.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.669" offset="20582609">But at the same time, we held a problem here of the people in the system getting their children to school under this plan because every child, every child would have to be bused in every grade, almost under system and they just don’t have adequate buses, we are dealing with a $2 million, $3 million budget which Mobile does not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="5248.354" offset="20993358">There has indeed been a great deal of confusion in Mobile and that confusion has stemmed in considerable part from the fact that Judge Thomas has not given hearings in any of these plans for a period of two years and as an example, I would like to point to the question of the missing students.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.329" offset="21069218">One reason why there are some missing students is there has been a loss of population of approximately 17,000 over the past few years in Mobile because of the closing of the Brookley Air Force base but another reason is that there is something down there known as non-conformers, children going to school as they please, where they please in violation of the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.340" offset="21145287">Mr. Cooper and I went in to see Judge Thomas about two weeks ago to get a hearing on the non-conformers and he said he would set it for some time in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.223" offset="21176842">We pointed out that we thought there was some urgency to setting it and setting it soon because school was going on now and he said he would set it in November and if we disagreed, we could go to the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="5438.569" offset="21754253">We just put right in by Judge Thomas without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.764" offset="21767001">At an earlier stage, we made a motion to the Court that this thing hadn’t occurred several times, saying that we would like a procedure set down for filing objections and papers and having a hearing and it was denied and that’s all set forth in our brief and it’s in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.834" offset="21847249">May it please the Court, despite the considerable disagreement over the matters discussed in the last moment or two; there has been nevertheless a remarkable amount of agreement among the parties and the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.356" offset="21909420">With the exception of the more plaintiffs who feel that nothing at all ought to be done and the respondents in this case who have not addressed themselves to the question of what ought to be done, everyone or perhaps everyone appears to agree that race can and must be taken into account to undo the effects of the jury segregated school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.674" offset="22002625">The Fifth Circuit has moved lines and it has gerrymandered, the Fourth Circuit has done that and indeed in the Swann case itself has approved busing and noncontiguous zoning for Junior High School and High School students.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.271" offset="22052989">The Solicitor General advocates gerrymandering when it feels it’s appropriate, building schools, closing schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.021" offset="22080052">Charlotte School Board believes it can gerrymander in the face of the advice of its counsel but its counsel thinks it can locate schools but not move school zone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.529" offset="22122057">The Athens Board believes it can do what it calls pocket busing which is what we call noncontiguous zoning or clustering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.712" offset="22154762">Judge McMillan believes that relief should be effective and he should use a variety of techniques to achieve a result of no identifiable Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.548" offset="22202096">We urge in the Mobile case that the judgment below be reversed, that the case be sent back in accordance with the principles of Alexander against Holmes County for hearings and a timetable I suggest to pay Alexander but a plan, not alternate of B1 devised by HEW but a plan of that general nature, using the techniques that have been available in Mobile be employed and that the test be one of results not anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.319" offset="22333231">Now, I would say in further response to the Chief Justice’s question of yesterday which was essentially when can the Federal Courts get out of this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.640" offset="22374504">That is the Federal Courts will get out of this business as soon as the results are achieved with an identifiable clear test is decided upon and people know what they have to do where in Mobile, as an extreme example, they haven’t had the slightest (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="5697.607" offset="22790374">I think Judge McMillan handled it quite pragmatically, he had a 4% school and he had a 40% school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.319" offset="22817228">He did not insist upon a rigid ratio, we don’t but just as in the jury cases which have been spoken about which I think are really not appropriate in many respects, the universe is larger, you’re not dealing with 12 people, you’re dealing with 900 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.126" offset="22876473">You do look at the numbers to get some idea of whether or not there’s been to wide a deviation.</text>
