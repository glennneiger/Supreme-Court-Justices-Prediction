            <label>Mr. John F. Dienelt</label>
            <text syncTime="41.260" offset="268413">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.920" offset="283042">This case is here on direct appeal from the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.554" offset="305612">The District Court dismissed the five-count information alleging violations of Section 834 of Title 18 which deals with the transportation of explosives and other dangerous substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.021" offset="363499">Section 834 which we have set forth in part on page 3 of our brief provides that “whoever knowingly violates regulations formulated for the safe transportation of hazardous materials shall be fined up to $1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than a year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="84.934" offset="443120">The information in this case charge the appellee which is a corporation engaged primarily in the manufacturing and shipping of chemicals and fertilizers with violations of a regulation, which we’ve also set forth on page 3, dealing with the contents of shipping papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.217" offset="516263">The regulation requires that the shipper state on a shipping paper designated names and classifications of substances which he is shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.281" offset="556492">In this case, for example the shipper was shipping sulfuric acid and the regulations required him to state sulfuric acid on the shipping paper which is the name and corrosive liquid, which is the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.959" offset="615215">And this safety requirement serves essentially two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.480" offset="633292">First, it indicates to the carrier what kind of labels he should put on the packages and what kind of placards he should put on his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.608" offset="669759">And secondly, the shipping paper itself which is kept in cab of the truck with the driver enables the driver or anybody else who might be involved in an emergency such as an accident or a fire to quickly identify what the substance is and to take whatever appropriate steps such clearing an area might be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.586" offset="753768">The five counts in this information each alleged similar conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.454" offset="773204">Three of them alleged a knowing failure to state the required classification and as corrosive liquid on the shipping papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.554" offset="805595">And two, alleged knowing failure to state both the required classification and the required name of the substance being shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.153" offset="848018">The District Court granted the appellee’s motion to dismiss this information on the ground that it did not state an essential element of the offense and that essential element in the Court’s language was knowledge of violating the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.142" offset="923982">As we read that ruling, the District Court held that the Government has to allege and prove not only that the appellee knew it was shipping a dangerous article without stating its proper name and classification on the shipping papers, which we alleged in the information but also that it knew the terms of the regulation forbidding that conduct and specifically intended to violate that regulation or as the District Court put it, an added ingredient of consciousness that it’s illegal not to do the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.471" offset="1137246">Well, I thought --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_f_dienelt" startTime="259.007" stopTime="879.931">
            <label>Mr. John F. Dienelt</label>
            <text syncTime="259.007" offset="1139440">I gather it was, I didn’t know.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.735" offset="1154278">The question in the case then is the simple one and it’s whether a defendant can be convicted under this statute for intentionally engaging in conduct that is prohibited even though he doesn’t know that the law prohibits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.400" offset="1213001">We believe that a shipper or carrier can be convicted under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.070" offset="1235675">Our position is simply that proof of knowledge of pertinent the facts is what is essential and proof of knowledge of law is not that the defendant is presumed to know the regulations governing transportation of dangerous articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.730" offset="1298265">Now, he's charge with that knowledge under the fundamental principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse its violations by one who intentionally engages in conduct which the law forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.393" offset="1356988">Charging shippers and carriers of dangerous substances with knowledge of regulations regarding their transport seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.117" offset="1407875">In the first place, the substances are dangerous and that alone ought to signal, the possibility of existence of a regulatory scheme regarding the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.746" offset="1450402">So this case in that sense is similar to United States against Freed which this Court decided this month.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.667" offset="1478092">And in that case, the Court ruled that specific intent for knowledge that gun were unregistered was an essential element of the crime of possession of an unregistered firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.760" offset="1522395">In effect, that the rule that the individual could be presumed to know or charged with knowledge of the registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.636" offset="1561893">In this case and in numerous regulatory areas, there's another factor which makes it particularly appropriate to charge the people engaged in forbidden conduct with knowledge of the regulations and that is that this appellee and most of the people who are brought under a prosecution under this statute are in the business of shipping dangerous substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.775" offset="1666487">So, our fundamental position is that there is no basis in this case for making an exception to the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.097" offset="1715806">We’d like to emphasize three points in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.746" offset="1734405">I would like to discuss the language of the statute, the effect of this Court’s decision in Boyce Motor Lines against the United States, some 20 years ago in 342 U.S., and the history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.235" offset="1800338">The first point deals with the language, the statute says, “knowingly violates regulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="432.281" offset="1832521">This is a typical regulatory pattern in numerous areas where Congress simply can’t fill out the details of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.740" offset="1870346">It sets forth the general prohibition and leaves to the administrative agency the responsibility for filling in the details and designating the specific conduct that’s forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.972" offset="1919248">And this language “knowingly violates regulations” is standard terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.361" offset="1944848">It’s used in numerous statutes we've cited, some of them in Footnote 7 of our brief at page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.751" offset="1986330">We submit that if Congress in these various regulatory areas had set forth the prohibited conduct in the statute itself, there wouldn’t be any question but that the Government’s only obligation would be to prove knowledge of the facts and not knowledge of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.331" offset="2056652">For example, in this case, the Congress had written a statute that says, “Whoever knowingly ships sulfuric acid without stating on the shipping papers that it is sulfuric acid and that it is a corrosive liquid shall be punished.”</text>
            <text syncTime="506.106" offset="2127809">We submit in that situation there wouldn’t be any question that our burden of proof would be what we've alleged in the information here, knowing conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.063" offset="2167620">Similarly, if Congress had written as is it would have had to in a regulatory statute or as it likely would and as it has in cases where it has set forth conduct that is prohibited in the statute itself, set forth a number of different kinds of conduct and then had one provision that says, “whoever knowingly violates the statute or the statutory provisions shall be punished.”</text>
            <text syncTime="542.363" offset="2272841">We submit the same result would obtain that we would have to prove knowledge of the facts and not knowledge of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.211" offset="2308263">We don’t think the results shall be any different because Congress has adopted a convenient shorthand in this case as a means of delegating responsibility to the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.329" offset="2352671">In this case, the Department of Transportation and for incorporating all the various prohibitions that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.845" offset="2386735">We realize it’s possible to read the language “knowingly violate regulations” to suggest that you have to know what the regulation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.239" offset="2424351">But we think that the position which evidently is the appellee’s position and which was the position stated in a concurring opinion by Judge Magruder in the St. Johnsbury Trucking case which was a leading early Court of Appeals decision on this matter, that the use of that language justifies a distinction</text>
            <text syncTime="599.405" offset="2500942">.We don’t believe that that’s a proper reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.180" offset="2520064">It places too much emphasis in the abstract or the semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.210" offset="2536260">It ignores the practical reality which we feel make it perfectly clear that the use of the phrase “knowingly violates regulations” in this case is simply a shorthand.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.793" offset="2586520">In fact, there are some cases in which Congress has on a rare occasion indicated that an ignorance of a regulation or a lack of knowledge of a regulation will be an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.792" offset="2634585">It will be an affirmative defense and it stated that quite plainly in the statute in language quite different from the language here which decided two similar cases in footnote 11 of our brief on page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.648" offset="2698010">Now, turning specifically to the judicial and legislative consideration of the statute, our second point is that this Court’s decision in the Boyce case should involve the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.385" offset="2752867">It does not require the Government to prove knowledge of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.360" offset="2768854">The Boyce decision didn’t hold that, it really didn’t reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.963" offset="2783274">It didn’t specifically address itself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.021" offset="2795499">The Court there assumed as did the parties that the shipper, it was a carrier on that case, knew the regulations and proceeded to examine factual circumstances not the question of knowledge of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.770" offset="2866448">The issue in Boyce was whether a regulation was vague and the regulation involved dealt with the routing of trucks through congested areas and it required that the trucks be routed this so far as practicable, that was the key language in that case as far as the vagueness is concerned, as far as practicable to avoid congested areas such as towns and the defendant in that case had routed its trucks to the Holland Town in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.558" offset="2985566">The District Court dismissed the case with rather three counts of an indictment there, on ground that it was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.315" offset="3016600">The Court of Appeals reversed and this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.176" offset="3028093">And in affirming the decision, this Court indicated that the fact that the defendant was required “knowingly” to violate the regulations was crucial and it stated what it meant by that requirement, in a passage that we’ve set forth on page 10 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.762" offset="3114402">It said the Government must prove not only that there was in fact a preferable route but also that the defendant knew of such route and nevertheless took a more dangerous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.126" offset="3155884">Or alternatively that the defendant willfully neglected to inquire whether there was such a route.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.025" offset="3183470">The comparable requirement to that proof in this case, we submit is that not only did the defendant shipped a dangerous commodity without stating its nature on the shipping papers but also that it knew what he was doing or alternatively that he willfully neglected to ascertain what the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.743" offset="3274376">There was nothing in Boyce and we submit there's nothing here to suggest that knowledge of the law was also an element of the Government’s proof and regulation in Boyce was more complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.063" offset="3323591">As a result of that, the defendant as the Court suggested in Boyce might very well, by showing a good faith compliance with the regulations, by showing that he chose a route and he tried to choose the safest route that that might provide a defense and that that the jury in that case might equip on such a basis. But still the point was that it was factual circumstances that the regulation made pertinent and not the knowledge of the regulation itself that was critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.672" offset="3458069">And we don’t suggest here that a showing by the defendant at a trial that he didn’t know what he was shipping or that he made some other inadvertent conduct would not be a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.435" offset="3529122">This was dismissal of an information.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.808" offset="3538631">We don’t have a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.720" offset="3542288">We don’t know what the defense of the appellee would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.150" offset="3555976">We submit that there are genuine issues which in some cases may arise and that those should properly be determined at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.035" offset="3595473">Finally, we’d like briefly to turn to the legislative history of this section.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.729" offset="3814275">These cases usually are based on largely on documentary evidence, so you’d have the shipping paper and you, be able to see what he put on the shipping paper and you’ll be able to see what he put on the shipping paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.700" offset="3850219">And he’d have a very strong case if he had olive oil written on the shipping paper that’s what he thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.203" offset="3872162">It would be a hard case for us to prove, we might very well not indict in such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.360" offset="3900792">I was advised that very recently there was a case where the Government decided not to prosecute and which an employee had gotten the wrong number on the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.280" offset="3948544">He’d hitched his cab up to 1191 instead of 1157 something like that the Government decided that it wouldn’t be indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.656" offset="3981981">Situations like that might very well provide offenses of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.133" offset="3999953">But we don’t believe that that has anything to bear on the nature of the elements that the Government must allege in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.748" offset="4038405">There isn’t any legislative history of the very early provisions stating back to around 1908 regarding what Congress meant by using “knowingly” in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.627" offset="4641834">We believe the most consistent reading of that case, the best reading of that case is that it assumed and it presumed that the shipper would have that knowledge and that lack of that knowledge would not be a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.371" offset="4844857">It involved the shipping paper requirement which at that time required the shipper to attach or designate a label which would be then put on the dangerous commodity on the shipping paper and the proof at trial according to the Court of Appeals’ opinion was that the rating clerk who is the only person in the operation responsible for this either negligently failed to do it or else clipped it on with a paper clip and the paper clip fell off and the papers got separated as a result of that, the shipping papers didn’t show the classification and the truck wasn’t properly placarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.220" offset="4996263">The Court discussed the Boyce opinion and it made some general references with respect to the knowledge of the law but the critical holding in which it sort of paraphrased Boyce was that the Government must prove that the defendant, I'm quoting from the case now, “aware of the dangerous nature of the commodity deliberately chose to transport it without placarding its trucks or labeling it shipping papers or that the defendant willfully neglected to take proper precautions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.286" offset="5120502">Now, that’s what we feel we've alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.449" offset="5133145">That’s what we believe we can prove at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.152" offset="5147982">Our point about the legislative history of the revision of the 1960 Act as we stated essentially in our reply brief is basically that it’s neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.807" offset="5682552">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.332" offset="5696658">The sole issue in this case is the sufficiency of the information to state an offense against the United States under Section 834 (f) of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.194" offset="5740126">Our position with respect to that issue can be very briefly stated in three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.948" offset="5763114">First, the involved statute punishes only one who knowingly violates the regulation; Second, to state an offense under the statute, the defendant must be charged with knowingly violating the regulations; and third, the information here does not charge the defendant with knowingly violating the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.005" offset="5847437">Therefore, the Court properly dismissed the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.029" offset="5863528">That was the sole reasoning of the Court and I submit that its reasoning was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.107" offset="5883800">The Court didn’t go any further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.222" offset="5892263">There's been no trial, no evidence submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.281" offset="5904488">The Court simply dismissed the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.208" offset="5916191">The first proposition as I submit self evident from the wording of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.989" offset="5935313">The statute does not punish an unknowing violation whether or not the defendant intended to do the act that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.632" offset="5965928">It only punishes a knowing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.407" offset="5980975">The second proposition naturally follows from the first one and I don’t believe there can be any argument about that under the well-known rule that the information must charge all the essential elements of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.127" offset="6027891">It must charge the defendant with the knowing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.902" offset="6042937">So, we come to the crucial question which is, “Did the information charge the defendant with a knowing violation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.989" offset="6075329">Well, it didn’t do so in expressed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.092" offset="6087764">The charge is a knowing act which happens to be in violation of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.032" offset="6107512">But that is not the offense which is punishable by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.645" offset="8201906">And in Chief Judge Magruder’s concurring opinion in that case, he took up this very point and he explained the difference between an act knowingly done and which happened to be in violation of the regulation and a knowing violation of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.554" offset="8261569">And he made that very clear and he says, “It depends upon how the offense is defined by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.689" offset="8286124">He says, “That this makes the hard for the Government to prosecute the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.411" offset="8301066">It’s up to Congress to fix it because they can define the offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.803" offset="8318621">Now, I think if those cases are not the answer to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.475" offset="8333249">The legislative history for the 1960 amendments is conclusive because the commission which at that time had jurisdiction over these regulations, they’ve since been transferred to the Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.534" offset="8381524">But at that time, the Interstate Commerce Commission had jurisdiction and they took Judge Magruder’s suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.601" offset="8405765">And they requested in the 85th Congress, they requested the passage of a bill making various amendments to this Act and among that was an amendment to delete the word “knowingly” from what was then Section 835.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.456" offset="8465220">It’s the same Section which is now 834.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.670" offset="8486013">The Senate and the 85th Congress noted that the deletion of the word “knowingly” would create an absolute liability for violation of the Section and the Senate said, “We don’t want to go that far.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.306" offset="8540557">So, they substituted the language reading as follows, “Any person who being aware that the Interstate Commerce Commission has formulated regulations for the safe transportation of explosives and other dangerous articles, now I'm paraphrasing, would be guilty of an offense if there was a noncompliance with the regulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.126" offset="8623835">That bill passed the Senate, I believe, but failed to pass the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.233" offset="8644315">In the 86th Congress, the Commission resubmitted the draft bill and in this case they took the Senate’s language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.113" offset="8679842">They submitted the statement of justification in favor of the proposed amendment, a portion of which we have printed in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.084" offset="8711711">That position -- the position of the Commission was that the word, “knowingly” should be simply deleted from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.452" offset="8745148">But in view of the amendments which a Senate language had made in the 85th Congress, the Commission now took the Senate language and said, “This is preferable to what we have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.708" offset="8786213">Now, in the statement of justification, the principle reason that they used was the fact that the decisions in the Boyce Motor Lines and the St. Johnsbury cases had made prosecutions under the statute very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.228" offset="8844309">That’s set forth in the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.310" offset="8856639">The Senate passed the bill and it went to the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.432" offset="8873148">The House Committee on the judiciary considered it and a portion of its report is printed on page 10 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.961" offset="8903241">The House Committee on the judiciary noted that the Senate's language created an almost absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.075" offset="8939708">The House Committee said, “There are judicial pronouncements as to what constitutes a knowing violation under the present Act and that could not possibly have been anything, except a reference to the Boyce and the St. Johnsbury cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.680" offset="9006059">The House Committee also said, that under the Senate language, little more than proof that the violation had occurred would be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.795" offset="9042526">The House said, “In view of the various substantial penalties which are provided under the statute, it is our considered judgment that such a substantial departure from the existing law is not warranted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.017" offset="9095398">They said, “It is our purpose to retain the present law by providing that a person must knowingly violate the regulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.668" offset="9130088">Now, the Government says in oral argument and in its brief, “that Congress only wanted to preserve traditional scienter requirements of the word “knowingly”, that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.866" offset="9174810">Both the Senate and the House Committees in their reports which are referred to in our brief specifically referred to the fact that under Section 835, the defendant must have knowledge of violating the regulation under that Section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.724" offset="9242311">Now, it is clear that the Senate did not want the absolute liability of the Interstate Commerce Commission version.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.316" offset="9604681">Under the Senate version, he could not be prosecuted because he who had no knowledge of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.722" offset="9630281">But under this version that the Government now supposes, he could be prosecuted because that would be all that would be required and I think the same thing is true of the Chief Justice’s illustration on the olive oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.804" offset="9690572">I think if you look at the wording of the information that if that there was a mistake, if they actually shipped sulfuric acid, and that they knowingly failed to show on the shipping papers that it was sulfuric acid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.833" offset="10434748">But there is one thing that goes through all of these cases and that is that the intent of Congress must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.568" offset="10473618">Now, Congress has wide latitude in defining this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.463" offset="10493262">As I have pointed out previously, they defined the offense differently in Section 834 and the way they defined it in 832 and 833, and I submit that the intent of Congress must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.132" offset="10547911">It’s very clear that Congress did not intend to subject to these heavy penalties of a $1,000.00 for each offense and a year in the federal penitentiary for an inadvertent violation of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.594" offset="10609768">I submit, if the Court please, that the District Court was quite correct in its reasoning, that the information here does not charge an offense under Section 834 and that if the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.589" offset="10705690">I only have about two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.596" offset="10717706">First with respect to this language, the point is that it’s a standard terminology which is used in numerous statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.286" offset="10748531">We've cited the statutes at footnote 7 of our brief which deal with the Federal Power Commission and Federal Communications Commission, the Secretary of the Interior, his jurisdiction over conservation and there are numerous other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.671" offset="10822092">And although we are willing to agree that there maybe a certain ambiguity by use of the phrase “knowingly violates regulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.310" offset="10860648">If you read it in the abstract, the fact that it’s used so frequently means to us, that it is merely a means by which Congress has adopted a shorthand to incorporate regulations that are validly promulgated by an administrative agency with respect to Sections 822 and 823 of this Act, that those are situations in which Congress was able or apparently felt itself able to put in part of the conduct in the statute itself rather than delegating full responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.868" offset="11030862">Well, that was the second point, Your Honor. Our position is that it just isn’t clear enough as to what Congress meant when it revised the statute that we can’t get enough guidance with respect to what the Congress intended to impute to them and intent to override what we consider to be a fundamental proposition that that ignorance of the law doesn’t excuse its violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.083" offset="11139741">The Interstate Commerce Commission’s justification which Mr. Spencer referred to, which is quoted in the appendix to his brief, referred to the Commission’s view that reference to culpable intent had been relied upon by defense attorneys and to some extent by Courts as requiring establishment of some minimal element or affirmative intention to evade the law in addition to the knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.489" offset="11265337">This we think emphasizes that even the Interstate Commerce Commission wasn’t absolutely clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.772" offset="11294490">It felt that there was difficulty and it wanted to create absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.632" offset="11309850">I submit that the absolute liability would have been much more helpful to it in terms of eliminating knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.087" offset="11339734">In other words, eliminating the requirement that the defendant had to know he was shipping sulfuric acid for example, and we think that by the same token, it’s possible to read the language that the Senate substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.300" offset="11396577">Whoever is being aware that regulations had been formulated as referring somewhat ironically perhaps to knowledge of the law but not knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.381" offset="11432939">In other words, you’d have a situation where the Government would at trial have to prove a general awareness by the shipper or carrier of knowledge of the regulations but no knowledge at all, absolute liability with respect to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.387" offset="11504933">And that brings me to the third point and that is we don’t intend to say here that there isn’t a defense of a mistake of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.160" offset="11556028">I think that’s for the jury, however, proof necessarily in these cases depends to a large extent on inferring from conduct, knowledge of a failure to comply with regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.962" offset="11611199">For example in this case, we've alleged five counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.515" offset="11629484">We would proffer a trial, 33 other counts and we would ask the jury to infer from that knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.433" offset="11661145">And in that sense, an intent, a culpable intent if you will, to violate the regulations and no further questions.</text>
