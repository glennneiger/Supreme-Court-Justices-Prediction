            <label>Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe</label>
            <text syncTime="45.257" offset="284400">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.787" offset="286490">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.725" offset="298297">This appeal concerns a Cincinnati ordinance which is called the loitering ordinance, but which is really more an unlawful assembly type piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.383" offset="332884">The ordinance provides that when in the company of two or more other people, one so conducts himself as to annoy persons passing by, a crime is committed, unless that conduct takes place at the public meeting of citizens, in which case, it is not crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.065" offset="391607">Hamilton County, Ohio includes Cincinnati and the number of other municipalities and several of them have also had ordinances using similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.625" offset="425880">In the 1940, the common police court for Hamilton County which has county wide jurisdiction held that the language used made the legislation unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.331" offset="464645">All over Ohio, the courts reached the same conclusion through the years and in 1968, the appeals court for the Cleveland area wrote in detail at length and with emphasis how the lack of ascertainable standards made the annoyance test in the Cleveland ordinance cause it to represent an unconstitutional exercise of the police power, and it was therefore void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.880" offset="562866">That opinion is quoted at length at pages 5 and 6 in our jurisdictional statement and was written by the same judge who in 1970, he wrote so strongly to the opposite effect in a 4 to 3 decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in this case of Coates versus Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.914" offset="627022">But at least between 1940 and 1968, the annoyance test was considered to be void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.093" offset="651786">Indeed in 1962, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a dog barking ordinance which used the annoyance test was void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.868" offset="686895">But in 1967 during the summer, Cincinnati along with many other areas had racial disturbances, and the police and perhaps more significantly, other city officials frequently found themselves irritated or provoked, annoyed by the conduct of those who complained and those who disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.262" offset="764426">And members of the city Government including police were not able to charge many of those who irritated them with trespass or assault and battery or profanity or disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.864" offset="810820">So the officials and the police who were beset by annoyance which Webster’s collegiate dictionary in the 7th Edition defines as a wearing on the nerves by persistent petty unpleasantness, they arrested those who provoke them and hold them away and that ended the annoyance for a very short time, because that use of that legislative language making annoyance a crime, directly results in contempt for our system of law and order, or I think more properly law and order with the justice.</text>
