            <label>Mr. Harold B. Wahl</label>
            <text syncTime="33.488" offset="237275">Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.291" offset="252531">This is a right interesting libel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.183" offset="264129">The trial judge actually directed a verdict for the plaintiff on compensatory damages and told the jury that the only question was how many dollars they were going to give the plaintiff on compensatory damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="52.527" offset="313448">As to punitive damages, he told the jury that they can only give those if malice were proven and the jury brought in no punitive acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.263" offset="352423">The attorney for the plaintiff was successful in urging upon the court and the Florida courts have consistently held, in this case, that the New York Times doctrine and I quote from the opinion of the District Court of Appeal on review, only applies “to official conduct of a public official.”</text>
            <text syncTime="85.532" offset="445524">The time of this case was April 1966 at the height of the civil rights controversy in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.274" offset="476453">The locale was rural Citrus County, population 9,268 without even a daily or weekly news or semi-weekly newspaper of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.924" offset="519084">Plaintiff Damron was a small town politician and garage man.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.202" offset="536221">He was Mayor of the Municipality of Crystal River, population 1,523 and a candidate to succeed himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.142" offset="567986">He was also practically a full-time candidate for county tax assessor, politicking for that job while his brother James Damron ran his garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.145" offset="607901">In the middle of the election campaign for county tax assessor, and of course, he was continuously running for re-election as mayor and was subsequently defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.781" offset="642487">The defendant Ocala Star-Banner, the daily newspaper in a nearby Marion County, ran the offending article.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.187" offset="672162">In the article, it was stated, erroneously, that Leonard Damron rather than his brother had had a case continued which was an indictment for perjury in the federal court in the civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.538" offset="729527">Now, if there was anything that was of more public interest in the rural South in April 1966 than civil rights, it was an indictment for perjury of a Damron in a civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.382" offset="796923">Now, the article was written by a man named Myer, who just recently come to this position with the Ocala paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.875" offset="822836">He had never even met the plaintiff, but he had written a number of articles about the political goings on in Crystal River where there two factions and the plaintiff was the head of one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.345" offset="872782">And when the story was phoned in to him, the reporter phoned in the correct name of James Damron, but the area editor had heard so much about and had written so much about this politician brother that throw an error, he just automatically wrote down the wrong name and that's how the name of Leonard got in rather than James.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.489" offset="985318">Leonard then brought a suit for libel and he specifically alleged and I quote from his complaint “that he was a public officer being elected to the office of mayor of Crystal River and a candidate for the office of tax assessor of Citrus County.”</text>
            <text syncTime="237.354" offset="1052818">Then, he charged that the words of the article imputed perjury and again I quote his exact words “to the electorate of Crystal River and Citrus County.”</text>
            <text syncTime="248.385" offset="1096913">He then went on to allege that the article was published in the middle of the election campaign and cost him the election and he concluded by claiming damages to his reputation as a “public officer and candidate for public office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="265.458" offset="1165249">He didn't even alleged malice in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.763" offset="1178415">The word malice doesn't appear in it, even though the Court did submit the issue of malice on punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.011" offset="1203388">What's the significance of your position there?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.602" offset="1217808">In Florida pleading must they allege --</text>

            <text syncTime="282.686" offset="1234108">Malice in a libel suit, yes sir, certainly, under New York Times, you'd have to allege malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.450" offset="1265142">The newspaper moved to dismiss the complaint because of the failure to allege malice and moved to strike the public figure damages where he was claiming damages to him as mayor and as candidate for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.508" offset="1309445">Both motions were denied. The case came on for trial and the Court, as I say, actually instructed the jury to bring in a verdict on community -- on compensatory damages, the only question being the amount of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.358" offset="1360854">Plaintiff testified that he had been defeated for county tax assessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.033" offset="1375483">He gave the salary of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.894" offset="1386977">He further testified that he was defeated for re-election as mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.886" offset="1402964">His trail witnesses repeatedly testified as to the effect that this article had had on his standing with the electorate and that that was what it cost him the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.589" offset="1449775">Motion for new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.824" offset="1466702">It expressly urged the New York Times cases, the motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.304" offset="1484570">The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed on the judgment on the directed verdict, holding that the New York Times doctrine only applied to “official conduct of a public official” and that this alleged libel wasn't a libel that he had done as a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.984" offset="1559280">The Florida Supreme Court refused to review the case and this Court has granted certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.224" offset="1800234">Yes, I don't think there's -- that was his whole theory and if you erroneously accuse a man of being indicted for perjury under civil rights case, under rule of Florida in 1966, well he's goner, short of being elected to public office, there isn't any question about that.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="441.052" offset="1867630">Was there any evidence of injury to him in addition to or except for this public office?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold B. Wahl</label>
            <text syncTime="447.842" offset="1894693">Oh, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.650" offset="1897932">He intermingled the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.121" offset="1903888">He said that he had lost business in this garage shop that his brother, the one that was indicted was running for him and then of course, he said, he felt bad and it made him feel bad with his neighbors and so forth, had been accused of this thing and that sort of thing, he brought that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.207" offset="1964178">But the real thrust of this case was that I have been defeated for county tax assessor and I lost my job as Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.596" offset="2001795">Now, clearly New York Times applies to a situation of this kind where the plaintiff made his own bet.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.180" offset="2036067">I didn't try the case, but the lawyer who tried the case didn't come in and say that he was a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.969" offset="2063235">The plaintiff brought his suit and specifically alleged that he was a public figure that he was the Mayor running for re-election, that it one stand, that he was the candidate for tax assessor, and that he's been damaged as a candidate and as Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.352" offset="2132825">Now, we say under those circumstances that this case should not be sent back for another trial to have more expense, but that this Court should direct a verdict for the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.520" offset="2177442">Now, he had ample opportunity in this case to prove this malice because he was seeking a half million dollars in punitive damages in his complaint and he brought in everything he could on malice to sustain his punitive damages, so has had a chance to prove his malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.197" offset="2240136">The only thing that he showed on malice were three innocuous articles, written not by the man who wrote this story, but by somebody else in the past about him, one of which said, that he had walked out of council meetings and he said, well, I had differences to the council, but I had never physically walked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.234" offset="2320280">Another one said, he had clashes with the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.847" offset="2334804">He said, well, I had differences with them, but I didn't have any clashes and the other one he says gave an erroneous salary for the city attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.776" offset="2366464">Now, certainly those articles were not sufficient to establish malice and that's all he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.911" offset="2394990">As I say, the man who wrote the article made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.206" offset="2408155">There isn't any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.374" offset="2412857">The reporter phoned it in and she had the right name, but this man, the plaintiff was so much in the public eye, he was even keeping clippings in regard his own testimony of all the stories that Ocala paper read about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.011" offset="2471372">He was an actor on the public stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.069" offset="2483597">He was trying to get people to know about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.494" offset="2497390">He was seeking publicity and because of those public activities, because of he was seeking the public eye, this new newspaper editor who had this job about a month had heard of him and he just automatically assumed when they read the name Damron over the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.204" offset="2564159">They were talking about the public figure and so he put the public figure's name in the article and wrote the article about the public figure rather than about his brother.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.871" offset="4594813">I had made my application for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the evidence and the Court at the point of discussion pointed out why I think liability as to compensatory damages is admitted in this case, not proven that the word admitted was used and this is exactly what happened and that is a reason for the candor in which this was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.950" offset="4695124">Now, the record goes on to show that the defense attorney made no objection to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.949" offset="4723127">He was only asking the Court to define what type of damages would be returnable by the jury and what findings the jury would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.936" offset="4767117">Now, in this connection, I would like to also point out that we have a very little statutory law in Florida relative to the trial of a libel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.390" offset="4816959">The statute in Florida only has to the -- directed to the award of punitive damages and provides that if a retraction is printed of the same size, type and general location in the newspaper, punitive damages will not be awarded and the jury was so instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.586" offset="4893759">As a matter of fact, they were instructed twice as shown bu the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.522" offset="4909432">However, I would like to point out to the Court that there's more to this case as shown by the record, although we did try it on the question of damages only and I refer the Court to page 75 of the appendix, relative to the testimony of Mr. Fred Myer who was the area editor and in his testimony starting about a half way down the page, in answer to a question, “now, at the best of your recollection now what word did she actually used when she called in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.512" offset="5049448">Mr. Myer, “Oh, the only word I caught was Damron and I automatically put on Leonard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.769" offset="5078497">“Why did you do that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.639" offset="5085915">“He was the only Damron I knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.237" offset="5096364">It was probably a minimal abrasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.353" offset="5108799">I just assumed that it was Leonard Damron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.336" offset="5120711">I didn't hear Leonard on the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.362" offset="5128861">I can't swear that I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.155" offset="5135966">I just heard the word Damron.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.689" offset="5150177">And the next to the last question on the page and in his capacity as mayor of Crystal River, he had been writing articles about Leonard Damron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.102" offset="5191764">We turn over to page 76 and here's where the unusual part of this case begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.844" offset="5222797">Starting on the middle of the page, question, “Well, tell me Mr. Myer, having written as many stories about Mr. Leonard Damron,” this is on cross examination incidentally, “weren't you aware that Mr. Damron was in Crystal River?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.052" offset="5331571">Answer, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.023" offset="5331466">“Mr. Myer, would you look at the dateline on the story which was published in error and answer me what is the dateline in that particular story?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.083" offset="5331362">Answer, “Inglis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.909" offset="5331257">Next question, “You had a mental aberration?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.985" offset="5335333">Question, “A man, you have been writing stories about in Crystal River, Florida and you suddenly give a story about him in Inglis, Florida and you make this change without checking. What happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.482" offset="5385279">“It so happened I did” and his next statement was “You'd spend 37 years in the newspaper business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.392" offset="5408893">I refer the Court now to page 70 of the appendix, which is the testimony of Ms. Lucy Weir who was the reporter who called in the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.086" offset="5463751">On page 70, she reads into the record the first story that was printed about James Damron in January of 1966 which is substantially correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.291" offset="5516518">Starting on page 72, that story incidentally is reprinted in part as appendix as on 85, it was attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.538" offset="5557478">Now, here's where the -- we really get to the reckless disregard and the malice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.503" offset="5589347">On page 72, second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.835" offset="5610663">This has been received in evidence as defendant's exhibit number three referring to the prior story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.195" offset="5632188">Now, what procedure, talking to Lucy Weir, “what procedure do you follow in writing a story and transmitting it to the Star-Banner, Ms. Weir?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.581" offset="5673671">Answer, “Well, I use one of two procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.506" offset="5689448">If the story is not of particular news interest, I generally type it and mail it in since the mail service is one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.351" offset="5720795">If the story is of a particular news value, I'll phone it in early in the morning.” Question, “Alright, what procedure did you follow in transmitting the particular story, “Damron cased passed over in next U.S. term,” this is the article sued upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.401" offset="5789027">“What procedure did you follow in transmitting that story to the Star-Banner for publication?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.884" offset="5806895">Answer, “I typed it first at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.852" offset="5822777">I read it over the phone the following morning, the same morning to Mr. Myer.” Next question, “And what is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.262" offset="5860394">What is the story?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.355" offset="5864782">Answer, “The story is essentially the one that I called in, the only change being that the city was changed,” referring to the dateline Gainesville where the federal court was sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.814" offset="5922670">And she fills on to state, “When I phoned in that morning, I had a Gainesville dateline which was where the action had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.330" offset="5960704">I was informed that our editor had given instructions that any story appearing on this page was an area page and should have and coming out of the area concerning the area of people, should have a dateline of the city that the people were concerned with because people read datelines rather than the text of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.618" offset="6045863">Question, “Who did you telephoned it to?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.494" offset="6057357">Answer, “Fred Myer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.984" offset="6067284">Now, it doesn't take a great deal of logic for a man to understand when Fred Myers said he had a mental aberration that this was not a true statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.864" offset="6114826">The details shown in Lucy Weir a discussion of how that story went to the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.047" offset="6131545">First of all, this was actually a reprint of a prior story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.824" offset="6154637">The standing of the prior story is shown by the make up in the appendix on pages 84 and 85 for comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.782" offset="6190477">On 85 is a first story, on 84 is a story complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.637" offset="6209912">We go back to Lucy Weir, she says that she found out about this story, typed it up that night and for some reason, unexplained, she called it in the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.601" offset="6257768">But in her conversation, we got -- they got into a big discussion about the dateline, a story being changed from Gainesville admittedly by Mr. Myer that this city was changed from Gainesville to Inglis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.968" offset="6323284">He had written many stories about the plaintiff who lived in Crystal River, was the mayor of Crystal River and he knew was in Crystal River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.125" offset="6355884">As I say, this whole text of this testimony shows conclusively when you refer back to the testimony of the plaintiff on page 30 of the appendix, down at the bottom of the page, this was a testimony of the plaintiff put on in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.528" offset="6449507">“Mr. Damron, have you ever had in the case, called Ocala Star-Banner regarding this news publication?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.433" offset="6469151">Answer, “Yes, I've called the Ocala Star-Banner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.874" offset="6482840">Question, “When did you call them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.877" offset="6490885">Answer, “Back somewhere in 1965, I believe it was about October, if I am not mistaken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.865" offset="6518784">Question, “Who did you talk with?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.787" offset="6526516">Answer, “I talked to Mr. Louis Phillips.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.479" offset="6537279">Question, “Do you know who Mr. Phillips is?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.657" offset="6545951">Answer, “Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.614" offset="6549817">Question, “Or was at that time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.206" offset="6560162">Answer, “Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.041" offset="6563506">He was the vice president publisher and that's the one I asked to speak to and I asked to speak to the general manager, Mr. Dunn, and they got me on the phone and got him on the phone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.970" offset="6607287">Question, “What was the substance of your conversation with Mr. Phillips?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.087" offset="6619721">Answer, “I asked him to send someone to Crystal River to publish a news as it happened, true facts and not editorial on the subject they write on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.445" offset="6657128">Question, “What prompted you to call the Ocala Star-Banner?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.282" offset="6668518">Answer, “So, many mistakes in the paper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.586" offset="6681684">The newspaper publisher had been informed that his publications were coming out erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.400" offset="6720972">This is the -- this as I see is a classic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.588" offset="6741765">Based on the evidence in the record, we have to go no further than to that, to show that it was malice in the publication of this story timely in the middle of an election, unlike a story which the evidence also shows was at the passing over part occurred 13 days before the news story was broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.148" offset="6827969">It was a re-publication of a prior composition of the same newspaper, published timely right in the middle of an election.</text>
