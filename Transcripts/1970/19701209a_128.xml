            <text syncTime="50.983" offset="307284">Mr. Meltsner, you may proceed I think now I’m sure you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="57.643" offset="333928">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.676" offset="346049">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina to review the court’s judgment that petitioners over 40 black youths between the ages of 11 and 15 were not entitled by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by jury in juvenile court proceedings held to determine whether they had violated state criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.250" offset="460361">Cases arose out of a conflict between black and whites in Hyde County North Carolina over the manner in which the county school board chose to implement this Court’s decision in Brown versus Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.491" offset="529324">As a result, almost the entire black population boycott at the public schools in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.122" offset="563911">During the months of September through December, the petitioners were taken into custody by state police and charged with willfully, intentionally, and unlawfully impeding highway traffic in violations of the state criminal statute which at the time of trial provided a two-year maximum penalty for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.251" offset="664325">One juvenile was charged with willfully becoming disorderly and defacing school property in violation of two other state criminal statutes which at the time of trial imposed a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.335" offset="736737">Petitioners were tried in several groups in the District Court of Hyde County -- a court of general, civil and criminal jurisdiction sitting as a juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.135" offset="783862">In each case, with the exception of the one juvenile charged with disorderly conduct and defacement of property, a police officer testified to observing groups of black youths marching and singing, carrying signs, playing catch with the basketball, all in such a manner as to stop cars on a public road.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.117" offset="871842">According to police testimony, the petitioners were warned that they were violating criminal law in order to disperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.563" offset="905592">When they did not do so, they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.296" offset="920534">The trial judge found that each petitioner had committed an act for which an adult may be punished by North Carolina law was in need of care, protection, and discipline from the state and was thereby delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.262" offset="984377">Immediately after finding petitioners delinquent, the court sentence each to a state institution for an indefinite term until released by the State Board of Juvenile Corrections or until reaching majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.803" offset="1042578">Thus, petitioners could have been incarcerated all from six to ten years respectively then the court suspended the sentence to probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.798" offset="1086568">On appeal, both the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not give the juvenile a right to trial by jury and juvenile delinquency proceedings even though he may be incarcerated for many years as a result of an adverse decision.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="264.214" offset="1160234">Now, was there any commitment to incarceration of these petitioners?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="271.241" offset="1188342">The commitment was suspended by the trial court and later excised from the judgment by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in a technical modification of the terms of the judgment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="282.428" offset="1233063">So they have never been confined?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_meltsner" startTime="284.682" stopTime="427.866">
            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="284.682" offset="1242049">No, all the petitioners were placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.006" offset="1255424">Now, these petitioners’ submission that under Gault, Winship, and Duncan taken together juvenile tried for violations of state criminal law and subjected to incarceration for years is entitled to a jury trial unless the state shows, the state has not shown here that provision of trial by jury will compel the state to displace or abandon substantial benefits conferred on the juvenile by the juvenile court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.895" offset="1402964">This is a question which we believe is seen more clearly if we first put to one side certain matters which the court is not being asked to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.395" offset="1444968">This case does not involve a jury trial where a juvenile does not want one.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.235" offset="1476315">No claim is made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.978" offset="1487287">The due process requires any change in the discretion of juvenile authorities to divert cases from court prior to trial for probation counseling action by private or public social agencies or physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.280" offset="1552488">No claim is made which restricts the juvenile court’s freedom, the structured treatment or rehabilitation to the needs of the juvenile after he has been adjudicated a delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.405" offset="1600972">No issue was present of the right to trial by jury where the juvenile is not charged with criminal conduct, faced with the stigma with of the delinquency adjudication and subjected to what amounts to punitive incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.098" offset="1663770">And finally, no claim is made that petitioners were entitled to trial in a courtroom open to the public other than by reason of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.851" offset="1710791">In short, the discretion of the trial court to exclude the public which North Carolina law now confers is not affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.944" offset="1751124">Now, petitioners contend that far from harming the juvenile, jury trial enhances liability in fairness and protects against the erroneous convictions by ensuring compliance with the reasonable-doubt standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.866" offset="1814862">Mr. Meltsner, at that point and perhaps this is an unfair question, would you hazard a guess as to what would have happened have there been a jury trial at that time in North Carolina?</text>

            <text syncTime="441.666" offset="1870033">Well, that is as Your Honor suggests, it’s quite a guess but all I can say is that this is purely a good case for jury because the events from which the criminal conduct arose are the sort of events which blacks and whites are likely to perceive in a very different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.123" offset="1963865">This case arose out of a racial clash in this community and so, well, I can’t for a moment predict what the jury would have decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.361" offset="2004825">I do think that the petitioners here would have felt that they had received the judgment of the community and found that that judgment more acceptable for that reason if it was adverse to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.881" offset="2066892">I was going to say you’d also hazard a guess then that had a jury trial been available that opportunity would have been taken in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="507.629" offset="2133870">I asked this because of the statements in the briefs that if a jury, a right to a jury trial were present that nevertheless the exercise of the right would or has been rather sparse in practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.011" offset="2195414">That is the experience of the juvenile courts in the 10 or 11 or so states which provide trial by jury has amply documented in the amicus brief of the District of Colombia Public Defender Service which survey the operation of those courts in 26 cities and towns in United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.591" offset="3353788">Now, it seems to me quite clear that the youth is as likely as an adult to profit from the protections enunciated by the court in Duncan against an arbitrary bias, corrupt or over zealous judge or prosecutor or a case hardened judge or a compliant judge one who perhaps seems to credit the least testimony because he has seen police officer testified so often against convicted defendants and likewise that the youth is also as likely as an adult to benefit from the common sense and community viewpoint of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.912" offset="3534973">In short, the jury is a check on the vast powers in the trial judge and no judge -- no trial judge has more power than the judge of the juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.252" offset="3592338">And the judge who the youth gets in exchange for his right to jury trial is a judge who is not the miracle worker of juvenile court theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.449" offset="4005177">Under North Carolina law as it presently exist now, the youth is subject to the jurisdiction of the court until he is 21 except incarceration will terminate at age 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.925" offset="4059094">Unless the State Board of Juvenile Correction certifies that the youth is in a special program, a vocational training program so should be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.483" offset="4097337">So the extent of the sanction does vary with age although the juvenile courts topped jurisdictional age as 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.692" offset="4134118">So there's always going to be at least two years which the youth will be subject to some form of sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.916" offset="4183019">Certainly, the youth is benefited by having a jury administered the reasonable-doubt standard which this Court held he was entitled to in Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.522" offset="4229413">Reasonable doubt was formulated as a standard to be administered by the jury and it is plainly a higher burden for the prosecution to persuade 6 or 12 men to a subjective standard of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.838" offset="4310706">In addition to the weight of numbers, the jury gives content to reasonable doubt by making sure that men with different backgrounds and perspectives and outlooks concur in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.316" offset="4364622">Now there are certain benefits which the jury trial gives which I think are specially seen in juvenile court because the juvenile judge is bombarded with inadmissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.216" offset="4416240">Evidence that come to him if he holds the waiver hearing which I mentioned before or evidence which comes to him by reading social reports describing the youth’s family and background which North Carolina law explicitly permits him to see before adjudication, before he has made a final determination of delinquency by Section 7A-285.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.790" offset="4522506">These reports are that the access of the judge has to these reports is easy because he even hires and fires the man who accumulate the information of the probation officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.971" offset="4579244">A second reason why the jury trial is in especially appropriate protection for the youth juvenile court is that the juvenile judge has traditionally seen himself as acting on the needs rather than the deeds of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.132" offset="4651865">Thus, he is more likely to see a finding of delinquency as a prelude to treatment rather than punishment and I would submit, it will be more difficult for him to hold the balance true when applying the reasonable-doubt standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.662" offset="4710066">It simply easier to convict given human nature when you believe that some good called rehabilitation is presently practiced by the States is a benefit to the youth and will follow adjudication of delinquency.</text>
