            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">We'll hear arguments in number 58, United States against the Book Bin.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.275" offset="33019">Mr. Strauss, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="11.873" offset="47438">If I may just --Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.963" offset="67814">Obviously, this case concerns the same legal questions and so I will be making a continuous argument in that sense, but if I may just a moment, correct a couple that I think a factual overstatement regarding the case just concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.506" offset="129985">My understanding is that the stays which are in effect concerning the mail received by the mailbox in this case were consented to or at least not opposed by Mr. Fleishman on behalf of his client and -- well, he may have given a contrary impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.315" offset="201247">The original orders in this case came on as a result of unsolicited advertisement which the Post Inspectors received from the mailbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.544" offset="242103">Now proceeding to the Book Bin then I think my statement may be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.380" offset="265509">Appellee advertises and sells through the mail and like the mailbox, a substantial number of publications of the character suggested by the advertising exhibit reproduced at pages 58 and 59 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.954" offset="319739">A Section 4006 proceeding was brought against the Book Bin alleging that one of these publications entitled Novels of France was obscene and on June 6, 1969, the government sought a Section 4007 protective order in United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.144" offset="392568">Appellees counterclaimed for an injunction forbidding enforcement of Sections 4006 and 4007.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.257" offset="417019">A three-judge District Court was convened and granted the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.585" offset="434260">The Court found that the procedures for examining mail possibly connected with the challenged publication were overbroad and that the procedures generally failed to meet the standards of Freedman versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.106" offset="480340">On the government's appeal, this Court noted probable jurisdiction on March 2 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.877" offset="507507">If I may go -- turn first and I realize Mr. Justice Harlan that your question regarding the scope of relief in this case remains open and is perhaps the most serious of the questions in this case, but I do want first to examine briefly the other procedures of Section 4007, the operative procedures as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.273" offset="593084">The procedures that put in an operation because the scope of relief question is really shared with Section 4006.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.899" offset="627566">Section 4007 as I stated at the beginning of the prior case is basically a reference to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.884" offset="671451">It entitles the government to get interim relief against the distribution of the magazines of this type or against fraudulent enterprises and circumstances in which such relief could be obtained under Rule 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.899" offset="727562">That means among other things that the proceedings cannot be ex-parte and therefore, the consideration, which principally I think animated this Court's decision or the concern I suppose, which principally animated this Court's decision in Kingsley Books and subsequent opinions construing that case as absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.834" offset="819304">In addition, there is the necessity of showing a probable cause in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.069" offset="856189">First to believe that the magazines are obscene and that would be a judicial finding and second a probable cause to believe that indeed, the government will be irreparably injured, that there is some need for emergency relief and Kingsley Books spoke to both of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.865" offset="947409">The Court said at page 440 of volume 354 of the report, “Authorization of an injunction pendente lite as part of this scheme during the period within which the issue of obscenity must be promptly tried and adjudicated in an adversary proceeding for which adequate notice, judicial hearing and fair determination are assured is a safeguard against frustration of the public interest in effectuating the judicial condemnation of obscene matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.519" offset="1058064">It is a break on the temptation to exploit a filthy business offered by the limited hazards of piecemeal prosecutions sale by sale of a publication already condemned as obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.993" offset="1107905">And I think Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurrence characterizing it accurately in his dissent rather in quantity of books, stated the grounds that were important to that decision and into the distinction of that decision that was made by this Court in the Market case -- excuse me, on the Marcus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.249" offset="1204976">First, that the court could exercise an independent check on the judgment of the prosecuting authority at the point before any restraint took place, second that the restraints ran only against the named publication, third, that no extensive restraints were imposed before an adversary proceeding and fourth, that the New York code required decision within two days of the trial on the obscenity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.046" offset="1300167">Now, the only issue regarding those four statements in this case I believe is the matter of time and it is the government's position basically that that question is adequately controlled by the power which a court of equity always retains to modify its judgment when subsequent events show that indeed, the person against whom a temporary restraint runs is being improperly or unfairly injured by the pendency of the proceedings by the continuation of the relief during a period of undue delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.189" offset="1456692">In that respect, I would like to clear up some confusion which I think may exist regarding the relationship that we see between Section 4007 and 4006.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.731" offset="1502877">4006 in no event takes effect before a final administrative decision has been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.532" offset="1538090">Once a final administrative decision has been reached, it does take effect of its own force and without need for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.432" offset="1581662">The person against whom the order is entered may then seek review as was done in these cases essentially and the issue then is what is the affect of that petition for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.227" offset="1632862">The government's position, principle position is that that petition for review operates to convert the Section 4006 order into what is in effect a Section 4007 order, an order impounding the mail for the duration of the proceedings to challenge the administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.013" offset="1720007">So that there would be no return of the mail once an appeal had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.172" offset="1740591">Now, there might be in the intervening period some slight length of time during which mail would be returned or would in that sense and some --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="443.366" stopTime="446.862">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="443.366" offset="1773401">And it's after the final administrative order and before the appeal during that period?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="446.862" stopTime="525.642">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="446.862" offset="1787402">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.825" offset="1795239">During that brief period, the length of that period is in counsel's control and I am sure that if representations were made that an appeal would be taken that an appropriate stay would be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.787" offset="1847066">It takes time to transmit these orders after all from Washington where they are entered to the postmasters out in the field and if such a stay wouldn't be entered, I'm sure this Court and other courts would be quick to grant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.984" offset="1899833">So that that is the necessary affect of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.909" offset="1911536">And now, we say in addition although we don't urge it but if the Court feels that incumbent upon it, it would not disturb the statutory scheme in view of the history of Section 4007 to say that the appeal has a more radical effect, that is that it suspends any impact whatever of the administrative order and leaves the government completely dependent on it's ability to get a judicial order under Section 4007.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.644" offset="2022504">So that under that second reading, I think you were correct Mr. Justice Stewart in your question that there would be no burden so far as Section 4006 is concerned on the person subject to the order other than the burden of filing his appeal and seeing to it that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="534.591" offset="2138279">Now, I'm talking about Section 4007 and which need not -- the government I think need not wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.013" offset="2176000">I don't mean to suggest that the government cannot invoke Section 4007 before there has been an administrative decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="577.579" offset="2310269">So that there will be possibly a period of time during which there is not yet any administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.085" offset="2340258">There could not yet be any administrative restraint, but there maybe a judicial order outstanding which does impose a restraint of impounding the mail.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="593.619" offset="2374426">And of course that too is appealable?</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="595.490" stopTime="884.810">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="595.490" offset="2381949">Of course that's appealable and maybe stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.369" offset="2397414">It requires as I have said before that the judge have the specific material before him and that he inspect them and determine that there is at least probable cause to believe that they are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.916" offset="2447569">And indeed, that was precisely the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.318" offset="2461257">If the Court will see we have reproduced it at the rear of our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.632" offset="2486439">The temporary restraining order which preliminary injunction which were in fact entered in the Mailbox case and the Court will see that they refer specifically to the seven magazines which were at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.716" offset="2542864">And I may say too, Kingsley itself is probably sufficient authority or a sufficient demonstration of the need for this sort of pendente lite relief, if it were necessary to give anymore, the question arose with regard to the specific provision of Section 4006.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.929" offset="2639621">Before passage of Section 4007, the Postmaster General attempted to forge his own impoundment authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.056" offset="2676193">He was ultimately unsuccessful in the Court of Appeal, but in the interim a motion for stay came before Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.725" offset="2714854">He wrote a lengthy opinion which is reported and commented on by the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.633" offset="2734498">What's notable about that action I think is that he did not interfere with the impoundment that he acknowledged that there are many situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.860" offset="2771383">One of the burdens of litigation may be putting things aside for the time in order to preserve the status quo and that was Standard versus Olsen which is reported in the Supreme Court report Volume 74, at page 768.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.754" offset="2858945">So as I say, the principal things to be said here are that there is this need to -- that the government must show probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.532" offset="2898024">It must show a need for emergency relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.407" offset="2909623">There is complete judicial control over the period of time during which the order remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.226" offset="2936895">It is at once appealable on the issues of probable cause and need for emergency relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.668" offset="2958629">There is the constant possibility of modification and we submit that all of this would be sufficient to establish the correctness of the procedure even if what were involved was some form of censorship, but of course that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.530" offset="3018083">It's a simple postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.131" offset="3028428">The mailbox man for all we know, or the Book Bin may and for all we know has continued to solicit orders and those orders come in and are kept and at the conclusion of the period of time, they may indeed be received.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.704" offset="3094779">There is nothing to prevent the Mailbox or the Book Bin from re-circulating their lists with a letter saying “Perhaps you didn't receive some orders that you sent to list.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.830" offset="3139291">We want you to know we are in this trouble.”</text>
            <text syncTime="787.184" offset="3148696">While in many industries, advertisement of troubles like that might not be to commercial advantage, it seems to me at least conceivable that in this industry, it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.471" offset="3205851">There is a further point that Mr. Justice Harlan has averted to in some of his decisions and that is that there is involved in these materials here unlike movies that communicate ideas or political speeches that have a certain timeliness still in the materials of the sort involved in this case really carry no urgency of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.668" offset="3298638">Whatever, they are essentially timeless as the Court knows from the descriptions of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.610" offset="3334374">There is against that balance to the need of the government for relief if the scheme of the statute is to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.645" offset="3374498">Now, if I may turn to what I've called the Lamont issues which I think I would agree were -- are the more troublesome in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.324" offset="3409293">Still it does seem to me that they were principally settled by the decision of this Court in Donaldson because as to this question, the way in which an order interferes or may interfere with a person's incoming mail, it seems to me the effect of this order is indistinguishable from the orders which were -- from the mail which was involved in the Donaldson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.945" offset="3675742">Of course it doesn't in that sense suppress or remove the materials from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.184" offset="3696640">It does remove them from this one particular market.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.790" offset="3723076">In this respect, as I say, I think the order is essentially of the same impact and it's essentially indistinguishable from the situation in Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.902" offset="3767589">I might remind the Court and that while it maybe unusual, nonetheless in Donaldson the Court was dealing indeed with a magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.121" offset="3800398">Fax Magazine, Reed Magazine and these are magazines with subscription lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.807" offset="3823177">These were magazines which undoubtedly had persons writing to them for proper purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.391" offset="3845538">As the case started out, the order entered against the magazines in question was quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.579" offset="3874273">The Court was evidently, properly I would say alarmed at the breath of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.370" offset="3897469">It heard argument once and then set the case for re-argument specifically on the question of the breath of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.473" offset="3921816">In the interim, the order was modified and the Court then concluded that with that modification, a modification which essentially narrowed the orders so that its predictable impact was principally on the transactions in question that the order was not overbroad and indeed was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.966" offset="4015856">The problems here stem from the necessity of honoring the privacy of the mail in the sense that the government may not open a person's domestic first class mail out of his presence and that means that if the statutory remedy is to be applied, it must either be applied against all mail incoming to the person which we don't assert would be proper and do not attempt or there must be some provision made for an inspection procedure and the provision for an inspection procedure is what at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.310" offset="4165172">I don't think it is irrelevant to point out that here as distinct from a case like Lamont, we are not dealing with an innocent party whom the government presumes to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.119" offset="4208431">But we are dealing with an individual who has either been adjudicated or whom it has been adjudicated that there is probable cause to believe that he is using the mails for an illegal improper purpose and it is upon the basis of that adjudication, a specific adjudication directed to him, directed after adversary proceedings fully consonant with due process that this remedy is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.799" offset="4319190">Now, the order of course is a restraint in some respects but that is a restraint which can readily be reduced in its impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.565" offset="4366211">Commercial publishing houses, commercial mailers regularly use special forms of address in connection with their order blanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.567" offset="4398184">Where that is done only envelopes addressed to that special form of address are intercepted and detained or returned as the case maybe and again, that was the situation in Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.271" offset="4460983">As a practical reality, there are not terribly many situations where an individual would receive private mail or anything of that sort at a commercial address which would be used in this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.328" offset="4521273">There are for the specific provisions made for “For waiting” mail without interference which appears from its cover not to be related to the specific publications which have been adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.880" offset="4571429">And in sum as I think is demonstrated by the Donaldson opinion, there maybe a problem in particular cases about an order being overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.963" offset="4607791">I think there is not a problem about the statute necessarily being so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.956" offset="4635794">Even the inspection itself when it occurs I might point out, it need not and in fact probably is not in the realities of this situation to be a reading of the person's mail as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.315" offset="4685218">We know that the way these publishing houses operate is on a cash basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.033" offset="4708101">They do not accept orders COD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.074" offset="4720222">Consequently, any letter which when opening was found to include no check would immediately be a candidate for passage on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.600" offset="4754390">There's no necessity to see whether it's an order or not what knows it on the basis of this type of commercial reality or usually, there will be order blanks or something else of the sort which would also serve in identifying function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.820" offset="4943203">But I must say that certainly in this Court's practice, it does seem to come principally down to a matter of inspecting the materials themselves and to the extent that that is the test, of course, there s no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.375" offset="5065456">I might say that again, that there are substantial interests on the government's side warranting this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.522" offset="5102028">Whatever certificates of age there maybe in the mail, it is nonetheless impossible to know whether in fact the person is saying that he is 21, is 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.597" offset="5146331">If you sell this material over the counter, you can at least make some obvious sorts of differentiations along that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.133" offset="5180500">There is the need I think recognized by Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in Memoirs for cooperating in the sense, in a sense with the states who are inhibiting the spread of this material which all states of the union find obnoxious and within constitutional bounds properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.110" offset="5272346">And as Kingsley itself recognized, that cannot effectively be done without some form of restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.995" offset="5299931">There is the matter of post office involvement indeed with what is in offense under the laws of the United States and the time for the prosecution of a criminal case again, there's a time during which the material may continue to be sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.549" offset="5354162">In sum, I believe this is a remedy which is as narrow as possible under the exigent circumstances of the act, something which this Court indicated in the Burrstone case, it would consider as a proper consideration in passing unconstitutionality of regulation in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.925" offset="5439634">A few concluding observations that I'd like to make regarding this Court's decision in Stanley and the meaning that ought to be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.492" offset="5481953">I think the government's approach or understanding of that opinion maybe reflected not only in Griswold versus Connecticut but perhaps better than elsewhere in the language of Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe versus Ullman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.165" offset="5548617">We are not presented simply with the moral judgment to be passed on as an abstract proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.575" offset="5570247">A secular state is not an examiner of consciences and must operate in the realm of behavior of overt actions and where it does so operate, not only the underlying moral purpose of it's operations but also the choice of means becomes relevant to any constitutional judgment on what is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.176" offset="5644643">I believe that Stanley was a decision about the choice of means for regulating obscenity and as such, the government has no qualms with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.877" offset="5683409">I do not believe as the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.321" offset="5693231">It was not that the opinion was amended in any way to interfere with general government regulation in this particular area, but someone suggested that the Roth opinion has proved the debacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.668" offset="5750596">I find it hard to imagine remembering back to what was available on the news stands and through the mails in 1957 in considering what is there now that is was a debacle at least for anyone on the side of the fence represented by the person who made the observation nor do I think that the issue with social value can be equated with monetary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.290" offset="5853100">No one suggested and surely the authors of the Roth opinion understood that obscenity was handed out for no compensation because people wouldn't pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.472" offset="5893851">Obviously it has some social value in that sense, but I do not think any value which has been suggested for it amounts to the type of value which the Court was discussing in Roth, a value connected with ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.125" offset="5948500">Counsel has made a great deal of our brief in Rowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.764" offset="5963024">Those quotes were taken widely out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.784" offset="5979115">They were principally quotations which the government itself had made in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.340" offset="6001267">One for example was from our statement of facts at page six where we quoted a member of the House of Representatives who was explaining his Bill and other was from the Harvard Law Review and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.859" offset="6051422">The principle thing to be noted about the government's position in that case is that that deals with the statute which has much wider impact than on materials which this Court has held may constitutionally be designated obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.100" offset="6100323">And in that wider area where the individual may very well believe and many individuals do believe that materials this Court has held are not obscene and nonetheless objectionable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.686" offset="7002697">The advertising brochure sent out to a postal inspector, I call the Court's attention to on page 58 and 59 of the appendix, has a notation at the top right hand corner and the date 2/4/69, February 4, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.225" offset="7096842">Now, in the context of this particular case, what thereafter occurred is nothing for four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.949" offset="7123696">And then in June, approximately June 6, a motion is filed -- a petition is filed, to complain before the judicial hearing officer as well as a motion for expedited hearing because of the tremendous danger suggested in this particular regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.728" offset="7190883">And then almost instantaneously, a motion is made under 4007 to have the court declare a probable cause that this material is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.199" offset="7228709">But yet four months went by under the scheme as it operated by the government's own exhibit as put into this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.468" offset="7261832">And, we point out to the Court, the material, the magazine Models de France which in 19 -- which was the subject of the 1969 proceedings was no more candid than the magazine that this Court found not obscene applying the Redrup concept in exclusive in the magazine case involving exclusive or titled Central Magazine Sales versus United Sates in October of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.427" offset="7369665">So this is two -- almost two years later -- a year-and-a-half-later, there is an attempt to take one magazine out of an entire brochure and we suggest that these are separate factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.732" offset="7422851">In this particular context, what occurred is a US Attorney sent a letter to the Book Bin, telling them that he was going to move for a temporary restraining order and counsel appeared at the time and shortly thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the application as well as asking for a three-judge court to declare the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.278" offset="7509055">It is true in this case, there was no time any mail stopped because of the action of counsel in this particular regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.987" offset="7543850">And in that context, we say this is the difference between this case and the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.587" offset="7566315">Now, we divide our argument into several parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.576" offset="7582302">First is the concept of whether the administrative proceedings here are appropriate under the First Amendment, dealing with presumably protected publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.764" offset="7627024">We have, as we suggested, a post office proceeding that does not have an adversary concept before a judicial officer, a court, that what occurs is that the publication is displayed and an affidavit is obtained by the general counsel, the materials are then submitted to the hearing examiner who then dockets a complaint and goes forward from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.773" offset="7755024">Now, in this instance, there is no expertise suggested in this hearing officer as you've heard, 80% of his time is spent in matters relating to contracts for post office buildings that the proceedings at that time, there's no time period within which the hearing must be convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.569" offset="7830256">There is no time period as we would suggest is required under the decisions of this Court in Title Film Corporation and in Freedman within which there must be a prompt judicial determination and we say that in this regard, this is a failure in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.160" offset="7908624">Then there is no obviously no jury in the context of the administrative proceedings that can determine whether or not something is or is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.051" offset="7948121">And we suggest the publications in the Mailbox case were determined by that same hearing -- acting judicial officer to be obscene as Mr. Fleishman indicated counsel that these were comparable to the materials in Bloss and we suggest they were also comparable to the materials in the Central Magazine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.426" offset="8021682">So in that particular context, we say that they are not -- these are not appropriate procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.487" offset="8053864">Now, in the -- in the context of a 4007 order, we suggest that there are several deficiencies in that particular Section which are special to the Book Bin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.395" offset="8125544">First is what is probable cause or what is the probable cause test?</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.205" offset="8140800">There is no guide left as to what is the probable cause in the context of a 4007 hearing because in that instance, are we talking about an opportunity -- a reasonable opportunity to be heard?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.914" offset="8199628">Is one day or two days sufficient?</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.110" offset="8208405">This is not a kind of situation like Carroll versus President and Commissioners of Princess Anne County wherein a speech was about to be heard that almost the next evening or that evening and that there was emergency concepts involved and there was no opportunity -- there could've been an opportunity to be heard and an immediate hearing could've been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.382" offset="8285518">In this context, they waited as we suggested from February until June and then they moved for an immediate hearing and we say that unlike Carroll versus President and Commissioners of Princess Anne County, there was no overriding emergency and in this regard what is probable cause consistent with due process?</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.523" offset="8354064">Is it one or two days notice to go in and be prepared to demonstrate one's case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.041" offset="8376111">In this particular regard, we also go on to the fact that there is no reasonable construction that could obtain to save what we consider to be an unconstitutional mail block requiring an affirmative action on the part of the addressee under the doctrine suggested by this Court in Lamont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.027" offset="8444029">The order, yes, suggested could be drawn very narrowly and that a postal inspector could be delegated to sit down with the addressee on a day by day basis, sort through every piece of mail there to determine whether any of the material alleged to be obscene could be determined -- could be released to them and only that material which was not would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.462" offset="8541832">So, we suggest that this in effect creates a chilling effect or self censorship which we feel this Court has condemned on numerous and prior occasions that the trial court or the three-judge court suggests that under the broad wording of the statute, that under a 4770 order that the United States could obtain a court order detaining all incoming mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.639" offset="8638485">However, as has been suggested by the Solicitor General, that could be somewhat reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.332" offset="8669309">We get in part two the concept that this Court, as Mr. Fleishman has discussed, Mr. Strauss has discussed with respect to Roth and its applicability in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.489" offset="8721868">We are -- in essence, we say that an individual has a right to receive material which to him is for his amusement value or for the conveyance of ideological content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.482" offset="8769829">The individual asserts that right by ordering merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.933" offset="8783726">Now, it is not suggested, we say that this brochure necessarily goes to an unwilling or to an unsolicited individual and he then responds by ordering a magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.857" offset="8831373">There are a variety of ways that this man can get on the mailing list so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.812" offset="8851226">He can buy a publication that is put out by a firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.611" offset="8862407">He may have an advertisement in there and he may write and say “Send me your brochure” and the brochure is send in response to this and in kind than the publication is sent to him after he orders from the brochure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.227" offset="8904829">And this is in effect the part of the people like the Book Bin or the Mailbox trying to follow what is suggested or what has been suggested by this Court in the treatment of the Redrup cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.049" offset="8956134">Whereas are we dealing with an individual who wants to avoid exposure to adult type materials and if this is the unsolicited intrusive mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.678" offset="8998661">But if John Doe, postal inspector wants to go in a Mailbox list and he wants to buy adult type of material from the Mailbox and ultimately as this Court recognized in Rowan, there is an exchange of list in every commercial enterprise in mail order that if ultimately, what occurs is that this list is exchanged and he then gets an advertisement from the Book Bin or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.634" offset="9082462">He is not in the category of the individual who says “I wanted to avoid confrontation with this kind of material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.953" offset="9111719">He is not that particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.270" offset="9117048">So we're not -- it's not a solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.798" offset="9127184">It's just sent out widespread which seems to us to have been suggested in the Stanley case when the Court took particular pains as this counsel reads it, to point out in a footnote a quotation from the various cases and said, “The Court found it” -- this is on page 548 of the lawyer's edition, “The Court found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional questions presented by the claimant, but did notice the belief that the statement in Roth concerning the rejection of obscenity must be interpreted in light of the widespread distribution of the material in Roth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.265" offset="9289038">And again later in the particular case, this Court -- in the Stanley case, this Court has reiterated what it was said in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in Roth, the door barring federal and state intrusions, this area cannot be left ajar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.022" offset="9348075">It must be kept tightly closed and open to slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.945" offset="9371690">And at that particular point, there was a footnote which led us back ultimately to Breard versus City of Alexandria would seem to be an expression of the kind of intrusion that we were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.658" offset="9414531">That certain material could be disseminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.486" offset="9425920">Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested in Ginsburg versus U.S. that unless the material is hardcore, certainly there should be some intrusive quality about the nature of it's dissemination before it should be prohibited, at least that's as this counsel has read the particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.886" offset="9491540">So we're not -- we're in this particular position that we are not engaged in a widespread indiscriminate circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.538" offset="9526126">We have an individual who by one form or the other has gotten onto a mailing list, who was indicated by his prior correspondence or such that he wants to receive adult type material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.542" offset="9570116">The characterization by Mr. Strauss as this being, you know, that these people are in a particular industry or they're involved with the monetary aspect, everyone is involved in the monetary aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.974" offset="9611807">In this regard, these people have suggested they want to receive something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.546" offset="9626122">They want to order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.367" offset="9629466">They write to the Book Bin to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.860" offset="9643363">The post office department comes in and decides that they shouldn't get it for one reason or the other a particular publication which was known to them to be at least comparable to the material before this Court in the Exclusive case, not even as candid as the material in the Bloss case, later determined by this Court I think on June 1, 197 --</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.313" offset="10081176">The burden for instituting judicial review at the conclusion of a post office determination is on the addressee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2541.797" offset="10167171">We say -- we suggest that that is in violation of the Title Film Corporation which was in essence bottomed on Freedman versus Maryland, that the burden of carrying persuasion certainly by virtue of an administrative determination of obscenity would then be on the person seeking to reverse or change that particular thing in the judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.764" offset="10247001">And we say that these things are inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.957" offset="10267794">And as to 4007, there is no standard as to determination of what probable cause is and the probable cause issue, once the Court finds probable cause whether it's to the -- under any standard could something be said to be obscene under any test could something be said to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.555" offset="10346162">If the Court follows that as to the issue of probable cause, then we have something tied up, we have correspondence tied up, we have obviously a chilling effect we suggest Your Honor on the exercise of First Amendment freedom and it is the public that in great measure is deprived.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.114" offset="10812395">So we say that as to the Lamont issue, we feel it controls as written and we feel certainly that the Freedman factors as argued control as written.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.748" offset="11230981">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.338" offset="11233280">Regarding the question of the amount of time these proceedings might take, I think there's one further observation I might make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.684" offset="11262642">I've already suggested that this is always under judicial control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.046" offset="11280091">I would also suggest as I believe we have in a footnote to our brief that it is indistinguishable from the question how long shall a criminal prosecution take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.977" offset="11315827">This Court has never suggested that once and indictment is brought in an obscenity case, that case must be listed -- lifted on the calendar over cases involving prosecutions for murder or interstate bank theft, of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.807" offset="11379148">Similarly here, simply because an administrative complaint may have been filed, that fact alone doesn't introduce any particular compulsions of time, although the existence of a Section 4007 order might.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.933" offset="11439647">Finally, I should just like to remind the Court of footnote 22 in the interstate circuit opinion again, in which the court did indicate I think clearly that the simple burden of an administrative act to avoid default was not the kind of burden which was involved in the Freedman holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.476" offset="11505894">On these grounds, we suggest that the decisions in both of these cases must be reversed.</text>
