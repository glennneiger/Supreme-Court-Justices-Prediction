            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments in number 55, Blount against Rizzi Doing Business As The Mailbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.171" offset="272071">Mr. Strauss.</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="43.261" stopTime="519.293">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="43.261" offset="276459">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.452" offset="297148">In this case, a three-judge District Court sitting in the Central District of California has held Section 4006 of the Postal Code unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.714" offset="346258">In the Book Bin case which immediately follows, another such Court sitting in the Northern District to Georgia also held Section 4006 unconstitutional on its face together with Section 4007 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.838" offset="406758">And because of the similarity of the issues, the government filed a single jurisdictional statement, brief and appendix and I believe that will be helpful now to make a statement in sufficient detailed to illuminate the issue in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.481" offset="465272">And I say parenthetically that while I will continue to refer to the statute of Sections 4005 and 4006 under the Postal Reform Act passed in the middle of the summer, they are now actually Section or they will shortly be Sections 3005 and 3006, but they are otherwise unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.961" offset="551267">The decisions in both Courts were limited to procedural questions arising under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.678" offset="578121">While the papers for appellees contended that the publications in question are not obscene, my understanding is that the proceedings never reached that point and that in fact neither of the three-judge courts which decided these cases ever had the magazines in issue before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.786" offset="646562">The decisions assumed that the traffic in obscenity could be barred from the mails and considered only whether these two Sections were constitutionally appropriate procedures for accomplishing that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.511" offset="693373">Section 4006 provides that when the postmaster general finds the person as using the mails to sell or advertise obscene matter, he may issue an administrative order intercepting mail addressed to that person and directing that it be returned to the sender marked as unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.126" offset="767875">The Section and its remedy are almost precisely the same as that provided in Section 4005 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.571" offset="801625">Again, now we numbered Section 3005, dealing with the use of the mails to promote fraudulent enterprises, a Section which this Court has twice sustained most recently an opinion my Mr. Justice Black in Donaldson versus Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.656" offset="878007">Administrative proceedings under Section 4006 again are governed by the same regulations as are used in broad proceedings under Section 4005.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.819" offset="922624">Section 4007 governs preliminary juridical relief for both Section 4005 and Section 4006.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.064" offset="963584">The regulations concerned that to govern the administrative proceedings are set out and extend so and in appendix to our jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.593" offset="1001723">Under these regulations, the statute has much narrower scope than might at first appeared from its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.462" offset="1025233">Proceedings start when the Postmaster General discovers that possibly obscene matter is being sold or advertised through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.785" offset="1058461">There is, that is no obligation to submit any material to him for clearance of any kind or for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.009" offset="1091375">After complaint and notice a trial type administrative hearing, fully complying with the Administrative Procedure Act is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.039" offset="1123558">In that hearing, the Government not only has the burden of initiating it by complaint, but also of establishing the obscenity of the materials or the fraudulent nature of the materials challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.702" offset="1170160">During the period in which the hearings are taking twice, unless there has been judicial relief under Section 4007, the mailer continuous to receive his mail completely unimpeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.092" offset="1219688">The hearing officer is a regular departmental examiner whose time typically is principally devoted to contractual issues and other departmental matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.359" offset="1256782">He is required to write as full an opinion on as carefully preserved a record as any Federal District Judge would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.025" offset="1291473">The regulations urge speed in conducting the hearings and disposing of the complaint, but again it is only when a final administrative determination has been made that the item sold or advertised are indeed obscene that any step can be taken by the post office on the basis of the administrative proceedings to interdict the defendant’s mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.488" offset="1377364">Like these procedures, the order entered by the Postmaster in a Section 4006 case is identical in form and in execution to that which is entered in fraud cases under Section 4005.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.482" offset="1429295">It directs the Postmaster to remove from the mail and return to the sender appropriately stamped, all mail connected with the items which have been found obscene or fraudulent as the case maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.926" offset="1479032">It also directs the Postmaster to refuse to honor postal money orders drawn in payment for these items or in response to the fraudulent enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.326" offset="1516648">It maybe clear from the form of address used or from information on the envelope that some mail is unconnected with the adjudicated items.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.884" offset="1550921">That mail is immediately delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.259" offset="1560430">The rest generally speaking, the Postmaster cannot inspect on its own but since the constitution and statutes protect first class mail from such inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.299" offset="1600554">It is therefore held that the post office for inspection by the addressee and anything not concerned with the adjudicated items will be delivered to him when he inspects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.478" offset="1649246">Only mail which is connected with the adjudicated items or which is not inspected within a reasonable time, they are stamped and returned to the sender marked as the statute directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.772" offset="1694490">Once the Section 4006 order has become final in administrative proceedings, the order goes into effect automatically without any need for judicial enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.493" offset="1737331">Review maybe sought however in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.178" offset="1752064">And in order to describe the effect that we believe that review has on the administrative order, it will be helpful to turn now to Section 4007 which is principally at issue here in the second of these two cases, the Book Bin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.526" offset="1805458">Section 4007 provides for preliminary judicial relief during the pendency of administrative proceedings under both the fraud and the obscenity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.578" offset="1849657">It has been prominently used in fraud cases and it might be instructive to give an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.158" offset="1875989">An advertisement was recently paste -- placed in a California Newspaper offering a very low cost to Hawaii vacation if the person responding would only send a $25.00 registration fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.481" offset="1933249">The post office, suspecting fraud and able to convince District Judge that there was probable cause to believe that the advertisement was fraudulent, obtained a Section 4007 order and under that order was able to intercept $250,000.00 in remittances that had been sent to the advertiser who indeed did prove as I understand to be conducting a fraudulent campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.613" offset="2041814">Similarly in a Section 4006 case, that is in an obscenity case use of a Section 4007 order might be proper or helpful in preventing widespread dissemination of the materials concerned before administrative proceedings could be complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.252" offset="2132407">Procedures under Section 4007 are those which govern interim injunctive relief generally in Federal Courts and in particular those specified by rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="519.293" offset="2180577">Mr. Strauss, let me be sure I get the procedure in this interception case that you speak of, the tourist travel fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.094" offset="2219760">The mail is impounded in that interim period, I take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.685" offset="2242121">That preserves phrases of the situation until final decision, is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="539.332" stopTime="557.282">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="539.332" offset="2260720">Correct and of course the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.036" offset="2271483">The mailer may continue to, when I speak of the mailer, the person against whom the order is directed, may continue to advertise, and may continue solicit remittances and if he ultimately prevails well he will receive all those orders and remittances.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="557.282" stopTime="564.863">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="557.282" offset="2332505">But are mailing -- is the remittances are impounded and the mailings impounded as well?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="564.863" stopTime="1042.575">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="564.863" offset="2362807">Any letter to him would be dealt with in the same way as under the statute except that it wouldn’t be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.669" offset="2390079">That is mail which clearly was not connected with the enterprise would be delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.275" offset="2412440">A mail which might be would be held for inspection and could be removed if it was found not to be connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.615" offset="2445876">The relationship of the statute to Rule 65, I think is significant because of that Section's limitations on the possibility of ex parte relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.197" offset="2484120">If the Government knows the mailer's address for the purpose of getting relief under Section 4007, that obviously also knows his address for the purpose serving notice of those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.883" offset="2526856">And for these reasons, such proceedings can never be ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.025" offset="2543470">In order to justify interim relief, the government must produce the material thought to obscene and must satisfy the judge that there is probable cause to believe that it is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.009" offset="2587460">The interim relief granted as I just explained is the impounding of the incoming mail with delivery of mail which seems not to be concerned with the enterprise in question and possible delivery of other mail with an inspection it is found not to have to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.161" offset="2659976">In addition, as in the case of all interim relief in this nature, there is always available through judicial processes, the possibility of modification of the order when either delay or other circumstances would tend to warrant that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.447" offset="2737194">Because Section 4007, if I may return now to Section 4006, because Section 4007 provides only for impounding the mail during review of an administrative order and Section 4007 specifically states that it is preliminary relief both during the administrative proceedings and during any appeal there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.433" offset="2837086">Because Section 4007 provides only for impounding of the mail during review of the order, we have interpreted Section 4006 as subject to the same limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.968" offset="2883271">That is if review of the Section 4006 order is sought, the post office can only impound incoming mail until its order has been judicially approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.388" offset="2924962">The statute on its face is subject to the contrary interpretation and indeed if no review were sought, the post office believes that the Section 4006 orders immediately effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.953" offset="2975222">But we think the necessary consequence of Section 4007 is at least that where review of the Section 4006 order is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.507" offset="3021406">That has the effect of transmuting the relief for the interim to simple impoundment only when judicial approval has been obtained were review is sought, could the post office begin to return mail to the sender stamped as the statute directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.026" offset="3087444">And indeed as we point out in our brief, one of the possibilities open in this case, we don’t urge it, but we don’t believe it would wrench the statute if it we’re necessary, would be to give an even more restrictive interpretation to Section 4006 and hold that where review is sought no effect could be given to Section 4006 order so that interim relief would depend entirely on the availability and the obtaining of judicial relief under Section 4007.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.752" offset="3214399">Turning very briefly to the facts of this particular case, appellee publishes advertises and sells through the mails a variety of magazines to the character described in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.180" offset="3256090">In the fall of 1968, the Postmaster General become aware of seven of these in particular and directed that Section 4006 proceedings be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.491" offset="3293288">A complaint was filed and an administrative hearing set for December 3, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.555" offset="3317635">On the same day as the hearing December 3, the post office secured the temporary restraining order under Section 4007 specifically limited to the seven magazines charged on the basis of the finding of probable cause to believe them obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.193" offset="3380120">On December 31, the judicial officer filed the length of the opinion, set out as an appendix to our brief and our jurisdictional statement finding that each of the magazines was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.760" offset="3422438">Appellee then brought this injunctive action to bar enforcement of the resulting administrative order.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.480" offset="3445321">A three-judge court was convened and held Section 4006 unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.398" offset="3468936">The sole stated ground of decision was that the statute failed to meet the standard set by this Court in Freedman versus Maryland 380 U.S. 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.223" offset="3508224">On the Government’s appeal, this Court noted probable jurisdiction on March 2, of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.945" offset="3555140">Now I think there are three principle points to which I have to address myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.280" offset="3580531">One of them not decided by either of the courts below, but suggested I think more or less inevitably by intervening decisions which as this Court knows we have appealed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.507" offset="3637373">And that is the question extensively settled in Roth versus United States whether indeed the Congress can regulate the use of mails for the sending of obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.100" offset="3691813">The second question is whether the particular procedures, administrative procedures in this case as I mentioned this case, the Mailbox case deals only with Section 4006 and when I refer to Section 4007 any discussion of it, I think it would appropriately deferred to the Book Bin case whether the administrative procedures for determining obscenity are appropriate under this Court’s decision in Freedman versus Maryland, now with the sole grounded decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.789" offset="3814484">The third point which was a grounded decision in the Book Bin case is the issue whether the orders which maybe obtained as relief are a proper form of relief in light of this Court’s decisions and in particular decision Lamont versus the Postmaster General.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.418" offset="3889089">On the question of authority to close the mails to this kind of matter, the general authority of Congress over the mails is firmly established in as I mentioned before precisely similar circumstances except that it -- the occasion was fraud rather than obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.089" offset="3975711">This Court has upheld by a substantial margin, precisely the same form of relief, that is the Donaldson case which we discuss at some length in our brief, but it might be helpful I think to simply read one short passage from the opinion appearing at page 190 of the report which it seems to us is equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.382" offset="4108936">All the forgoing statutes and others which need not be referred to manifest a purpose of Congress to utilize its powers to protect people against fraud in that case, this Government power has always been recognized in this country and it’s firmly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.565" offset="4169644">The particular statutes here attacked have been regularly enforced by the executive officers in the Courts for more than half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.121" offset="4199842">They are now part and parcel of our governmental fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.684" offset="4214157">The same maybe said with equal strength I think of the obscenity statutes which were upheld not six years later, not this particular statute, but other statutes dealing with the government’s authority over the mails in the Roth case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.870" offset="4410807">I think there is a particular risk in that direction under Section 4007 which treats both statutes and the objections to what seems to me to run equally to the fraud statute as to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.914" offset="4470993">The Court maybe able to discern some differences between fraud and obscenity, the government does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.676" offset="4506102">Other than that, the answer to your question is certainly yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.021" offset="4547480">The interests of the Government in regulation of the mails have sometimes been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.776" offset="4578513">I realize that there is a position which now has substantial adherence in the Court that the Federal Government has somewhat less interest in regulation of these matters than perhaps the states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.203" offset="4632221">But I think it’s fair to observe that that position is always been articulated in terms of a level of obscenity rather than the question whether the regulation is not possible, whether the materials in question must be hardcore or not which might be insisted upon to the Federal Government and not for the states and not whether a particular form of regulation would or would not be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.423" offset="4757086">And I think it's incumbent on me to point out that the consequences for the Government and for the Government’s posture here are not at all abstract as the Court knows, use of the postal services which is a government enterprise is a very valuable tool for distributors through the mail and I think anytime that the Government becomes involved in this enterprise by lending this aid, there must be some appearance to the people of the country that this legitimizes in some sense, the enterprise which is taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.122" offset="4931897">And if indeed it is an illegitimate enterprise one which the Government has a right to interfere with, why then the Government cannot tolerate, indeed will not tolerate that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.645" offset="4993964">It’s not irrelevant in these circumstances that these mailers have a claim not simply to pay their own way, but to have the Government pay part of the way for them through use of second or fourth class mailing privileges.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="1356.320" offset="5528639">Any -- I think any sort of fraud that’s dealt with through the mail there’s also a section which was initially the sections sought to -- that sought to deal with obscenity simply because that was the way that the purveyors of this stuff originally conducted their business having to do with the use of false names and addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.612" offset="5621844">I might point out again and it’s the special character of the mails that even if one gave Stanley its broadest reading, it would be difficult to say that it necessarily foreclosed the type of relief which the statute embodies in that one cannot know as one can where material is sold over the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.796" offset="5714526">One cannot know whether the sale involved is indeed to an adult or consensual of the two parameters of the Stanley opinion on which a considerable weight has been placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.688" offset="5770115">But going beyond that, I think it’s sufficient to observe at this point that the Stanley opinion carefully preserved the right of state and Federal Government to proceed against commercial enterprises in this field and it is not hard to discern in that opinion which cites the First Amendment, nonetheless a considerable degree of emphasis on the Fourth Amendment and on conceded notions of privacy which are especially appropriate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.110" offset="5907832">Indeed as we suggest, it seems to us more appropriate to deal with Stanley as a case imposing a disability on the government because of the particular dangers of the situation with which the Georgia statute in that case attempted to deal than a case which recognizes any kind of right to receive on the part of the individual involved in which might therefore be used as a tool as indeed the purveyors of this material are seeking to use it for expanding the area in which they may operate free of Government interference or supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.329" offset="6076688">Turning to the Freedman question, it seems to us as we set out in our brief that this case is entirely different in the situation which confronted this Court in Freedman versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.829" offset="6146696">If I may recount that briefly, that case was concerned with movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.915" offset="6175013">The law before the Court require that anyone who wish to show a movie in Maryland before he could show it, he must submit it to a board of censors and that board would then decide whether or not he would be permitted to show it in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.251" offset="6244394">There was no particular certainty about how long that would take about that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.539" offset="6265501">There was no particular certainty about how long it might take in the Court of Appeals to have it reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.391" offset="6296952">Here entirely in contrast, these magazines were being advertised and sent through the mails for the moment, we may assume at the moment that they came off the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.996" offset="6335404">There was no governmental interference, no governmental clearance of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.261" offset="6364453">Similarly, the board which reviewed the movies in Freedman, was a board which did nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.023" offset="6407502">Here, the matter goes to a federal hearing examiner or judicial officer, someone within the administrative process to be sure about the person who as many of the insulations of which judges enjoy, who sees a broad range of problems come before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.593" offset="6473749">One of whom it certainly could not be said as the Court remarked that the board in Freedman versus Maryland that his business is to censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.641" offset="6513977">There is a necessity here that the Government go forward by filing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.736" offset="6530278">There is no burden of going forward on the part of the mailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.436" offset="6545115">There is a necessity here that the Government prove that the matter is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.120" offset="6563819">There is no burden to be carried by the person using the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.174" offset="6584090">Indeed, the only point at which the appellee is here have been able to rely on Freedman as in a singular question of appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.193" offset="6620139">It is true that the Section 4006 order goes into effect automatically and if they don’t appeal, then it will have effect on them and to that extent it can be said that the statutory scheme does not require judicial involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.661" offset="6678026">But that we submit is no different from the possibility of default which always inheres in any kind of process because every incentive under the statute is for these individuals to appeal to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.145" offset="6735914">If they do so, at the least, under the reading of Section 4006, which we consider mandatory, they will have preserved their mail for the possibility that on judicial review it will be found to have been not obscene and during that period of course they are free to go forward and to continue to solicit remittances for these magazines, remittances which they know if they succeed they will receive and if they don’t succeed, I suppose in this line of enterprise that that might even be some kind of a badge on the sleeve as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.150" offset="7039979">There are possible issues of timeliness, but as I shall discuss in the Book Bin case, I think those are amply dealt with by Court's powers to modify Section 4007 relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.401" offset="7092955">Certainly, the question has been raised whether on appeal, will the sender carry some kind of burden of showing that its material was not obscene, that the post office decided the case wrongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.175" offset="7144051">At least as long as this Court’s present practice continues, I think it must be clear to any court in this country that they may not accept the judgment which someone else may have made about whether material is obscene or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.082" offset="7203715">That they must themselves inspect and consider the material in light of the record which has been made, yes, but it’s a full record with transcript and everything else which could be hoped for and must themselves reach the conclusion that the constitution protects it or does not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.137" offset="7279888">And as long as that line of cases persists certainly then the answer is the only burden on the appellees in a case like this is the burden of filing an appeal and indeed in the interstate circuit case footnote 22 --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="1884.921" offset="7643094">If Court please, this case started when a postal inspector inspector representing himself as being over 21 years of age, ordered seven magazines which he said he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.244" offset="7692309">Thereafter, the post office started the administrative proceedings that were discussed by Mr. Strauss and had the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.311" offset="7732642">The effect of which was to keep every adult person in America who made similarly, have wanted to order these magazines from getting these magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.375" offset="7780916">It also had the effect of invading the privacy of the mail because persons who sent first class mail to appellee had their mail poked over by post office persons in the office there to see whether this was mailed that “could or should” be delivered to appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.121" offset="7867852">So that a person who may privately have wanted to obtain these magazines for his own entertainment, for his own amusement, or for his own information would have this fact known into the postal authorities whether he wanted them to know about it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.819" offset="7946637">We have here in short the kind of federal censorship which this Court has repeatedly stated was not tolerable under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.985" offset="7999300">Very interesting to me is the fact that counsel has not mentioned at all the most recent case decided by this Court, Rowan which seems to me to be dispositive of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.649" offset="8065964">Because after all in Rowan, this Court said that the householder, the free American citizen was to decide what came into his home or what did not come into his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.320" offset="8124688">So that in Rowan, the focus was on the right of the free citizen to say, I do not want this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.349" offset="8152795">This case deals with the question of the right of the free citizen to say, I do, yes I want this, and the right of the Government to say in spite of that that you cannot have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.175" offset="8204100">The question is not as the government has put it of whether the First Amendment confers complete freedom uncontrollable by Congress to use the mails for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.989" offset="8255300">We of course do recognize the binding effect of Rowan which puts a limitation on the use of the mails and not yet in effect. Congress has already implemented perhaps, without knowing yet, important portions of the Lockhart commission report on obscenity and pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.523" offset="8341504">The Congress has enacted 39 U.S.C. Section 3010 and 3011 which now makes it a criminal offense -- no, I’m sorry that’s Section 18 U.S.C. 1735 and 1737 which now makes it a criminal offense to mail to unwilling persons material dealing with sex and Section 3010 and 3011 imposes additional burdens on a mailer to make sure that a mail or a person does not mail to those persons who don’t want it and does not mail to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.518" offset="8493432">Those sections provide for the post office department to make up a list throughout America of everybody who does not want to be contaminated by sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.878" offset="8526869">If a person doesn’t want have anything to do with sex, he can put his name on the list and he won’t have any, fine, but we have that kind of protection in the law now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.256" offset="9928391">No one knows to this day what obscenity is, Mr. Justice Harlin had occasion to comment on -- in the Sam Ginsburg case that anyone looking at the opinions in the 13 years would find them self in total complete bewilderment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.888" offset="9998921">And the reason is that it seems to me that after 13 years if the rule isn’t working, there’s something wrong with the rule and what was wrong with the rule was I submit that the notion that sex speech was not speech and therefore that it was outside of the protection of the First Amendment was a false premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.395" offset="10080946">Obscenity after all is nothing but sex speech which a lot of people don’t like, that’s all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.055" offset="10107591">It’s like saying that religious speech that we don’t like is somehow outside of the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.342" offset="10132773">Now there is a great deal of additional knowledge that we have obtained since Roth came down which ties into the correctness Mr. Justice Marshall of your statement that a social value is not a correct test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.753" offset="10198392">And it’s very interesting that in the Lockhart Commission report where they spent something like $2 million and two years, the commission came to the conclusion that this material which we have all been calling obscene in fact does have social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.731" offset="10266311">That is to say that the people who have been buying the material and reading it have benefited by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.486" offset="10293269">They have learned about sex in a way that was helpful to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.610" offset="10313853">They have had their entertainment satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.547" offset="10329527">They have had their curiosity satisfied so that the whole assumption of Roth that explicitly sexual material was totally without any value, I submit is factually untrue Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.653" offset="10397968">That that’s at least what the Lockhart Commission has concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.946" offset="10435166">Now also in Stanley as I read it, is the recognition of the right to receive material, again, the right to receive material regardless of the social worth of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.775" offset="10506428">So that if a person has the right to possess it and if he has the right to receive it, then we submit that there must be the right to distribute it subject to the legitimate state interest and we grant there are legitimate federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.112" offset="10575809">Those interests are represented in part by the Rowan decision, that’s one of it, un-consenting persons, minors are out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.993" offset="11395323">And an order to even prevent the appearance of Federal censorship that the household would be given total and complete discretion to decide what could be kept from his home even if this was a CS robot Catalog, I think was one of the illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.147" offset="11475989">And instinct with that whole opinion was the other side of the coin of the household of being king of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.778" offset="11510471">That if he didn’t want anything he could keep it out and if he did want it, he had every right to have it come in to his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.732" offset="11558327">In the Rowan brief and I understand really why the Government did not side Rowan because in Rowan the Government made an awful lot of concessions that are totally inconsistent with the position that the Government is taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.924" offset="11623111">For example in its brief in Rowan, on page six at Footnote 1, the Government said “that adults who want to receive obscene material can receive it under this Bill.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.408" offset="13181053">The Lockhart Commission, after a great deal of study, came to basically the same conclusion that in a free society there is no other way to handle the problem other than by permitting, consenting adults to satisfy their curiosity and interest in matters pertaining to sex.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.920" offset="13467042">It should also be observed it seems to me that most of the free world appears to be traveling in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.470" offset="13505285">Not only Denmark has abolished its obscenity laws, Sweden, the last I heard was about to do so and I think they have by now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.604" offset="13545827">In West Germany, the Highest Court has concluded that so far as consenting adults are concerned that they should have the opportunity to receive and should be the opportunity of selling to consenting adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.539" offset="13613537">There have been studies in both Israel and Great Britain which were comparable to the Lockhart report reaching basically the same conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.434" offset="13665155">And indeed the whole area of saying that people should be able to read what they want in this area touches upon another area of the law that has a relevance and that is that consenting adults ought to be able to do what they want to do at least in the area of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.492" offset="13757315">We all know about the Model Penal Code turn to the graph number four which came out in 1954 and which basically said that what adults do privately is no legitimate concern of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.162" offset="13820008">Whatever approach we take in that regard surely by 1970, we have to agree, it would seem to me that we should be allowed to think about and dream about all of the sexual fantasies that are running through our heads anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.635" offset="13889912">There was one very interesting study in the Lockhart report that perhaps bears repeating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.694" offset="13934111">A group of persons were showing the most pornographic pictures that the researchers could get and then they were measured for the impact on the individuals both in terms of heartbeat, blood pressure, dilation of eyes and things like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.606" offset="14213831">Under the -- under this Federal Censorship Law, the Post Office Department can execute its own order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.116" offset="14243819">That is to say once the Post Office Department decides that the material is obscene then the mail is interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.448" offset="14273181">The burden is upon us to file a lawsuit if we want to do something and even up until -- even if we would file a lawsuit there is no assurance that the mail will not be sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.213" offset="14316231">When we file the lawsuit there are no time requirements within which the court will have to decide whether or not we are right or wrong and the burden of proof is placed upon us when we file the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.164" offset="14368057">The statute is also dead because it permits an administrative official, a post office judicial office who really is a censor in spite of what Government counsel says, it says censorship board when this judicial officer acts, he is acting as a censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.379" offset="14432841">He makes the determination rather than a jury and as far back is the Kingsley Book case Mr. Justice Brennan suggested that obscenity could only be properly decided by a jury because it was so linked with the question of the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.629" offset="14497938">But here we have dispensation of the jury in favor of a postal censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.252" offset="14520404">There is no requirement of sceinta at all and this Court has said even though the obscenity is especially vague law that the scienta requirement compensates in some regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.530" offset="14577455">Here we do not have the compensation of scienta because scienta is irrelevant to it so that -- and we have also what’s basically a Lamont Point because here what happens is if we think of it in terms of the householder who mails a letter to the appellee then his mail is interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.798" offset="14678601">As a matter of fact, what happens is a man will send in his money and he‘ll never get a response because the Post Office Department has impounded really the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.775" offset="14718516">Now if it’s true that under the unlawful order it can be sent back, but the way the Government handles it while litigation is pending, it’s neither sent back nor is it delivered to us so it’s held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.530" offset="14765537">Now you take this case so for about a year-and-half people have been sending in money to appellee and the Government has that money.</text>
