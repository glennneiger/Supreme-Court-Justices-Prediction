            <text syncTime="31.754" offset="230379">I believe that this Moore case will furnish to the Court more truly than is to be found elsewhere in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.213" offset="284191">Clarity and certainty and indeed the solution for the problem with which the Court is now wrestling.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.753" offset="330376">These qualities emerged if the Court please, first I think because in this case and only in this case are there individuals before the Court, pleading their constitutional right against the compulsions which have been imposed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.141" offset="419924">This Court has often recognized of course that that puts a constitutional questions in its clearest bite.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.537" offset="457540">Furthermore, if the Court please, the compulsions which have been imposed are all opposed by these Moore plaintiffs for whom I appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.022" offset="523473">They do not accept some and reject the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.264" offset="548446">They oppose all their compulsions of racial nature which have been fastened upon them below.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.695" offset="586167">By contrast as Your Honors will have noted, the plaintiffs and Swann of course and the District Court below to be sure, support all the compulsions which have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.630" offset="657847">On the other hand, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, defendant in this case, acquiesces in some of the compulsions indeed propose some of them, the Solicitor General acquiesces in such as maybe regarded as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.710" offset="742170">Pardon me, the Solicitor General more specifically in such as maybe regarded as feasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.628" offset="2813889">Now, that injunction was -- our case was removed into the federal court at that point upon valid federal grounds as we understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.525" offset="2873448">And the defendant Board of Education asked for a three-judge court to determine the constitutionality of the pronouncement of the statute which is I say was – are the very words of the injunction that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.943" offset="2943143">Before the three-judge court convened and heard the case, the District Court below set aside our injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.825" offset="2982640">The single judge stated aside, saying in expressed terms that he did so pending the rulings of the three-judge court and of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.890" offset="3026944">Now, the three-judge court heard the case and ruled that the words I have already expressed Your Honor are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.671" offset="3082010">That it -- and here came a remarkable inconsistency, an inconsistency that is deep and inherent and afflicts all who seek, I respectfully say, “Rises again and again to plague all who seek to say, “We will obey Brown, which commands operating school on a non-racial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.686" offset="3190157">We will obey Brown by the very act of operating them on a racial basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="778.061" offset="3215653">Here is the inconsistency that the Court itself expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.557" offset="3233625">It says, “It is constitutional, quite constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.104" offset="3255777">Indeed, it is the essence of Brown that you shall not exclude the child from a public school on ground of his race.”</text>
            <text syncTime="796.893" offset="3290990">But it is unconstitutional to say that he may not be assigned to a school on the basis of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.042" offset="3331532">Those two things, Your Honor, are absolutely in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.672" offset="3358072">They are inherently so.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.745" offset="3366327">Is it not obvious that if there can be no prohibition against assigning the child on basis of his race and if you do, therefore assign him on the base of his race, you are excluding him on basis of race from another school, this school to which he wishes to go or which he may have been attending and to which it is natural, geographically or otherwise that he should attend.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.615" offset="3705814">We show in this record and it is concise, these things quickly, that as far back as 1965, this school system was adjudged by the District Court, the same District Court albeit a judge, was adjudged to be operating on a non-racial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.083" offset="3799751">A basis in which there was no gerrymandering of school attendant's zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.382" offset="3828903">Geographically, they were arranged and on geographical basis children were assigned to attend and there was complete freedom of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.942" offset="3879163">And so it was adjudged non-racial and the Circuit Court upheld that.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.770" offset="3902464">And then -- now just within the past year, the same District Court, Albeit now the new judge reaffirmed many of those factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.851" offset="3954813">Adjudged for example that in no other public school system had the Board of Education achieved as much in the way of racial mixing as that no other case that had come before the appellate court had so much been achieved to that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.447" offset="4029210">That there was and is now no racial purpose, motive or element in the spending of money, in the providing facilities, faculties, schools, buildings, books, and enumerated numerous others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.808" offset="4110608">Nevertheless, Your Honors, upon that picture, there came orders of unusual severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.326" offset="4144671">These orders said, “Despite the factors just found, it is also true that in some schools there is not the mixture of the community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.301" offset="4184586">Therefore, this Court will order that the mixture of the community shall take place in every school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.488" offset="4213321">And the court went on to say, this shall be maintained, henceforth and note these words, almost revealing in its paradox, these words just as was done for decades before Brown and there is the situation Your Honors, non-racial until now they ordered to be racial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.509" offset="4341426">Now furthermore, I have already mentioned that these plaintiffs occupy a posture different from any other parties in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Litigation and that they plead their own constitutional right none others do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.339" offset="4420733">They also raise opposition on an issue which the Chief Justice concurring in North Cross said was one of the questions that needed attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.038" offset="4467545">Only these plaintiffs raised that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.529" offset="4481442">No other parties do and that issue is uncontested before this Court except and unless as we raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.902" offset="4518954">That issue is this; one of the compulsions here, they are of two essential natures, all the compulsions can be categorized under two headings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.648" offset="4562004">Number one, the gerrymandering of the school attendants zones which the school board itself proposed and which of course, all the parties other than ourselves are now accepting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.687" offset="4622085">We oppose that gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.837" offset="4630758">It is of racial nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.360" offset="4640789">The Circuit Court says it's drastic racial gerrymandering at the same moment that it upheld it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.341" offset="4680704">And now all other compulsions here come under the heading of requirement that the child go long distances to school even beyond the gerrymandered boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.736" offset="9674271">There are many cases in North Carolina where a school construction is sought to be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.782" offset="9690467">This is the decision of the Board of Education and unless there is an abuse of discretion, a school will be constructed where the board determines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.189" offset="9772178">The board was served with an injunction on the 25th of February.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.341" offset="9788688">On the 26th we removed it to federal court which was on Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.102" offset="9807809">On Monday morning we presented an order to the District Court for relief from the state court order because it was interfering with our implementation efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.285" offset="9848560">We were at that time faced with a District Court order that's directed us to desegregate April first, we have a state court order that says do nothing now and the contempt powers of the court are approximately equal, so we had to take the choice of honoring the one that had (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.828" offset="9954722">The legislature may have had in mind the affirmative duty that was first spelled out by Judge Sobeloff in Bradley against Richmond and in his concurring opinion in the Swann case when it was in the Court of Appeals in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.225" offset="10036224">You'll recall that Judge Sobeloff dissented and gave a very strong dissent in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.576" offset="10061720">In his concurring end result -- approval of our 1966 plan, he said this, “This is far from suggesting that children are to be uprooted arbitrarily and bused against their will to distant places merely to place them with children of the other race.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.680" offset="10146043">Here Judge Sobeloff was talking about the affirmative duty even before Green fully enunciated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.392" offset="10272893">I think that some of us have mislabeled the statute which is now before the Court as an anti-busing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.078" offset="10311659">In effect, it is an anti-discrimination statute which it embraces in toto, the pronouncements of this Court in Brown versus Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.553" offset="10361605">In that it says that “No child shall be compelled to attend any school on the basis of race and no child shall be excluded from any school on the basis of race.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.624" offset="10425866">We have long been labeled in North Carolina as have some of the other southern states as having dejure segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.868" offset="10470797">The problem as I see it, may it please the court, is when does one remove this label of dejure segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.698" offset="10518131">When this Court made its pronouncement in Brown, at that time as a matter of law, segregation was forever outlawed in North Carolina, dejure segregation was outlawed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.593" offset="10617710">That is correct Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.965" offset="10635264">I think there is no question but that segregation was wrong but of course, we North Carolina are simply until 1954, until this Court reversed its decision in Plessy versus Ferguson, we were doing no more than was allowed by this Court until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.765" offset="10730454">Now, I think as the Court has stated in Green, we must -- the Boards of Education have an affirmative duty to do what is necessary to come up with a plan that will realistically work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.761" offset="10806418">We contend that the only realistic plan that will work both for the north and the south and I do think that the dejure de facto distinction is legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.684" offset="10866082">I think we must recognize that whatever this Court does, this Court must consider that it will be the law of the land not only for the south but also for the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.104" offset="10919790">The only realistic approach to this is to allow that each child attend the school nearest his home which serves his grade, consistent with school capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.746" offset="10974333">Now the statute that is now before this Court provides for that very thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.856" offset="11002755">The legislature of North Carolina intended as best it could to preserve the neighborhood school concept, a concept which will work both in the north and the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.122" offset="11107871">It seems that in listening to the arguments that were made yesterday, if this Court is to adopt an approach other from the neighborhood school system of student assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.436" offset="11169102">If this Court is to adopt a reasonableness approach or a feasibility approach, we are going to have the same amount of litigation if not more litigation than we have experienced since Brown when the Court said that you must use all due deliberate speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.927" offset="11263039">At the time the North Carolina, the general assembly enacted this legislation which was in July of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.490" offset="11301282">There were two prominent cases that had been decided by the Supreme Court that it had to go by, that is Brown and Green and also the general assembly was guided by Sections 401 and 407 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which we think this statute embraces as it does embrace Brown and Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.792" offset="11422490">Now in Green as this Court suggested, of course that was a rather simplistic fact situation there where you had only two schools involved and the Court's suggestion as I recall in Footnote 6 that the easiest way to eliminate the dual school system there, was to draw a line down the middle of the county and all of the children in the eastern end of the county would attend the New Kent School and all of the children in the western end of the county would attend the Watkin School.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.879" offset="11562924">Now this we say was not necessarily a pronouncement but certainly a suggestion by this Court that a child be assigned or be allowed to attend not on the basis of race, but be allowed to attend a school nearest his home and we say that this is exactly what the statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.156" offset="11659995">The statute does not allow any assignments as this Court prohibited on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.789" offset="11694477">All the children are allowed to go to the school nearest their home and we think this is the only reasonable way that this Court can approach the problem now before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.524" offset="12129468">Third, I hope to discuss briefly the meaning of the statutory provisions and the various interpretations the parties have given of it and fourth, the main point why we think the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4945.199" offset="19884178">It's because this statute would also invalidate the HEW plan because the plan for Charlotte developed by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare embraces the school boards gerrymandered zones and goes further with them, it combines them into groups of schools, so that if the Solicitor General has not made the argument that Mr. Waggoner made for the school board that is on plan as unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="6799.958" offset="27303163">To -- just merely to state two additional arguments which are made in our brief and in the process I think add to my answer to the Chief Justice's question which suppose that this statute was adopted in an entirely neutral atmosphere, perhaps hundreds of years ago outside any context of -- a history of segregation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.421" offset="27425102">The first of the two arguments is the one we set out in our brief in which the court below relied on based on the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.794" offset="27454568">Now that argument of course would not apply to this hypothetical statute adopted in another environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.453" offset="27489155">The second argument I will make based on the principle decided in Hunter against Erickson and the lucid opinion by Judge Paul Hays last week involving the New York statute might apply in that other situation and I'm talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.952" offset="27563133">And I'd like to conclude by returning to what we mean by racially identifiable school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.731" offset="27602317">Now, the supremacy clause issue is I think quite simple and quite fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.468" offset="27637217">It is that the statute constitutes a practical interference with the remedial powers of the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.113" offset="27687790">Even if we accept Mr. Waggoner's interpretation of what the statute means, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.081" offset="27711718">Mr. Waggoner says that the statute only applies after you have a unitary system and then when you do, you can no longer use race.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.172" offset="27760097">And that the statute forbids -- thus prohibits the school board from using race to go beyond the requirements of Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6924.098" offset="27799803">You can go up to the requirements of Brown but not beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.889" offset="27810879">And practically what does that do?</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.515" offset="27817462">What did it do in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.639" offset="27825925">It put the school board in the position of having a federal judge who would enjoin them to come up to the requirements of Brown do the minimum -- to do at least the minimum necessary to comply with Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.361" offset="27884857">And a state judge who would enjoin them and that you can't take a one step beyond it, that you can't go one inch beyond the minimum federal constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.484" offset="27929266">Now, the statute is overbroad in general and vague as this is -- which sets up that kind of collision between the federal power and the state judge's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.354" offset="27976808">It is a practical interference with the remedial files of the federal courts as the courts below erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="6977.185" offset="28012126">And the same thing was found in an Alabama case, involved -- which we have requited in the rear at page 29A of the brief of the appellees, a 1970 Alabama statute which the three-judge court in Alabama with Judges Guin, Thomas and Piedmont (ph) held unconstitutional on the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.896" offset="28102928">It said, the legislature was trying to overturn the decisions of the federal court and under the supremacy -- on constitutional manner were -- they were trying to review the federal courts decisions about constitutional right in this case called Alabama against the United States and that the law was unconstitutional under the supremacy clause as well as under the Green case and the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7032.044" offset="28231555">Now, -- so that -- but I don't think by making that argument on Mr. Waggoner's assumption that the statute is just neutral, I don't mean to suggest for a moment that we accept that interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.724" offset="28342314">The real meaning is the one that the Attorney General of North Carolina urged in the court below and that the three-judge court accepted and that the statute was intended to prohibit school boards from using this ordinary techniques of school administration such as busing, pairing, clustering and rezoning any of them if the purpose was to affect any ration on the basis of race, any kind of racial grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="7095.179" offset="28484106">Well, the words of the statute that the second clause of the first sentence we were talking and this-- North Carolina's statute is what I refer to Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="7106.852" offset="28530813">It's at page 21 of our brief and its that, no student shall be assigned or compelled to attend any school on account of race, creed, color and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.710" offset="28582222">That was the clause we talked about and it says or for the purpose of creating a balance or ration of race, religion or national origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.571" offset="28621615">That was understood, this is what the Attorney General and the court below accepted as embodying this limitation on the power of the court to reorganize the system and this is what its involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7147.131" offset="28691937">Now, the Hunter against Erickson point, I do not intend to argue at any length but merely to state the -- and the point is simply this, that the statute does make an expressly racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="7167.978" offset="28775320">It says to a school board, you cannot for example bus children in order to racially balance the schools but you can bused them for any other purpose, you can bus children to segregate them by sex, you can bus them to any distance, to any age for any other reasons the school board might want to use it if the -- to save money to build the schools out, this is realistic, to build the schools out where the land is cheap or any of this kind of reason you can bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.701" offset="28890154">The only reason you can't use is busing for a -- for racial balance and in Judge Hays' opinion, doesn't presuppose any duty to integrate that its merely -- even if -- as he assume, there was no duty to racially balance as a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.569" offset="28981687">There were the list, that the statute disables the school board from doing something that the black community is interested in getting, namely advancing the cause of racial integration in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7235.650" offset="29045948">Now, finally, our definition of the school boards duty under the constitution does not rest on a notion that racial balance is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="7255.760" offset="29126405">We state them -- our view of the rule that the court order adopt very precisely in our brief in the Mobile which -- as the Solicitor General pointed out, we've adopted it in the Swann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7271.106" offset="29187845">It is that every black child is to be free from assignment to a black school in an identifiable racial minority school that every grade of his education and we define identifiable racial minority schools, not in terms of mathematics or percentages or any precise notion of a balance but in this terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="7300.672" offset="29306023">The racially identifiable black schools are those which by reason of a very considerable disproportion or a very considerable racial concentration are conceived as designed to received black children.</text>
            <text syncTime="7316.486" offset="29369344">The schools that are set aside for the black children, is what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7322.311" offset="29392645">And it does -- the definition doesn't rest on anything like a mathematical precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.844" offset="29418768">We recognize that a range of results or ratios which satisfy the definition of a school not identified racially.</text>
            <text syncTime="7337.471" offset="29453249">The definition embodies both the concept of disproportion which everybody is familiar in the debate and also the concept of a considerable racial concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.056" offset="29507584">On the idea of concentration refers to -- at where, even though a race is a very small part, they're all clustered in one school or in a particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="7364.607" offset="29561814">But the test depends in the final analysis and you can't get away form -- from it not on application of a mathematical rule but on the court's exercising judgment about whether the school in all the circumstances is one which is conceived as designed for black children as the separate segregated school set up as the institution, the principle institution of the segregated system, the principle vestige of the segregated system.</text>

            <text syncTime="7431.509" offset="29829413">I would like to address my observations at this time if I may Your Honors to what seems to me to have emerged as the main focus of contention, that is this matter of remedy, remedial action to cure or correct or undo or dismantle a situation caused by, let us assume for the moment, caused by wrongful governmental action in the past or indeed wrongful governmental action presently existing, and may I take as my point of departure the question that the Chief Justice asked Mr. Nabrit earlier to this effect, whether he was arguing under Mr. Justice Black's questioning about the constitutionality of this statute on its terms, the Chief Justice put the question to Mr. Nabrit, are you contending that that wording is unconstitutional in its self or are you contending that it won't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7513.364" offset="30156779">It is invalid, its unconstitutional in its application to this factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7522.716" offset="30194186">And I understood Mr. Nabrit reply, it's the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.948" offset="30215189">Now, I make bold to take the position, -- disposition Your Honors, I cannot conceive of any situation no matter what the presence of governmental action in the past or in the present may be in which any remedy can be utilized to redress a past constitutional wrong by imposing a new constitutional wrong upon anybody who objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="7567.155" offset="30372028">Now, I understand upon that and I think that is constitutional gospel.</text>
            <text syncTime="7575.178" offset="30404106">But let me develop that just a little more if I may, I say that on the question of determining whether or not there is or has been governmental action that is causing, producing a situation of compelled segregation, that is the true issue to be litigated in this respect if it can be found and this is essentially what are argued earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="7619.397" offset="30581008">If it can be found through a careful litigation in any case, that freedom is not being truly accorded now to the child, then whatever it takes to remove that governmental action, that is denying that child that true freedom today, that true free- by a true freedom I mean, freedom to go to school on non-racial basis, without regard to his color, without consideration of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="7655.089" offset="30723741">If that freedom is not being truly accorded to him, then that's what the litigation should be about in each in every case as it arises and they will of course arise still no matter what the decision here is.</text>
            <text syncTime="7671.824" offset="30790719">But that should be the inquiry and the result should be sternly to root that out as has been said by this Court, root and branch, extirpated, that freedom genuinely must be accorded but Your Honors, it is not the course to take to say to him, we will now put you back on the road of racial compulsion rather see that he gets freedom, individual freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="7710.858" offset="30946826">Now, let me give an illustration to indicate further what I am speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="7720.553" offset="30985592">Shall it be said to a Negro child for example today in a given school, the Negro child, let us say is attending a school that is convenient to his home and that's -- he prefers to go there, his parents prefer him to go there, they say so, they say so in the Moore case, this is where he wants to attend, shall school authorities be allowed to go to that child and say, because your parents were by law or governmental action forced to go here, now therefore, you are going to be forced to leave here for that because of that racial compulsion that was imposed upon them, we now will impose a racial compulsion upon you to go somewhere else that though you do not wish to go and it is only because of your race that we now take you and move you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7788.445" offset="31257161">Or to the white child, shall governmental authority say to him today, because your parents attended this school, let us say in the past, in the neighborhood of your home, and at that time, Negro children were not allowed to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7811.120" offset="31347858">By law, they weren't, therefore, you, the white child, must now leave here and go to another school you do not wish to attend and we send you away from here because you are white.</text>
            <text syncTime="7827.114" offset="31411806">There must be a retribution effective here for what was, or let us bring it to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="7839.327" offset="31460707">If it be not another of retribution for the past but here is a condition of separateness existing today, we must correct the separateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="7853.302" offset="31516609">Therefore, we must force you against your will and we will pick you by your color and sends you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7861.694" offset="31550151">Now this -- it must be starkly called what it is, it is government compelling people, driving people on basis of race.</text>

            <text syncTime="7913.345" offset="31756727">So we are going to pair some schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7915.514" offset="31765400">We're going to make sure that all through -- all the grades education is furnished to blacks and whites together rather than separately.</text>
