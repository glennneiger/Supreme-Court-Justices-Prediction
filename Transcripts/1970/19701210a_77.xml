            <text syncTime="13.686" offset="158072">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.029" offset="171447">The question on the merits of this case is the validity of the Selective Service Regulation that says that a registrant may not be represented by a lawyer when he has his personal appearance before his Local Draft Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.592" offset="225782">The appellee, Weller, was classified I-A after such a personal appearance or rather his I-A classification was retained, going to the procedures after a bit, after such a personal appearance, but he refused to submit to induction when he was ordered to report by the Board and, accordingly, he was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.348" offset="308746">The District Court dismissed the indictment before trial based on a motion filed, actually before there was a plea to the indictment, on the ground that Weller's lack of counsel at the personal appearance invalidated the order to report and, the United States has appealed from that order, dismissing the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.961" offset="387218">But before the Court might reach the merits, there is a threshold question of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.395" offset="416998">There's no doubt that the government can appeal this dismissal order of the District Court to some Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.181" offset="444061">The question is, and it's a difficult one under the Criminal Appeals Act, whether the appeal should be to this Court or to the Court of Appeals initially.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="186.150" offset="848018">It should be “remanded” is the word, but if you -- of course we filed, in lieu of a jurisdictional statement, we filed something called a motion to remand, and the Court has deferred the issue of jurisdiction until this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.990" offset="911339">So, I would like to speak for a few minutes at the outset about the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.922" offset="935058">As I indicated, this case comes up on the grant of the motion -- of a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment under Rule 12 of the Criminal Rules of Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.440" offset="977168">The motion to dismiss was originally based on two grounds. First, a claim that Weller's I-A classification was improper because there was no basis in fact for denial of his conscientious objector claim and second, the motion asserted the claim which is what is before the -- more specifically, before the Court now that the order of the Court was invalid because Weller was, in several respects denied due process at his personal appearance before the Board, principally in that he was not allowed to be represent by counsel, and that was the only issue that has survived as a live issue to this point, but he also contended initially in his motion that the Local Board had improperly denied his request to have witnesses with him and to have a Court reporter transcribe the proceedings of the personal appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.307" offset="1216554">There was no hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment, and the District Court granted the motion on the basis of the indictment itself and Weller's selective service file which, of course, was undisputed as to its contents which had been attached as an exhibit to the motion to dismiss that he filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.165" offset="1291995">The file -- the selective service file showed on its face that, while his lawyer had written letters to the Draft Board asking that he be allowed to appear with Weller and for the other procedures that I've mentioned and that the Local Board had denied them in reliance on the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.466" offset="1365243">The District Court concluded in a written opinion that the Selective Service Regulation in question here, the one that provides that no registrant may be represented before the Local Board by anyone acting as attorney or legal counsel was an invalid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.500" offset="1445386">It did not directly hold that the regulation was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.244" offset="1468374">Instead, it followed the route that this Court followed in the Greene and McElroy case, some-11 years ago, relating to rights of confrontation in Defense Department security clearance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.689" offset="1530128">The District Court considered that the denial of counsel before the Local Draft Board on the personal appearance, was a matter of doubtful constitutionality, and therefore, it considered that the regulation could not be valid unless there was express congressional authority for its promulgation by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.421" offset="1625004">And, the District Court found, despite the circumstances that I will discuss when I reach the merits as I will, the District Court decided that the general statutory grant of authority for the President to establish selective service procedures did not clearly enough authorize him to promulgate a regulation that excluded representation by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.858" offset="1726777">As I indicated, it's plain that this dismissal order is appealable somewhere since it came before the trial and was done as a matter of law on the basis of a procedural defect that was apparent on the face of the selective service record.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.726" offset="1794278">So, the only question under the Criminal Appeals Act is whether the judgment was one “based on the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded” or in the alternative, whether it was a “decision or judgment sustaining a motion at Bar.”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.060" offset="1875571">If it was either of those, then the appeal would be directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.984" offset="1895320">We say, however, that it was neither so that the appeal should be in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under that part of the statute which gives the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction over “any decision or judgment dismissing any indictment, except where a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is provided by this Section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="469.505" offset="1981419">Of course, this --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="470.547" offset="1985599">Mr. Springer, what is the reason for your deep concern about this?</text>
            <text syncTime="475.435" offset="2005138">If it went to the Ninth Circuit, would it be here anyway in due course?</text>

            <text syncTime="479.055" offset="2019558">Well, it would be here, Mr. Justice Blackmun, only on a petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.289" offset="2044531">Our concern is more -- rather, than a narrow concern with this particular litigation is with the Administration of Justice, I think it's fair to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.745" offset="2102314">Assuming that we do not have a new legislation, there are serious questions which are, if nothing else, very difficult ones for the government in deciding where to proceed, and we think it's appropriate to make the point here and also, we believe strongly in the general principles of this underlying much of this Court's jurisdiction that cases should be considered in the Courts of Appeals before they come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.739" offset="2218297">And, I think that general consideration is reflected in the principle that underlies the majority view in the Sisson case last term, as well as a number of other -- of this Court's cases under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.301" offset="2276603">That that Act --</text>

            <text syncTime="601.891" offset="2510973">Of course, we raised this at the first stage at which we filed any papers in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.669" offset="2538036">We had a dilemma, frankly as we frequently have under this Act, in knowing where to go first.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.879" offset="2574921">I think the principle -- the basic principle in which this question ought to be considered is the principle, as I indicated, as the Court has recognized on a number of occasions that the Criminal Appeals Act is a technical statute that historically arose from a clear congressional compromise rather than from a single coherent all-embracing legislative purpose and, therefore, that it should be read narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.615" offset="2685785">And, I think that principle is especially apt in this situation where the issue is not whether there is an appeal or not, but simply where it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.921" offset="2727058">So, in a sense, the practical issue is an issue of the management of appellate business rather than deciding whether or not a litigant, that is the government, has a right to appeal or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.260" offset="2780453">So, in that sense, I think the -- it might be said that less is at stake than, for example, in the Sisson case where it was an issue of whether or not there would be any appeal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.242" offset="2824338">In light of that, we think it's fair to say that the burden of argumentative persuasion should be on those who say that the appeal should come directly to this Court, short-circuiting the more conventional initial review in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.067" offset="2899675">In this respect, it is somewhat like the principles that have under -- that underlie some of the Court's decisions in the three-judge Court area in civil cases where there's a similar principle of narrow reading of a technical statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.501" offset="2965400">Let me then turn to the two statutory issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.619" offset="2985880">First, the question whether the dismissal of Weller's indictment on the ground that a procedural regulation followed by the Local Draft Board was insufficiently authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.582" offset="3061739">The appellee says that that is -- that decision amounted to a construction of the statute on which the indictment is based, that is, the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.620" offset="3101863">The short answer to that is that the dismissal was based on the regulation, not on the Act, and the Court held the regulation to be invalid under a principle of, I guess you'd call it, general law that regulations impairing procedural rights are invalid unless Congress has specifically authorized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.599" offset="3205726">The only reference to the statute, therefore, was a negative one and we do not think that a determination that an Act does not say something on a subject has to be treated as a “construction” of the statute under this technical Act which, as we say, should be read narrowly.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="1180.001" offset="4823333">It would -- well, I think it would because I understand the Bill would quite clearly resolve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.914" offset="4847052">In fact, there -- I have had some indications the Bill may eventually come out with a provision only for appeal to the Court of Appeals, reserving this Court before certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.653" offset="4881951">In any event, I think it's clear that the Bill, if it's accepted in anything like the form in which it has been so far, would not allow direct appeal in any case that does not involve the validity of the underlying statute, so that we wouldn't have this construction of statute issue or the motion at Bar issue I think, clearly, as I understand the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.000" offset="4975365">The point, I think, on this notion of a motion at Bar as something raising new matter that would prevent a conviction even if the defendant has committed the acts of which he's charged is that the defense that Weller has raised here is not that kind of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.570" offset="5049657">His defense raised in his motion is that there was no offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.943" offset="5071182">He's not confessing the events and saying there's some external reason why I can't be convicted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.888" offset="5090931">He says there is no offense because implicit in the indictment is an allegation that the order to report for induction was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.534" offset="5125517">He claims that this order -- excuse me, the order to report was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.841" offset="5142758">He claims that the order to report was invalid because of the procedural defect and hence that he committed no crime when he failed to take his step forward at the induction station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.696" offset="5186121">So, we think that his motion presented a purely legal defense based on the face of the record and that, under the common law principles of a special plea at Bar or a motion at Bar, that does not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.178" offset="5256129">So, for that reason, we think that the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals and that this Court did not reach the merits, but since the Court might disagree with that, I will now proceed to the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.762" offset="5350379">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.426" offset="5361037">As I indicated, the question on the merits quite simply, in the terms of the District Court's opinion, is whether the President had authority from Congress to promulgate the selective service regulation which has been in force, I might say, in -- since 1940, that is, throughout the entire modern history of selective service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.331" offset="5452675">Whether he had authority to adopt that regulation which reads no registrant may be represented at his personal appearance before the Local Board by anyone acting as attorney or legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.050" offset="5507532">And, we do not deny that if the District Court was right in holding that regulation invalid, that the indictment should in fact have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.332" offset="5548701">So, the question is the validity of that regulation on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.667" offset="5570017">Before I go on to discuss the arguments made by the District Court and by the appellee, I think it would be helpful to put the question in context by describing the role that the personal appearance has in the Selective Service classification process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.881" offset="5638875">That process begins, of course, when a young man registers with his Local Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.057" offset="5659564">Subsequently, the Board sends him a classification questionnaire which he fills out and which then goes into a selective service file bearing his name, together with any other written information of any kind that the registrant or anyone else on his behalf chooses to provide to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.721" offset="5738245">In the case of someone who, like Weller, claims to be a conscientious objector, this includes the Form 150, the special CO Form and it can include, under the regulations, any other written request for a particular classification or any documents, affidavits, or depositions subject only to the condition that they are as concise and as brief as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.609" offset="5829778">There's nothing to stop a registrant from filing complete legal brief with his Board on his classification if he chooses to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.612" offset="5869798">Then, when the time comes, the Board classifies each registrant at a formal meeting and the regulations provide, and I think this is important, quite explicitly that the classification must be done on the basis of the entire file and nothing other than written material that appears in that file and of course, the registrant or anyone he authorizes has the right to inspect that file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.123" offset="5971884">Then, after the Board makes its initial classification decision, it sends a notice of classification to the registrant and then, for the first time, he has a right to the personal appearance that we are talking about, before the Board or a member or members designated for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.951" offset="6051192">In order to have such interview, he has to request it in writing 30 days -- within 30 days after the notice of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.251" offset="6084420">The nature of the personal appearance is described in this language from the selective service regulations which appear on page 60 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.664" offset="6129977">The regulation says at any such appearance, the registrant may discuss his classification, may point out the class or classes in which he thinks he should have been placed, and may direct attention to any information in his file which he believes the Local Board has overlooked or to which he believes it is not given sufficient weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.277" offset="6196433">The registrant may present such further information as he believes will assist the Local Board in determining his proper classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.985" offset="6223287">Such information shall be in writing or, if oral, shall be summarized in writing by the registrant and, in either event, shall be placed in the registrant's file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.318" offset="6264665">The Section before that, of course, prohibits counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.623" offset="6277831">That's the specific regulation we're concerned with, and that regulation also provides that no person other than a registrant shall have the right to appear in person before the Local Board, but the Local Board may, in its discretion, permit any person to appear before, with or in behalf of a registrant and then there's a provision that if he doesn't speak English, he can have an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.992" offset="6355362">Typically, there is not a stenographic transcript of the discussion at the personal appearance, but the Board may prepare a summary as the Board, itself, or one of the members of the Board did hear and put it in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.396" offset="6404995">And, as I indicated, the registrant is directed by the regulation to prepare his own summary so that there would be that record in the file of what went on, and this ties in again with the regulation that the Board can classify only on the basis of written materials appearing in the file.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.595" offset="8653720">In this 1965 legislation I refer to, relating to general rights of counsel before administrative agencies, the House report on that Bill noted specifically that, under regulations prescribed by the President, a registrant may not be represented before a Local Draft Board by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.267" offset="8724459">This is because of the large number of registrants involved, the informality of procedures, and the need for capacity to provide large numbers of men quickly for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.555" offset="8773569">And, again in connection with the 1967 draft legislation, there's a certain amount of congressional discussion about the reasons for rejecting the proposals then that there should be lawyers, again suggesting that it's inconsistent with the basic duty of the selective services to which, of course, this Court has recognized on numerous occasions and recognized, for example Clark against Gabriel in the context of pre-induction judicial review, that the purpose of the selective service system is to raise large numbers of men without litigious interruptions which Congress has, I think, reasonably believed would impair that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.803" offset="8970533">There's some further suggestion in the legislative history of 1967 another congressional feeling which again, I think is reasonable, that the more formalize these proceedings become, the greater advantage is given to those who, for one reason or another, are in a better position to take advantage of formalized proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.912" offset="9471039">It would rather substantially change the setup, I think, if you started to make these adversary proceedings by having lawyers coming in performing the kind of job that a lawyer ordinarily does, and Congress has made the express decision that it did not want to have that happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.534" offset="9541465">And, as articulated, I think a reasonable basis for so deciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.718" offset="9570200">Of course, the appellee relies quite heavily on this Court's decision last term in the Goldberg and Kelley case on procedural rights with respect to welfare terminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.659" offset="9641984">I think, as with all of these matters, you can't proceed by a process of deductive reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.725" offset="9670301">You can't say that, as he does, the personal appearance is obviously an important matter for the draft registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.413" offset="9701021">It's a matter in which his personal rights are determined, therefore, it is an adjudicative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.482" offset="9725262">In every adjudicative hearing, you must have a lawyer because the Court said so in Goldberg against Kelley, therefore, there must be a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.815" offset="9750653">And, if the whole premise of the Goldberg versus Kelley decision is that you balance each situation, the result there was a relatively limited kind of hearing, where to be sure, the Court did say a lawyer should be present, but I think the draft situation can't be deduced from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.816" offset="9826617">I think it's a matter of making the same kind of balancing process in the draft context, which is something that Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.186" offset="9852113">For the reasons that I've indicated, I think that cannot said to be so in consistent with -- so in reasonable or so consistent with principles of fundamental fairness that it should be held to be a violation of the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.688" offset="10062137">Presumably, the Boards can rely on the Ninth Circuit rather than on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.518" offset="10093484">I think, in this context, it's I think, perhaps the appellee overestimates, and it's easy to overestimate the range of the decision making discretion that a Local Board has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.290" offset="10156492">In this regard, there have been a number of quite significant changes in the recent years and, in fact, recent months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.624" offset="10181883">For example, this Court's Newton Act decision last term took away from the Boards the entire power that they had previously to reclassify people whom they found to be delinquents, which was obviously an area with considerable discretion which the Court felt that the Boards hadn't been given, so that area is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.590" offset="10265684">As of last spring, occupational deferments were discontinued, so the questions of what's an essential occupation and what is not are not now matters that the Boards have to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.688" offset="10350111">In last summer, in the conscientious objective area which we are dealing with here, following the decision in Welsh, specifically last term, the national director of selective service put out a two-page statement of the considerations that a Board should take into account in determining whether a man is a conscientious objector which, I think, boils down – there's -- I think they are quite comparable to the kind of instructions that a trial judge might give to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.020" offset="10459408">So, the Board is focused, and it's focused principally on the sincerity issue in the conscientious objective area -- conscientious objector area and a question which I think has to be answered necessarily in terms of what the registrant says out of his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.469" offset="10545298">I think it's not a matter of confronting adverse witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.775" offset="10562435">It's not a matter of dealing with self-incrimination problems or forfeiting rights, and there's nobody there arguing against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.592" offset="10969736">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.994" offset="11011323">This is the third selective service case which the Supreme Court is hearing this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.116" offset="11035878">Unlike Gillette and Negre, which were argued yesterday however, this case does not involve cosmic questions of the definition of a man's conscience, of the nature of his religious beliefs the character of conscientious objection, the relationship between total objection and selective objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.062" offset="11107662">It involves, rather, the more mundane, but no less you pick with this question of fairness in the operation of the selective service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.685" offset="11142144">The administrative agency which determines which man shall be drafted and which man shall not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.851" offset="11170774">Last term, this Court was deeply divided in a case which raised the question of the proper definition of conscientious objection and the relationship between the religious and the non-religious objector, I'm referring, of course, to the Welsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.928" offset="11227094">But this Court was unanimous in its declaration in the Malloy case that full and fair administrative review is indispensible to the fair operation of the selective service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.369" offset="11280802">I respectfully submit that that the backdrop in the Malloy case, as is likewise the backdrop in this case, is the extremely limited judicial review of selective service administrative decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.443" offset="11341093">This is a standard of judicial review which this Court has declared since the Estep case in 1946 and continues to reiterate whenever there is a selective case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.665" offset="11389994">That the decisions of the Local Boards and the Appeal Boards of the selective service system must be approved by the Courts even if they are erroneous decisions so long as they are not without a basis in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.147" offset="11460002">I submit that the essence of this case is the emergence of the doctrine that the selective service system is to be treated like any other administrative agency which adjudicates personal and property rights and that it can operate fairly unless only if the person affected has the right to a meaningful hearing before action is taken which affects him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.442" offset="11569089">And, that under a parade of decisions of this Court and of other Courts, there is no meaningful hearing unless the person who was subjected to these sanctions by an administrative agency, who was subjected to these deprivations and effects upon his personal and property rights, has the right to the advice, the assistance, and the presence of counsel at the scene of such hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.583" offset="11665742">This is the essence of the decision of Judge Peckham below, and I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General when the Solicitor General states that Judge Peckham's decision in the Northern District of California was based only on the question of whether or not the regulation was authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.077" offset="11747662">The same words which Judge Peckham uses to declare the denial of counsel, that is the regulation prohibiting the appearance of counsel as not being authorized by Congress, is likewise the same words which Judge Peckham uses in concluding that the prohibition of counsel is without constitutional sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.163" offset="11836061">I may say finally, in terms of the setting of this case, that this case also involves, I respectfully submit, the exorcising of a myth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.426" offset="11885066">The myth that selective service Local Boards are not administrative tribunals like hundreds or thousands of other administrative tribunals around the country, federal and state, but some kind of informal (Inaudible) after-church discussion groups, colloquially called little groups of neighbors and that, therefore, they should not be held to the same standards as other agencies which affect personal and property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.136" offset="11995930">This myth, I submit, was always based on a fiction, but the myth has now been officially disembodied by a change in the regulations mentioned in our brief, which I will get to later in my argument, and the time has long come to be finally exorcised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.413" offset="12061027">If I may touch upon the jurisdictional question; frankly, the first point which I was going to make was that which I believe came out in colloquy between Mr. Justice Brennan and my learned adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.575" offset="12133648">The Ninth Circuit has quite clearly indicated that it disagrees with the position of Judge Peckham.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.210" offset="12368227">While, of course, I don't deny for one minute that the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General's Office are as interested in the Administration of Justice as those of us in the Defense Bar, the fact is that one cannot overlook the fact that might -- that any experienced lawyer would recognize the inevitability of the Ninth Circuit overruling Judge Peckham and I could not believe that the government was unaware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.191" offset="12460178">If the question is asked as to why this case was brought to the Supreme Court in the first place, I would refer the Court to appendix C to the government's brief which is a letter written by the distinguished former director of the selective service system, General Louise B. Hershey, addressed to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.943" offset="12531127">This is reprinted at pages 74 and 75 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.038" offset="12547532">General Hershey takes the view “the effect of this decision, if allowed to stand unchallenged, would be to place an intolerable burden upon the administration of the selective service system in the Northern District of California, and if extended to other jurisdictions would result in constructive paralysis of the selective service system in the performance of its mission of procurement of manpower for the Department of Defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.294" offset="12632586">Then, it cites various decisions, including the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.007" offset="12643349">And then states the Congress of the United States in enacting and re-enacting the selective service laws during the past 29 years have been well-aware of those provisions of the selective service regulations which discourage the presence of legal counsel for registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.993" offset="12695385">Then finally, “I am, therefore, making this formal request on you under the authority given to me in the statute to proceed as expeditiously as possible and asking for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.593" offset="12737703">Now may it please the Court, as I read all of the opinions in the Sisson case and in the Mersky case and in the Blue case and in all of the other cases, and grapple with the same problems that the Solicitor General's Office grapples with, one thing I think comes clear, and that is that it was the -- it is the philosophy of the Criminal Appeals Act that where there are truly vital important constitutional questions in criminal cases, that the path should be smooth for their being resolved by the Supreme Court immediately and without the intermediate step of the Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.040" offset="14011538">Of course, under the view of motion in Bar which was taken by Mr. Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion in the Mersky case, we should confine the medieval pleading notions to the dusty bookshelves, if I recall the adjectives correctly, and that a motion in Bar exists where there is a termination of the cause and an exculpation of the defendant and, of course, that clearly occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3926.142" offset="15807927">I was going to say, indeed, that to suit its purposes on the congressional authorization point, the government tries to couple or link the statute in the regulation as closely together as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.155" offset="15864038">Indeed, it tries to fuse them together with the best welding material which it has, but for purpose of meeting its jurisdictional argument, the government tries to separate them, and this leads to a little bit of schizophrenia in the government's brief because they refer -- at one place, they refer to the statute and regulation combined as the law of selective service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.868" offset="15950869">It obviously suits their purpose to argue that this is the law of selective service on the merits while it doesn't suit their purpose to do so on the jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.036" offset="15987545">I think, though, that the final point on jurisdiction has to do with the government's concession, as it must concede that there was direct jurisdiction in this Court on statutory construction of the Eisdorfer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.223" offset="16040312">The government argues that there are some differences between Eisdorfer in this case because Eisdorfer involved the delinquency regulations, while this case involves a regulation prohibiting counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.124" offset="16083884">Well, I -- the government says that there is this difference, but doesn't say why this makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.922" offset="16103111">It argues that one is more remote than another, but I submit that the delinquency regulations, as anyone who has read the Oestereich and Gutknecht and Breen decisions of this Court knows, involves procedure perhaps even more so than it involves substance and the regulation involved in this case is obviously also a procedural regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4028.544" offset="16217527">I'm pointing out the government is trying to explain the logic in its position and I believe they have a lot of explaining to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.942" offset="16251173">If I may move now to the point on the merits; we start with the proposition announced by this Court in Greene against McElroy, and foreshadowed in previous decisions and followed in later decisions that since only Congress can draft, only Congress can deny the right of counsel as part of the drafting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.306" offset="16388577">It seems that this is self-evident and the government almost admits it, except for one place, page 22 of its brief where it seems to suggest that may be this is not so and that may be there are no limits on presidential power to deny counsel or to otherwise structure the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.413" offset="16473004">And, the implication perhaps is that maybe there are not even any limits on other presidential war powers, a point which the government tantalizingly suggests and doesn't move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.888" offset="16510934">And then, once again, it talks about non-jud -- non-justiciability and to my surprise, the case which it cited is an order of this Court denying certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.305" offset="16552626">And, of course, I was taught from my first breath of constitutional law that one should never see a denial of a petition for certiorari as having any kind of significance on the merits, but perhaps when -- perhaps that's the best thing that the government could cite for this preposition, so they cited it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4133.796" offset="16638516">I'm referring, Mr. Justice White, to the government's -- the footnote on page 22 of the government's brief where Moore against McNamara, an order of this Court denying certiorari, is presumably cited in favor of the proposition that what the government regards as non-justiciable controversies of a political nature should not properly be brought before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.179" offset="16740080">The -- it seems that, as we read the Greene case, the requirement of explicit authorization before there may be a tampering with fundamental constitutional rights, is so clear that it is hard to see what the government is belaboring except that one must identify what appears to be a complete nimble effort on the part of the government to read the Greene case to stand for its opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.417" offset="16853034">The government seems to read the Greene case as saying that purposeful inaction means the same thing as action, but it seems quite clear to me, from anyone who reads it, that the Greene Case specifically said that mere acquiescence or inaction is sufficient -- is insufficient, that Congress must specifically authorize a departure from a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.284" offset="16948537">Now, the government mentions Hannah against Larche, which was of course the decision where this Court split 5-4 on the amount of due process which was available to witnesses before the Civil Rights Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.358" offset="16992841">Now, it seems to me that the decision in Hannah against Larche is completely different from that which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.906" offset="17014993">In Hannah against Larche, there was indeed -- there were indeed two proposals before Congress, two complete proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.446" offset="17045191">One which provided for a greater measure of due process and another which provide for a lesser measure of due process and both, interestingly, provided for rights of counsel, though to different extents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.943" offset="17083120">And, the legislative history of Hannah against Larche is clearly revealed by the majority decision of this Court, so that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Commission indicated that Congress explicitly selected one of these schemes and specifically rejected the other scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.064" offset="17159607">The argument of congressional acquiescence, was not followed in this Court in Greene, not followed in this Court in 2C, a selective service matter though not involving Selective Service Administration last year -- last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.144" offset="17203911">The government finally argues about the legislative history of the 1967 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.696" offset="17222196">It appears to us as we read the same legislative history that it means a great deal other than what the government says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.470" offset="17245288">Of course, there were extensive hearings, but as we recall and as the Court may well take judicial notice, these hearings were essentially about student defermance, about the lottery, about occupational defermance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.522" offset="17285413">Very little attention was given to selective service procedures, very little attention was given to conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.090" offset="17311744">The government argues -- points to the testimony given by General Hershey in an interim report which was prepared, but as we point out in our brief, the House Armed Services Committee expressly disclaimed that it was any reflection of General Hershey's views, as indeed it might for General Hershey distinguished himself at these hearings by making the statement that he was opposed to any amendments to the law because “you can do almost anything under this law which is more than you can say for a great many laws that are on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.451" offset="17433161">I can understand the House Armed Services Committee wishing to disassociate itself with that sentiment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.563" offset="17453641">The Floor debates are not anymore helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.708" offset="17466180">My learned friend is wrong when he says that there was a debate in the Floor of the House concerning counsel at Local Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.330" offset="17488645">The proposal made by Congressman Castermire was exclusively confined to Appeal Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.656" offset="17505991">There was no discussion at all on the Floor of the House about Local Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.346" offset="17520724">It is true indeed that the Morse amendment was entered on the Floor of the Senate, but it is quite clear I believe, as we point out in our brief, that Senator Morse who raised the question and Senator Russell, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other senators who participated in the debate were, and I must say this with all respect, acting upon complete misinformation as to what was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.997" offset="17603375">We indicate the colloquy on page 34 of our brief, that Senator Russell, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee, was stating quite incorrectly that the government appeals agent is independent and does not have divided loyalty, and stated quite clearly that there is a -- that there are separate counsel available for the Board and for the registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.164" offset="17691982">Now, this is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.782" offset="17698461">We indicate in our brief, in the long footnote on page 35 a number of other places where they were just clear factual error, clear misinformation on the part of the senators engaged in this debate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5064.859" offset="20362846">We had a little project in my office this summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.350" offset="20372773">With the assistance of a number of law students, we presume to read the statutes and the regulations governing every federal administrative agency searching for similar regulations dealing with right of counsel, and our findings are revealed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.632" offset="20421883">We found some 36 agencies which expressly provided for the right of counsel either by statute or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.169" offset="20444035">We did not find a single other agency in the system with the exception of the selective service system, where either by statute or regulation, there was an express prohibition of counsel under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.742" offset="20494294">Now, it seems to me that there has to be some better argument for sustaining this “everybody is out of step except selective service” attitude other than the quaint notion that it's just little groups of neighbors sitting around the general store and deciding what's best for neighbor John's son.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.354" offset="20572766">Now, the fact is that a whole series of cases in the District Courts and one in this Court, where unfortunately, certiorari was denied, presented very, very strong proof that many of the Local Board members do not reside in their districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.906" offset="20642983">And the response by the selective service system to this avalanche of cases has been simply to amend the regulation, to rescind the regulation requiring Local Board members, wherever practicable, to reside within the geographical jurisdiction of their Boards.</text>

            <text syncTime="5249.340" offset="21100753">I would say that the recognition of the constitutional compulsions had been true to themselves and indeed, with each term of this Court, the recognition increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.204" offset="21148191">And, I would hope that there would be a similar increase in recognition resulting from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.063" offset="21175672">May I just point out finally that the right to counsel is already recognized in certain aspects of conscientious objector cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.640" offset="21225932">It is recognized by the military in all of the in-service procedures, something which was noted by Judge Peckham and not responded to by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.624" offset="21257906">And, it was recognized for a period of 20 years, may it please the Court, under the old hearings held before the Department of Justice hearing officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.863" offset="21294791">I know, I participated in a number of those hearings in 1965 and 1966 and 1967 and indeed it is clear in the Nugent case and it is clear in the four decisions by this Court in 1955 that these were all -- these all had to deal with the proper status of due process in the Department of Justice hearings where it was acknowledged that there was a right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.364" offset="21400848">Now, finally, in response to the cries of alarm which are reflected in the letter by General Hershey in the record and reflected rather uncritically, I respectfully suggest, in the government's brief and their arguments that this will be the end of the selective service system, this will be paralysis, the nation will be left defenseless and similar hand ringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.926" offset="21487052">I think it's instructive to the Court and, with the Court's permission, I should like to read into the record and I'll make copies available through the clerk of a recent communication by the present National Director of the Selective Service System.</text>

            <text syncTime="5368.622" offset="21577853">We are aware of course of cases currently before the Supreme Court which deal with selective conscientious objection and representation of registrants by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.247" offset="21608364">It is our hope that, should changes be made by the Court in either of these areas, you will be able to help us meet the resulting challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.832" offset="21638666">While hardly an enthusiastic endorsement of my position, it is quite different from the cry that the selective service system will be dismembered if this Court decides that there's a constitutional right of --</text>
