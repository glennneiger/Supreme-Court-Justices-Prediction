            <text syncTime="22.305" offset="193578">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.563" offset="210610">These cases number 281 and 349, are here on writs of certiorari directed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.693" offset="251152">The Fourth Circuit adopted a new reasonableness test, approved the plan of the District Court for the junior and senior high schools, and vacated the decision and directed further consideration of a plan for the elementary schools requiring that the District Court apply a reasonableness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.280" offset="329519">The plaintiff's petitioned this Court for certiorari, this Court granted certiorari in Number 281 on June 30, reinstated the District Court's plan of desegregation and authorized further hearing by the District Court as had been directed by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.454" offset="402244">The District Court conducted further hearings during July 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.708" offset="419276">And on August 3, 1970, applying the Fourth Circuit's new test of reasonableness found a plan and had directed in February 1970 to be reasonable and reinstated its February 5th order.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.187" offset="473192">The school board appealed to the Fourth Circuit and petitioned this Court for certiorari prior to the decision by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.710" offset="503286">This Court granted that petition on October 6th, along with the petition of the school board to review the plan of the court with respect to the junior and senior high schools which the Fourth Circuit had approved as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.303" offset="565561">The court therefore has before it, the complete plan of the District Court which had been directed in February 1970, and re-approved by the District Court on August 3rd, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.599" offset="614776">We think that the decision of the District Court can be sustained under the equitable discretion of that court as authorized by Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.924" offset="652079">We submit however, that the constitutional principles by which the District Court was guided particularly the requirement for the elimination of all Black and racially identifiable Black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.660" offset="703070">On this record and under the circumstances of this case, we're clearly correct and should be sustained by this Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="159.811" offset="743612">Do you have to persuade us Mr. Chambers that they're clearly correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="164.536" stopTime="376.747">
            <label>Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers</label>
            <text syncTime="164.536" offset="762525">I think Your Honor that under the appellate procedural rules for considering cases on appeal that if there is sufficient evidence or -- to support the decision below that the court should sustain the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.986" offset="832324">The issues on this case are one, whether the school board may continue to perpetuate all Black or racially identifiable Black schools, where such schools have been created and fostered by state acts, and possible means are available to disestablish such schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.470" offset="906303">Secondly, whether the reasonableness test adopted by the Court of Appeals which would permit continued operation or state created, all Black or racially identifiable Black schools, although feasible means are available to desegregate such schools is an acceptable constitutional test to be applied in school desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.599" offset="998776">The facts briefly summarized are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.963" offset="1012255">At the time of this Court's decision in Alexander v. Holmes, County Board of Education, 45,012 up to 59,828 White students in this system were attending all White or racially identifiable white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.493" offset="1078397">16,000 of the 24,714 Black students were in all Black or racially identifiable black schools, these students were attending 82 of the 106 schools in the system, only 24 of these schools were not racially identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.108" offset="1152794">Judge Sobeloff noted in his dissent that the extensive segregation in this system was not fortuitous that it had resulted from practices of the school board which had interacted with other governmental discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.653" offset="1210995">So that at the time of the decision of the District Court, the Black and White population in this system, in school and at home, were virtually, entirely segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.447" offset="1258224">As the District Court noted, more Black students were in segregated schools in 1970 than at the time of this Court's decision in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.968" offset="1300229">The court had found in April of 1969, that schools had been segregated or their racial identity perpetuated by practices and policies of the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.418" offset="1342025">The board had located schools, controlled school size, grade structure, in order to maintain segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.201" offset="1373163">The board had also controlled school districts and transportation to perpetuate racially segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.275" offset="1401480">It is too late in the day, 16 years after Brown to now construct some ingenious device to avoid the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.931" offset="1436170">Black children and parents in Charlotte have struggled since Brown and began in 1965, with litigation in order to obtain a decree as the District Court entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.022" offset="1488520">They desired desegregated education and know that it can only be obtained under a plan like the one directed by the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.575" offset="1526659">It would be a rejection of the faith that Black children and parents have had in Brown, the hope of eventually obtaining a desegregated education.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.594" offset="1562812">For this Court now to reverse the decision of the District Court, and now adopt 16 years after Brown, a test that would sanction the continued operation of racially segregated schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.044" offset="3020549">One of the most pervasive was the practice of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, both before and after 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.046" offset="3052628">Both before and after 1954, the board located schools and controlled school sites to perpetuate segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.485" offset="3222319">The court further considered the governmental practices, which had contributed to the segregated housing pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.610" offset="3246874">The court considered the Urban Renewal Program, public housing, zoning, city planning, streets and highways, and private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.729" offset="3283341">All of these practices had interacted and created or fostered the segregated system that was before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.190" offset="3313121">Additionally, state constitutional and statutory provisions, which the District Court collected in its August 3rd opinion all contributed to the segregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.889" offset="3363903">The Fourth Circuit found compelling evidence to support the findings of governmentally created segregated schools and housing, and accepted the District Court's findings on the traditional practices of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.119" offset="3416879">The government concedes these findings and indeed asserts that these practices, particularly those of the school board contribute it to the segregated system.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.386" offset="3541953">The District Court sought to do this by directing the board to prepare such a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.825" offset="3559717">On three occasions, the board simply refused to submit a plan which would discharge its constitutional obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.685" offset="3587093">In December, in default by the board, the District Court appointed an educational consultant to assist the court in preparing a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.515" offset="3622410">The court directed that the consultant followed such techniques as were necessary to disestablish the all Black schools or racially identifiable Black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.756" offset="3659400">The court set forth 19 principles to govern the court consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.239" offset="3677372">We submit that the principles set forth were clearly within the discretionary authority of the court, seeking to fashion an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.324" offset="3713735">This is particularly true where the party principally responsible has failed to discharge its obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.863" offset="12335815">The test proposed by the Government and by the school board, we submit is unworkable and vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.862" offset="12375834">16 years of litigation have taught us that vague standards and test of good faith of school boards, merely prolong the day that Black children are able to enjoy equal educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.362" offset="12433826">This is clearly demonstrated in the argument advanced by the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.535" offset="12450544">While advocating a reasonableness test, the board contends at the Fourth Circuit doesn't know how to apply its own test, because the Fourth Circuit was sustaining the District Court's order with respect to the junior and senior high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.015" offset="12504461">This is further demonstrated by the recent case considered by the Fourth Circuit only a few days after the Fourth Circuit had announced its new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.467" offset="12538316">This was a case in Clarendon County, where small school district contended that it could not desegregate the schools by using reasonable means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.414" offset="12582097">Secondly, the fact of this case do not warrant any standard as proposed or adopted by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.217" offset="12609264">Again the facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.512" offset="12618459">We have a segregated system created by the state practices and we have at hands the means for desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.784" offset="12647508">The school board concedes that if it is required to afford Black children in the system and equal educational opportunity then the plan directed by District Court is the one that should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.773" offset="12691498">Mr. Wagner, my opposing counsel reaffirmed that position only recently, when it argued before the District Court during July 1970 hearing, stating, “So we take the position if the court please, that there is no reasonable alternative between the finger plan and the board plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.670" offset="12767044">The alternative suggested here or portions thereof are unreasonable and it was referring to the HEW plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.360" offset="12793793">And this places the board and the plaintiffs in a difficult position of seeing a situation where an appellate court has ruled one plan doesn't go for enough and the other plan goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.889" offset="12835903">We feel this is where the chips in this case fall, there is no middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.241" offset="12857323">We note that the Government suggests that the same devices used to create a segregated system may be used to disestablishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.748" offset="12887416">We agree and go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.573" offset="12898701">Nothing limits this Court or the federal courts to these same devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.925" offset="12920121">The court might use these or more or different ones or combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.168" offset="12941019">The school board, the government and now the amici, who have submitted briefs in this case, suggests any viable constitutional alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.861" offset="12975815">The board and the Government as we understand their positions, advocate that some non standard discretion be vested in the school boards to allow them to offer such desegregation as they deem feasible and to do so, when they think the time is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.224" offset="13037255">We do not think that the constitutional rights of Black children in this system should be left to the whims of what school board officials happen to be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.679" offset="13071109">The constitution would be a mere mockery if such were the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.487" offset="13086365">Nor do we feel that the alleged preference for neighborhood schools, which would preserve racial segregation, is an acceptable premise upon which to deny constitutional rights to the children in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.282" offset="13133490">Our record demonstrates as does it -- does the record in Mobile, that neighborhood schools became prominent vogue only when school districts were being required to desegregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.745" offset="13175390">Additionally, one cannot auger that there is any less neighborhood under the plan directed by the District Court in this case, than that proposed by the school board, and indeed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.592" offset="13222724">As we have shown, the only difference between the Junior High School plan directed by the District Court, and that proposed by the school board, is the board's connecting narrow links attempting to preserve its standard of contiguous grids.</text>

            <text syncTime="3794.114" offset="15280859">May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.176" offset="15297055">It has been a long road, we've made substantial progress and this is evidenced by the fact that few today question the central rightness of the decision which was reached by this Court in Brown against the Board of Education 16 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.928" offset="15388066">It's true that 16 years have passed, but in this connection that may be observed that the Brown case itself was twice argued in this Court, and before the initial decision, that it was pending here for two-and-a-half years before it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.568" offset="15470717">It was also here in additional year or a total of three-and-a-half years when the case was set down for further argument with respect to remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.627" offset="15530904">For many years, there was a serious problem simply in getting the decision accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.204" offset="15561206">I need not recall Little Rock and Oxford in the confrontation at the University of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.920" offset="15596105">All of that is in the past now, and fortunately and wisely so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.684" offset="15631109">Because of this situation, the court has only recently had occasioned to consider the many problems of detail, which arise in the application of the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.406" offset="15681996">On the basis of a careful survey, I find that there are 25 school cases which have been decided on the merits by this Court in the 16 years since Brown was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.214" offset="15745212">Many of these are per curiam decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.818" offset="15759632">One was Cooper and Aaron which arose out of the Little Rock situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.246" offset="15781366">Other cases involved various aspects of so-called massive resistance and interposition, such as Bush against the Orleans Parish School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.776" offset="15831521">Then only six years ago, in Griffin against Prince Edward County, the court held the schools could not be closed while public money was meant to support private White only schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.406" offset="15897976">During these years, many hundreds of cases were decided in lower federal courts and great determination and courage was shown there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.311" offset="15957640">Not until recently, however, has this Court had occasioned to focus on detailed aspects of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.290" offset="15989509">At first in the Brown case, there was only the start question, whether legally enforced segregation was consistent with the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.234" offset="16037366">This Court rightly held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.551" offset="16054606">The problem was inappropriately remitted to the school boards and the local courts to work out the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.713" offset="16087207">As might be expected, it has been found to be a vastly complex problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.372" offset="16117927">One can look at it first with a glass, and then with the microscope, and the complexities and the infinite variations soon appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="4027.944" offset="16216148">For many years, school boards and the courts too, to a considerable extent had felt that compliance was reached under freedom of choice plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="4108.858" offset="16539857">What is the standard to be applied, or the objective to be sought by a school board or by a court in reviewing what the school board has done is the standard or objective to achieve racial balance?</text>

            <text syncTime="4928.271" offset="19817493">It's clear I think that with the success which has so far been achieved, and it is considerable, though in many places not enough, there has been an expansion of rising expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.546" offset="19874544">Specifically, I think it is clear that racial balance was not regarded as the objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.597" offset="19898786">And I'm using racial balance in the sense of the brief from which I have quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.511" offset="19918430">Racial balance was not regarded as the objective when the Brown case was presented before this Court, or when it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.344" offset="19957823">In the Brown case, the United States submitted three separate briefs for the court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.790" offset="19987602">One was filed on December 3, 1952, and was signed by Attorney General McGranery and Philip Elman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.545" offset="20026577">The next brief was filed in connection with the re-argument of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.800" offset="20047579">And was filed on November 27, 1953, it was signed by Attorney General Brownell and by Assistant Attorney General J. Lee Rankin and by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.445" offset="20098152">And finally, a brief for the United States was filed in connection with the further argument on questions of relief, and this was filed on November 24, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.876" offset="20147890">It was signed by Attorney General Brownell, Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Rankin and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.373" offset="20185924">The position of the United States was the same in all of these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.113" offset="20200866">I think that all are relevant, but I will quote only two passages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.993" offset="20228347">The first in the brief filed on the first re-argument, on November 27, 1953, and this appears on page 171 of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.942" offset="20292190">It is not unlikely that in many communities particularly where separate White and colored residential districts still exist, abolition of segregation would produce no serious dislocations and no wholesale transfers of teachers or pupils would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.497" offset="20366378">This could result from purely geographical factors because the pupils of a school ordinarily reflect the composition of the population of the district in which it is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.615" offset="20426877">And then in the brief of the United States filed in connection with the further argument on the question of relief, we found the following on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.716" offset="20479227">There's more along the same lines here, I have only picked up the central passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.757" offset="20503468">The extent of the boundary alterations required in the reformulation of school attendants areas on a non-racial basis will vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.090" offset="20540771">This is illustrated by the recent experience in the District of Columbia, in recasting attendant's boundaries on a wholly geographical basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.734" offset="20579328">In the neighborhoods where there is little or no mixtures of races and where school facilities had been fully utilized, it was found that the elimination of the racial factor did not work any material change in the territory served by each school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.383" offset="20637947">And by a racial neighborhoods however, the objective of securing maximum utilization of facilities on a non-racial basis, could be achieved only by making radical revisions in the area covered by the formerly Negro and White schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="5215.517" offset="20966463">This was in the second and the third argument Mr. Justice, those briefs I quoted from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.049" offset="20992585">But in connection with the second argument and also the third argument, the court propounded specific questions to counsel, these appear in 347 U.S. at pages 495 and 496, and 4 (a) was this was the question of the court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.298" offset="21089552">Assuming it is decided that segregation in public schools violates the Fourteenth Amendment, (a) would a decree necessarily follow providing that within the limits set by normal geographic school districting, Negro children should forth with be admitted to schools of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.331" offset="21181712">It's perfectly plain that the court there was contemplating limits set by normal geographic school districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.012" offset="21216402">Now the oral arguments of all three of those cases have been printed in a book called Argument, and if they are examined, it is found that counsel for the petitioners there proceeded on the same basis, that the contention was not in favor of racial balance or the new formulation of that which appears in the present brief, but was in terms of eliminating a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.746" offset="21355374">And then finally, in the opinion of the court, in the -- in Brown too in 349 U.S., I think we find recognition of this understanding of the court and this appears in the opinion to that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration arising from the physical condition of the school plan, the school transportation system, personnel and here is the important passage, “Revision of school districts and attendant's areas into compact units, to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a non-racial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.277" offset="21537499">It's apparent I think that 16 years ago, when Brown was decided and 15 years ago on the decision on remedies was announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.469" offset="21578250">The objective was not racial balance and or the related objective is stated in the petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.935" offset="21620151">The conception of racial balance is something rather new, and it has a reason out of our experience in the intervening years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.306" offset="21657663">I think there is much to be said for racial balance in many situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.577" offset="21678665">But my submission is that it was not thought to be the standard or objective when Brown case was considered or decided, and I do not think that it can today be properly found within the text or within the appropriate penumbra of the two constitutional provisions which are applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.992" offset="21772392">Certainly this Court has never so decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.921" offset="21796112">Now with respect to the question of the Chief Justice, if the court will examine our brief with great care, you will find that we have never contended, we have never used the word reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.912" offset="21864030">We have used it when we quoted from opinions, but we have never used the work reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.328" offset="21889735">The word which we have used is feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.013" offset="21904468">And how far that is different from reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.198" offset="21921186">Is perhaps a question, I think it is some different and I will refer to it, one of the chief reasons we have used feasible is because that is what the court used in the Green opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.727" offset="21967266">Where the court said that it was incumbent for the federal courts to assess the school boards proposals under the orders of the court in light of the facts at hand, and in light of any alternatives which maybe shown as feasible and more promising in their effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.189" offset="22041140">Now I think that feasible is a stronger word than reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.857" offset="22059844">Reasonable is a somewhat negative word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.940" offset="22072174">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.236" offset="22073323">Well you don't have to do that because it would be reasonable, whereas to me feasible has a strong affirmative connotation, you must do it if you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.730" offset="22123269">You must do it if it is feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.553" offset="22130584">Feasible means practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.696" offset="22147197">I would point out that even the petitioner's have some qualification in their statement of the situation, perhaps that appears best in their brief in the Mobile case on page 75, their phrase is, “absolute unworkability” now that is certainly vastly stronger than feasible but even that shows that there are circumstances where they can see that that doesn't have to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.122" offset="22276869">Their wording is, “We believe that our proposed principle, forbidding relocation of pupils to Black schools except in cases of absolute unworkability of integration plans, has a number of merits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.996" offset="22340399">Now we believe that under the test of feasibility, which we contend for, that there is a strong governmental obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.449" offset="22382195">An obligation not only on the courts but also on the school boards, to -- not only to disestablish a dual school system, but to eliminate the vestiges of a dual school system, and here there is no doubt that there was a dual school system, we're really down to 1965 maybe a completely dual school system down to 1965 in Charlotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.614" offset="22498806">In Mobile down to 1969 and that much of the present picture is a vestige of the situation which arose at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.449" offset="22546244">And we believe that there is a very strong obligation on the school boards and the courts to eliminate not only the dual school system but the vestiges of the dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.860" offset="22603818">In that connection I would point out some things to which reference has not been made, steps have now been taken in Charlotte to provide for adjustment of faculties, so that they are no longer are White faculties or Black faculties in any school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.992" offset="22680409">Under the orders of the court, which we support segregation and busing, has been eliminated and finally there is even with respect to these children in the all Black schools who would be left in the two all Black schools under the HEW plan, there is free majority to minority election of, so that any Black student who wishes to go to a school which is not all Black, I know all the problems of that but still the fact is, that he can go to another school under the government's plan, it was not included under Judge McMillan's plan because he left no all Black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.321" offset="22861699">But under the Mobile order of the Court of Appeals, such children must be provided with busing and they are given a priority in the school to which they go, they cannot be told, “You cannot go to that school because it is already overcrowded.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5729.679" offset="23023135">There are no problems in the Charlotte as far as the government is concerned with respect to high schools and junior high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.337" offset="23057721">We have supported throughout the decision of the court which leaves no all Black high schools and junior high schools and requires a substantial amount of busing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.538" offset="23098577">The problem arises exclusively with respect to elementary schools and that becomes relevant with respect to this question of feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.529" offset="23138492">You're dealing with very small children and the distances of busing are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.237" offset="23169317">The taking away from their home areas are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.044" offset="23184572">I know that in countywide consolidated schools, small children are bused to ong ways but there you have the question of feasibility on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.691" offset="23231175">The all one room school house no longer became feasible and the only way it could be handled in an obvious improvement was to take the children in to the centralized school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.948" offset="23276210">So, in many ways the word should close together, but we feel there's something much stronger than merely reasonable action as required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.436" offset="23338172">The word we have found to use is feasible but that might well be backed up with further language to the effect that this is not meant in the passive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.236" offset="23381326">It is meant in an active way, and that in particular where there are vestiges of a dual school system, continuing steps must be taken to eliminate those vestiges but that finally, the test, the standard is not whether when you get sued doing all that is feasible, there remains one or more all Black schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="7790.339" offset="31265708">Now, there are several misconceptions about the facts of this case that I'd like to bring to the courts' attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="7798.255" offset="31297369">I've already alluded to the fact that we have promised great desegregation under the board's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="7806.608" offset="31330806">There has been a tendency of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and also the plaintiffs and petitioners in this case to suggest that the racial ratios of 69:70 is what the board plan produced, where we had 17 predominantly black schools, 5 predominantly black junior highs and one predominantly black senior high.</text>
            <text syncTime="7830.849" offset="31427772">But that is not what the board is here urging this Court to approve as desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="7838.547" offset="31458597">As our 68% of the blacks who are in the desegregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7844.069" offset="31480644">Another one is that and we have been continually unable to clear up the question of the instructions that we gave to the computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7855.706" offset="31527246">We asked one extension of time and Judge McMillan asked us, what are the instructions that have been given to the computer and we responded that we will not -- the computer will not make any assignments unless there -- if there are more than 40% black students in a student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="7876.674" offset="31611047">The reason for this was to gain stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="7879.829" offset="31623690">This school board wants to get out of the courts and get on with educating children and if we could build a more stable desegregation plan, this was our goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7891.586" offset="31670711">When the plan was finally put together of necessity, whites were assigned to minority situations in all of the black schools, ranging from a handful to 17%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7907.269" offset="31733509">Another point that I would like to point out is that we only bus 514 blacks to all black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7916.330" offset="31769767">May I ask the court to catch the connotation of all black schools?</text>
            <text syncTime="7920.811" offset="31787635">What about all the blacks that live in the county that go to desegregated schools?</text>
            <text syncTime="7925.657" offset="31807070">They receive transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7928.646" offset="31818982">We are told that we place schools so that they would be handed to whites -- I mean handed to blacks and we bus whites to the predominantly black school, I mean white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7940.748" offset="31867361">The court lists eight schools that has 96 children live around these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7946.201" offset="31889199">The court will look, these were county schools, all of them having varying degrees of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7954.840" offset="31923785">Alexander has 30% black, East Mecklenburg 10%, North Mecklenburg 28%, and Olympic 41%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7965.578" offset="31966730">These blacks have bused to schools where there are only 96 people living around these eight schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7971.472" offset="31990241">So we ask the court to not pay too much attention to the statement that only 541 students are bused to black schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="8763.050" offset="35156595">Let me give you one example of the shallowness of his findings and said, by the use of racial restrictive covenants, the only evidence in this case when it was over the District Court, it was a North Carolina case --North Carolina Supreme Court case involving Charlotte, involving the community called Chantelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="8786.336" offset="35249695">There, the Supreme Court says, “There is no uniform scheme of development.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8791.681" offset="35271116">Therefore, there are no restrictions imposed against this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="8796.943" offset="35292118">But because of the provision in the contract against sale to members of the black race, that part of the contract will be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8810.096" offset="35344781">Chantelle is a school that was predominantly white in 1968-69.</text>
            <text syncTime="8819.638" offset="35382920">We gerrymandered it and brought in children from the old (Inaudible) school.</text>
            <text syncTime="8826.045" offset="35408624">And now it's desegregated.</text>

            <text syncTime="8829.543" offset="35422521">But my point is, the evidence before the District Court showed on its face that there were no residential or racial restrictive covenants of uniform application on that property, right in the City of Charlotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="8847.556" offset="35494619">I have hoped in the time that I was here to point out the various aspects of the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="8859.744" offset="35543416">There is one thing that I would like to do and addressing myself to brief the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="8868.585" offset="35578734">On page 25 of their brief, they suggest that we should consider changing the great structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="8876.232" offset="35609349">There was substantial evidence developed in the record that Charlotte - Mecklenburg, is moving to an unrated lower school grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="8886.565" offset="35650623">This permits students to move according to their ability within a homogeneous group.</text>
            <text syncTime="8896.428" offset="35690120">The next they say, permits students to transfer from a school in which their race is in the majority, the one which is in the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="8903.952" offset="35720213">The courts below in adapting this technique also required that such students be provided transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8910.078" offset="35744664">The board offered transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8912.155" offset="35753023">This has been governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8913.675" offset="35759083">Charlotte has done this and it is opted under its board plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8918.150" offset="35776951">They say closed unneeded or substandard schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="8922.036" offset="35792520">Since 1965, we've closed and consolidated 20 schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="8929.598" offset="35822822">Is this a recalcitrant school board not exercising any affirmative duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8936.109" offset="35848840">Drawing what the zone lands -- so they cut across racially impacted residential areas instead of encircling?</text>
            <text syncTime="8942.361" offset="35873813">What do you do when you gerrymander with a computer that doesn't know where a highway or a creek or a railroad is.</text>
            <text syncTime="8948.570" offset="35898681">We've cut across these zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="8952.062" offset="35912683">As they plan new construction of school facilities so as to serve the students of both races.</text>
            <text syncTime="8958.833" offset="35939746">This we can recognize as being something that can be handled in a boarder zone between black and white areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="8968.701" offset="35979243">I read in the paper that a 480 acres Golf course, affluent neighborhood is going to be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="8978.604" offset="36018845">Probably some 400 to 500 homes will go in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8983.221" offset="36037235">This is located near the end of the County, southern end of the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="8988.528" offset="36058551">How do we build a school that will serve those students and also be desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="8996.685" offset="36091152">This is an enigma, the courts are going to have to face one of these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="9000.802" offset="36107557">How do you build a school when there's a vast separation between a large group of people of one race and a large group of another?</text>
            <text syncTime="9009.150" offset="36140993">This is something that is going to be an impossibility and I think the court needs to consider this in considering racial balance because if you go to racial balance, there's going to be a lot more transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="10589.703" offset="42463253">Number one, it had a great structure where for example, when zone number four, there are three elementary schools, I don't remember specifics but there's one group of children that go for grades one and two here and three and four here and then another one, and some of the zones, the children go to four different elementary schools during the course of their sick years of elementary schooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="10618.706" offset="42579237">That busing under it was the District Court Judge found was about on a par with what his estimates were of the finger plan and the board minority plan and furthermore they came out with ratios projected to 50% to 57% that we knew they would never stick, all in the world, you would have would be to end up with re-segregation and in the next place, they used schools in these clusters, in this mixing process which is another type of racial balancing, used and employed schools that were already desegregated under our school plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="10661.488" offset="42750391">Well, that in passing are the few reasons why neither the District Judge nor the school board had any tolerance for the HEW plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="10707.555" offset="42934606">Let me try my own articulation to a question you asked Mr. Wagonner.</text>
            <text syncTime="10715.747" offset="42967416">As far as the District Court's order is concerned, we are offended by it because it says that we can't have a black school.</text>
            <text syncTime="10727.231" offset="43013287">It is based upon racial balancing and it was a court order supplanting of a board plan that we feel was thoroughly constitutional because it was based and established its lines on completely non racial ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="10748.070" offset="43096670">Now that is why we take offense at Judge McMillan‘s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="10753.656" offset="43119031">As far as the Court of Appeals is concerned, I must digress to remind ourselves what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="10762.972" offset="43156334">It's then the objective of the District Court at all three instructional lesson, with elementary, junior, and senior.</text>
            <text syncTime="10769.646" offset="43182979">As far as the Court of Appeal is concerned, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="10774.542" offset="43202518">Well, we approve their rule or reason, simply because in our view, in the name of commonsense, you got to have a rule or reason about almost anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="10788.690" offset="43259152">So, but we say that the Court of Appeal applied, misapplied its own rule in the sense that it too issued a ruling that was based on the racial balancing for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="10802.829" offset="43315681">What did just Court of Appeals did that the elementary level, they say said, the school board -- you haven't done enough so Judge McMillan, you've done too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="10818.186" offset="43377121">There's too much busing and transportation in this location and so forth when that super imposed upon the secondary level, junior, and senior high.</text>
            <text syncTime="10829.145" offset="43421006">So in effect, this Court of Appeals found Judge McMillan's elementary plan to be unreasonable, you went back took another look at it and found that sure enough, he was reasonable all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="10843.072" offset="43476699">At the junior and senior high school levels, the Court of Appeals looked at and said yes that's not so bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="10852.908" offset="43515988">That's okay”.</text>
            <text syncTime="10855.259" offset="43525392">But in so doing it, they approved the satellite busing and the balancing at the junior high and what is the most glaring example already alluded to at the senior high, they approved that.</text>
            <text syncTime="10870.634" offset="43586936">That's the 300 black children from the inner city that bus 1213 miles out to independence high, that under the board plan had a 2% black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="10886.718" offset="43651302">It took to 300 from schools that we already had it almost perfect mixing under the board plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="10894.544" offset="43682544">And the only reason they bus those 300 black kids was to make a white school less white.</text>
            <text syncTime="10901.890" offset="43711906">So, really although the smaller problem, the most glaring single example of racial balancing is the senior high.</text>

            <text syncTime="11345.056" offset="45484575">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11349.387" offset="45501921">I will attempt to address that question because I think the issue of establishing a desegregated system and keeping it that way is one of the important practical problems that a District Court and the school board has to face.</text>
            <text syncTime="11372.759" offset="45595439">Let me begin however by stating that it is our view that Judge McMillan's decision is desegregation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="11385.503" offset="45646430">It can be a affirmed on either of two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="11390.778" offset="45667537">Either on the ground that he did not abuse his discretion in ordering a plan which remedied the wrong effect and also that it can be affirmed on the ground that Judge McMillan stated the proper constitutional objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="11411.952" offset="45752174">Well, I think it's helpful if we get down to specific in some of this, and not talk about some of these complicated phrases like balancing and so forth which have different meanings, and look at the practical problem that Judge McMillan faced last December 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="11435.285" offset="45845588">The situation was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="11437.471" offset="45854260">A month earlier, this Court had ruled in the Alexander case that integration had to proceed at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="11443.478" offset="45878293">Judge McMillan has just found that Charlotte-Mecklenburg had 25 racially identified schools in which 2/3 of the black children in the city were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="11455.821" offset="45927717">It also found that 90% of the fact is re-segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="11459.657" offset="45942972">And he had just received the school board's third integration plan, since April.</text>
            <text syncTime="11467.041" offset="45972543">And he found that in it they were asserting candidly they did not intend to eliminate all of the black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="11474.942" offset="46004203">So what he did was conscience that it was duty under Alexander to proceed expeditiously, he appointed his own consultant and he sat down to in the December 1st opinion, trying to give the consultant some instructions about what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="11497.609" offset="46094796">Now, Judge McMillan had found that the all black schools in Charlotte were created by state action and he concluded that it was his duty on the Green to adopt the plan that would remedy that situation, to establish that situation and he further had heard evidence that it was possible that there were plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="11525.994" offset="46208376">So he appointed an expert and he told him in the passage that Mr. Horack referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="11534.332" offset="46241708">That if the school board had come in with a plan, I wouldn't have required any fixed racial ratios or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11541.294" offset="46269607">But in default of them bringing you plan, you should sit out as pursuing the ideal objective of 29:71, but understanding that you may not be able to reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11560.483" offset="46346303">And you told them, you can use all of the techniques that the normal administrative techniques of assigning pupils and report back.</text>
            <text syncTime="11570.185" offset="46385173">And also told the school board again, you have another opportunity, a fourth opportunity to bring back a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="11581.832" offset="46431775">The plan that the judge's consultant brought back was not a plan which balanced every school.</text>
            <text syncTime="11589.754" offset="46463436">The percentage of blacks in the system under the plan that the judge ordered varied from the low of 3% blacks in the school to the higher 41%.</text>
            <text syncTime="11599.938" offset="46504187">Another point – the judge gave his consultant no instructions that he was to go out and integrate white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="11607.652" offset="46535011">The instruction was, that he was to eliminate the all black schools, and majority black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="11618.196" offset="46577225">And that was based on a conclusion that was possible to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="11623.045" offset="46596556">Now, in the final analysis, the district judge's understanding of what he was doing was that he was following Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="11636.391" offset="46649950">He was assessing the available plans and picking the plan that accomplished the best result.</text>
            <text syncTime="11648.287" offset="46697493">I submit that it is not error for a District Court in such a circumstance to require a school board to do more than the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="11657.457" offset="46734273">It's not the District Judge's job to try to find the fine line of the constitutional demarcation between a segregated system and integrated one and just exactly get them up to their minimum obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="11671.986" offset="46792370">It's duty as set in the Green case is to desegregate the system within the branch, to integrate the system so thoroughly, that segregation will not reoccur if that can be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="11717.929" offset="46976063">And now I'm at the point where I have Chief Justice's question about the duty in such a situation to try to plan an assignment system, that will work in terms of Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="11730.182" offset="47025173">And that will not immediately revert back to segregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="11735.933" offset="47048161">And what the court consultant did was to use these normal school assignment techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="11744.746" offset="47083374">Techniques that the school have been using all along, drawing school zones, transporting children to plan strategies, to try to avoid the situation immediately turning back to a segregated situation and he was doing this in a fact pattern, where he had a history of that in Charlotte, it had a series of schools that had been integrated and turned black.</text>
            <text syncTime="11774.478" offset="47202283">So that the effort was being made to prevent that from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="11778.673" offset="47219106">Again, now that the -- now and this really bring us I think to an important and analytical point, and that is that the school boards actually do control the racial composition of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="11796.612" offset="47290890">Necessarily they do because there really is no such thing as a neighborhood school that exists in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="11806.682" offset="47331119">The school board determines what the relevant neighborhood is for a school, by a whole series of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="11816.827" offset="47371661">Those are the decisions that relate to such things as where do you build a school in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="11824.503" offset="47402381">How big do you build it?</text>
            <text syncTime="11827.058" offset="47412621">And those two decisions already affect in a sense what its neighborhood might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="11832.859" offset="47435818">When you decide how many classrooms to put there.</text>
            <text syncTime="11837.249" offset="47453372">And then another decision that's made that affects it is when you decide how many grades you're going to at school and it's not true -- these cases contain records of the school board using.</text>
            <text syncTime="11854.209" offset="47521186">Those decisions to keep the place segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="11857.309" offset="47533620">In other words, if you had a compact black community in Charlotte, you'd build a school with all 12 grades serving it and the rights as per that black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="11869.169" offset="47581059">Now this was the kind of the jury action to affirmatively segregate that the District Judge had been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="11877.861" offset="47615854">We're not talking about things pre-Brown, before 1954, we're talking about what's been going on during all this massive resistance since 1954 as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="11995.311" offset="48085640">In other words, one of the assumptions underlying much of this is the assumption that if you have a compact residential neighborhood zone that that is non racial or neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="12016.447" offset="48170172">But that's not showing so in Charlotte because it's been established and found on this record that the neighborhoods were racially controlled by the state action and the schools were built to fit the racial neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="12039.359" offset="48261810">So it seems to me that the continuing duty to keep the school system integrated results not from any punitive sense or sense that the school board has (Inaudible) and that you have to monitor them for any continuing period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="12061.179" offset="48349163">It results from the fact that their decisions are inevitably going to affect the racial composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="12074.240" offset="48401408">The Solicitor General would have us think that the choice to be made is between something called neighborhood principles on the one hand --something called racial balancing on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="12087.465" offset="48454280">And I submit that is simply -- that's just simply not the choice that faces the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12099.146" offset="48500987">What the court really has to decide in the fundamental sense is whether or not the school systems are going to be required to be desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="12108.663" offset="48539021">So it's a result test that we ask.</text>
