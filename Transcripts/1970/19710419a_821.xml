            <text syncTime="7.285" offset="132472">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.387" offset="144906">This case which is here on a direct appeal to the United States District Court for the western district of New York, brings before the Court the validity of a 1955 merger between the two leading firms engaged in the printing of color comic supplements for newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.440" offset="221184">The appeal presents a group of typical Section 7 questions, the definition of the relevant product market, the question whether the effect of the merger maybe substantially to lessen competition, the question whether the acquired company was a failing company and the question of whether divestiture was a appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.258" offset="296417">There are three principal firms involved in this case which I will describe briefly.The acquiring firm, the appellee Greater Buffalo Press, at the time of the acquisition had a plant in Buffalo and also a plant in Dunkirk, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.321" offset="372694">The second firm is the acquired company, International Color Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.898" offset="394951">At the time of the acquisition, it also had two plants, one in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and the other in Peoria, Illinois but the Peoria plant has been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.206" offset="436224">The third principal actor in this story is a firm called King Syndicate, that is a division of the Hearst Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.974" offset="471228">King itself is not a printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.753" offset="482408">It is engaged in syndication of copywrited articles, features, comic scripts, cartoons, two newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.698" offset="518144">What King does is engages in two forms of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.700" offset="530160">First, it licenses features to the newspapers and secondly, it arranges for the printing of those comic supplements to the newspapers that wish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.334" offset="580733">The Government complaint which was filed in 1961 challenged not only the merger that is here before the Court but also alleged that Greater Buffalo, Hearst through King and another syndicate had engaged in a conspiracy to divide costumers, to fix prices and to monopolize the printing of color comic supplements alleged that King and the other newspaper syndicate had also engaged in illegal tying agreements under which the claim was that the licensing of the comic supplements was tied to the dealing with the syndicate for printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.886" offset="762964">In 1965, the Government settled a case against Hearst through the entry of a consent judgment under which there were various prohibitions upon Hearst including a prohibition upon engaging in tying agreements although the judgment at that -- that judgment does not preclude King from quoting a single price for features and printing for the licensing that is and the printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.210" offset="876231">However, that judgment also contains provisions that in the event Greater Buffalo is found to have violated any provision of the antitrust laws, the judgment may then be reopened.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="225.437" offset="1005171">16 since the merger filed, let me -- if I may explain just what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.234" offset="1024293">The merger took place in 1955, two or three years thereafter, an employee of another firm made a complaint to the Department of Justice that Hearst was engaging in tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.585" offset="1081762">Following this complaint and some preliminary investigation, there was a grand jury investigation in Buffalo, at the conclusion of the grand jury, the Government decided not to seek an indictment but instead to bring a civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.872" offset="1130872">Now, the original complaint did not relate of course to the merger, the original complaint related to the tie-ins by Hearst and King but in the course of our investigation, we developed other facts including the fact relating to the merger which led us to conclude that there were violations in addition to those that had been brought to our attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.970" offset="1207254">Now, the 10 years between the time that the complaint was filed and the case comes to this Court as occupied by a series of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.473" offset="1245288">First, two or three years were occupied by the Government’s first successful attempt to obtain a preliminary injunction against Greater, the transfer of certain assets in the Wilkes Barre plant of international to a plant that had been built down in Sylacauga, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.932" offset="1319058">Following that, we had the negotiations over the consent decree which led to the consent decree against Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.559" offset="1353644">The trial actually began in October of 1965 and of course, in the end of all, I might add that after we had gotten the preliminary injunction, then there were further proceedings with more testimony taken on a motion by the appellee to modify the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.670" offset="1422085">Following the completion of the Government’s case in October of 1965, in 1966 there was hearing on whether the Government had established a prima facia case and a year and a half elapsed after that hearing until the defendant’s case came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.273" offset="1496482">The defendant’s case came in in the summer of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.172" offset="1512051">Briefs were filed about a year thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.196" offset="1524172">Closing arguments were not had until a year thereafter which was in December of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.141" offset="1543920">Now, the reason for all these delays was basically, this is as I understand it, at that time in the latter part of the 1960’s, there was only one judge on the bench in Baltimore, that was judge Henderson of those Buffalo, I’m sorry, Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.820" offset="1606614">After a successor judge was appointed, the man selected for the post was the United States attorney and as a result, this new judge was not qualified to hear any of the pending criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.640" offset="1653948">And since criminal cases were given a priority, it meant that judge Henderson was required to spend the major part of his time in this period on trying the criminal cases and just had to work this case in as he could, that this was the reason for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.045" offset="1715597">I don’t think that the delay is attributable to the Government Mr. Chief Justice, I think it’s an unfortunate, I think these delays in these cases are always unfortunate, I’m afraid this was just one of those circumstances, we tried to do everything we could, we dropped a charge of violating Section 2, a monopolization charge for the purpose of trying to expedite the thing, we did everything we could to get the case moving because I think just one of those unfortunate things where the judicial process sometimes moves slowly.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.564" offset="1837641">That is correct Mr. Justice, that’s all we have appealed from, is the court’s dismissal of the Section 7.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="439.276" offset="1860524">Is that the reason Mr. Friedman why the monopolization charge was dropped?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="443.142" stopTime="834.713">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="443.142" offset="1875989">We stated explicitly in a motion, in a notice we filed stating that we were dropping the monopolization charges, we were doing so for the purpose of expediting trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.199" offset="1960208">That is set forth at page 518 and 519 I think of the record, that was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.412" offset="2089044">Now, coming to the facts of the case, most Sunday newspapers in this country have what I have in my hand a typical comic color supplements.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.112" offset="2135855">The supplement has two elements to it basically, a newspaper that wants a supplement has to get two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.222" offset="2168247">These different features are all copyrighted and the newspaper has to get a license for these features.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.303" offset="2196564">In addition, the newspaper has to arrange to have the supplement printed and the printing of comic color supplements is a very -- requires special skill, it’s not something that can be done, they’re done with four different inks and it takes great techniques to accomplish this.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.602" offset="2261765">The licenses for using the comic color comics themselves are controlled by the syndicates and the syndicate’s license to a newspaper as many of these particular comics as they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.375" offset="2312861">Sometimes, the newspaper will get all of its particular comics from a single syndicate more likely it will be a combination in this one of the Washington Post shows that the different comics come from half a dozen or more syndicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.673" offset="2378062">Now, approximately one third of all of these color comic supplements are printed by the newspapers themselves, the remaining two thirds are printed by the so-called comic color supplement printers which the two merging companies were the two leading ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.447" offset="2453191">At the time of the acquisition and even to this day, everyone concedes that Greater Buffalo Press is the leader in the comic supplement field, it is the most skilled one.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.204" offset="2496240">It is the firm that can produce the best product.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.167" offset="2515989">Both of these firms of course produced the same product.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.560" offset="2525602">The end result is identical whether or not it’s produced by Greater Buffalo or International, it’s this comic supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.224" offset="2556217">But the two firms follow a different method of distributing their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.144" offset="2575966">Greater Buffalo sells primarily directly to newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.648" offset="2593938">It sells to a few of the syndicates but basically sells to the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.093" offset="2611702">International has no business relations at all with the newspapers except that it ships the comics, it deals exclusively with King and it has dealt exclusively with King for almost 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.434" offset="2665096">King under the contracts is obligated to give at least 75% of its printing requirements to International.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.094" offset="2707728">The other 25% I might add in passing is because on the west coast, it’s just not economically feasible to print in the east and ship it to the west coast because printing is very expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.722" offset="2762271">Now, what happens in the case of King is that King goes out and actually sells the comics to the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.000" offset="2795395">King sells the comics to the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.588" offset="2805739">King has his arrangement with International and has had it for many years under which International does the printing and King’s profit of course represents the difference between what it pays International and what it can sell the comics to the newspapers for.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.161" offset="2871986">And the newspapers, all of their business dealings are with King, they pay their bills to King and King in turn then pays International.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.974" offset="2903228">But of course, the price that King pays to International necessarily determines what kind of an offer King in turn can make to the newspapers and not unexpectedly, as the record in this case shows that over the years, there were constant battles between King on the one hand and International on the other over price.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.449" offset="2985148">And King on occasions forced International to cut its prices in order that King could meet a particular competitive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.647" offset="3021928">King had something of a club over1210 International in this respect because up to the time of the merger, King had a six month cancellation clause in its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.434" offset="3061112">It could cancel for any reason within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.040" offset="3075532">At the time of the merger in June of 1965, King and International were negotiating a new printing contract which they wanted to be a long term contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.855" offset="3126836">About a month after the acquisition was consummated, they did sign a long term contract with the same prices they had before but it had no six months cancellation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.758" offset="3174379">However, and we think this is quite significant as I will come to in a moment, at the time the merger was taking place, a week before the merger agreement was finally signed, International and King had agreed upon the prices to be charged under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.740" offset="3246373">At the time of the merger, King and International each had sales of about $8,500,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.282" offset="3276466">There’s a dispute between the parties as to what their respective shares of the market was.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.728" offset="3298304">The disputes is over whether or not in calculating the market, you include in the market printing that is done by newspapers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.492" offset="3337383">The Government contends that that printing should not be included because we say while the newspaper might give its business to one of this printers, it's unlikely that any newspaper would be a source of printing for other newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.249" offset="3388374">Under our study of the market as we interpret under our evaluation of it, together, these two firms had roughly 75% of volume of printing done at the time of the acquisition under the --Mr.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.713" offset="3442186">You mean 75% of that two-third portion that you were talking about?</text>

            <text syncTime="838.255" offset="3456397">75% of the two-thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.774" offset="3466428">Under the defendant’s evaluation, the two firms together had just under 42% of the whole market.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.504" offset="3497357">Their 42% is 42% of the whole market, or it is 75% of the two-third.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.035" offset="3523480">But under either standard, these two firms simply dwarf the rest of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.943" offset="3543124">Each of these firms was at least five times as large as any of the other four or five independent printers.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.795" offset="3574575">Now, the facts relating to the acquisition were relatively simple, the original organizer of internationally acquired company had been dead for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.898" offset="3618983">The stock of the company at the time of the acquisition was owned by two of his children who had made no investment in the company, who had nothing to do with the running of the business, they let Mr. Gorman, the President of International run it and the sole interest was in the dividend, as they could get out of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.796" offset="3690559">And finally, they tried to sell this plant in 1952 to Hearst and King and Hearst was not interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.280" offset="3720443">In 1954, in the December of 1954, negotiations began between the President of International and the President of Greater Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.328" offset="3756701">International’s men indicated the property, thought could be purchased at the book value and that was ultimately done in June of 1955 at a price of $575,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.580" offset="3805706">The record shows that Gorman, the President of International kept King fully informed during the whole course of these negotiations of what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.836" offset="3854712">And three months before the acquisition took place, in March of 1955, the sale’s manager of King, a man named Knight wrote a memo to his superior in which he pointed out the key role that King occupied in connection with this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.400" offset="3932975">As he said that although the owners of International are anxious to sell, they can hardly sell without our consent and cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.080" offset="3967666">And he further added that the Greater Buffalo realizes they can hardly continue the purchased plans without our approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.679" offset="3998072">Now of course, the reason for King’s control over this thing is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.570" offset="4017612">Without the arrangements that International had with King, or International had with the printing plant and no costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.410" offset="4044988">International did not have any selling organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.298" offset="4056586">But on the other hand, King also had a very real stake in this thing because King at this time was basically dependent upon International for its printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.934" offset="4095143">And I will come in a minute now to what the District Court said and explain the significance of why this interrelationship as a practical matter meant that even though the contract between King and International was not signed until a month after merger in fact, at the time of the merger, Greater Buffalo knew that by acquiring International, it was acquiring basically King’s printing presses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.873" offset="4206843">The District Court held against us under Section 7 issue on really two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.740" offset="4230353">First, the District Court said that because of the advantage King has in selling printing as a result of its control over the features, there were two different markets here, one market said the Court was a printing of comic color supplements for sale directly to the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.951" offset="4307153">And the other market was for sale to the syndicates which then sell them to those newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.743" offset="4334320">And then the Court went on and said this -- the effect of this acquisition may not have been substantially to lessen competition because in the first place it said, Greater Buffalo and International not in competition, they’re not in the same markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.491" offset="4393357">International is selling to one market that is to the syndicates, Greater Buffalo is selling only to the other market to the newspapers themselves, they’re not in the same market so there could be no elimination of competition between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.542" offset="4445497">Secondly, they said that since at the time of the -- Court said since at the time of the acquisition, King had no firm contract with International, Greater Buffalo was not acquiring any share of the printing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.450" offset="4497220">It was just acquiring an expectation that with its skills, it could pickup some of this business and finally, it said I any event, International was a failing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.736" offset="4534314">Then at the end of its opinion in the last sentence of the portion dealing with the Section 7 violation, the Court said but even if there were some violations of Section 7 here would not be appropriate to order the divestiture 15 years after the acquisition takes place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.062" offset="4643610">Well, there is an evidence that there’s one firm developed very rapidly short in the early 1960’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.260" offset="4676420">There’s a dispute between as there's to the ease of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.505" offset="4693347">The District Court found that there were no substantial barriers to entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.918" offset="4711006">The claim is that anybody can print, all you need is a printing press, that there’s plenty of surplus capacity in this great ease of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.936" offset="4743084">We think that there are real serious barriers to entry in this business for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.308" offset="4760639">First, this is a very skilled thing, this is not just turning a press on and printing, you’ve got to know what you’re doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.418" offset="4789060">And the fact of the matter is that a large number of newspapers have found it financially advantageous to them to ship their printing business from their own printing facilities to one of these printers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.105" offset="4835767">In addition, once you have a firm which has 75% of the printing market available, that is for the purpose who don’t print their own, it seems to me this itself as has been recognized creates a substantial barrier to entry and I can say I know of no new firms that have gone into the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.453" offset="4913194">In fact, in 1965, I’m sorry, 1955 shortly after this acquisition, another independent color printer went out of business, that was a firm called Buffalo Color Press, a smaller printer which Greater Buffalo also acquired it was doing printing for another one of the syndicates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.510" offset="5005458">Now, we start it seems to me with a self evident proposition which is basically Greater Buffalo and International are in the same business, they’re both printing this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.778" offset="5050493">And of course, an essential element of the printing of this thing is getting it distributed to its costumers, to the ultimate costumers the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.774" offset="5082467">And it seems to us it doesn’t make any difference that a particular distributor such as King may have had some advantages in distribution, it’s still the same product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.383" offset="5128861">It doesn’t seize to be a differ -- it doesn’t become a different product merely because one firm is distributing it through King and the other firm is distributing directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.972" offset="5171284">And therefore, under the decisions of this Court, we think that the business of printing and selling color comic supplements was a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.160" offset="5212035">I stress the word “a” because it may well be that printing for syndicates is also an independent relevant market but certainly, this is a relevant market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.452" offset="5449226">The District Court found and no one disputes it that Greater Buffalo and King were engaged in active competition for the business of printing color comic supplements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.423" offset="5493112">And this competition between them and selling the printing necessarily reflected and was dependent upon the competition between Greater Buffalo and International in printing because only if International kept its prices low enough, would King be in a position to compete effectively with Greater Buffalo and I think the realities of this were recognized in 1954 in a letter that Mr. Gorman, the President of International wrote to the unions when he was complaining that the unions were putting very owner’s conditions upon but he couldn’t be with them because his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.451" offset="5645145">He said, he referred to Greater Buffalo repeatedly as his competitor and he was complaining that Greater Buffalo was taking business away from him because of the owner’s burdens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.590" offset="6045759">Previous to the merger, what you had was two very large firms, each with roughly 35% to 40% of the market competing with each other in four and five smaller firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.433" offset="6101138">After the merger, you had one major firm that really stood like a colossus over this market, had roughly 75% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.024" offset="6143457">The competition that previously had existed between International and Greater Buffalo in printing in keeping prices down and approving service necessarily was basically eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.957" offset="6199150">And while my opponent will tell the court as he had in brief that despite all of these facts, there was plenty of competition in the industry, the significant thing it seems to me for Section 7 purpose is whether or not this merger significantly lessened competition, and on that issue we think the record abundantly shows that it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.807" offset="6310640">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.345" offset="6328717">This is an unusual antitrust case. Its Genesis is this, a man by the name of Hornaday who worked for King which is a division of Hearst, so when counsel refers to King, he is referring to Hearst, Hearst Newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.388" offset="6436968">Hornaday left King for Hearst and went to work for another smaller syndicate selling color comic supplement printing, and while he had a little initial success he soon encountered the effects of the tie-ins of Hearst with its features and its printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.748" offset="6542399">Hearst would tell him to come up, you aren’t going to have your printing done through us, while you have to pay more for your features, typical violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.727" offset="6578239">So, Hornaday began to complain about Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.026" offset="6603525">In fact, he complained about the things he used to do while he was with Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.440" offset="6625155">And so the Government got busy, and started investigation of the industry at the instance of Hornaday who had not complained about us in any way and in the course of events, there was a grand jury investigation which resulted in the no bills, I recall it, and subsequently, the commencement of this suit in the year 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.766" offset="6726405">And a strange course of events at least to me a strange course of events ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.772" offset="6754408">The original argument trial counsel for the Government told the Court that the action was brought primarily against Hearst to stop Hearst from its tie end practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.292" offset="6812505">Indeed, it was brought for our protection and find that off repeated in the record, a strange kind of protection in the light of the relief by way of divestiture of our Sylacauga plant that sought in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.738" offset="6878333">Well, in any event, Greater Buffalo if I might take just a minute to describe it, had a very inauspicious and amble beginning back in 1926, the Kessler family, Walter Kessler who was a reporter on the newspaper went into business for himself but members of his family assisting him with an investment of a $1000 to $3,000.00, they put up a little printing press right in their own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.758" offset="7002363">Members of the family worked and they printed a little neighborhood newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.367" offset="7028799">And I guess they were helped by the depression in the 30’s because it began to print these mortgage foreclosures and happenings, and legal notices in connection with bankruptcies and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.866" offset="7082820">And they began to print a few adds for the local stores and started to print colored adds, and sometime in the 30’s, one of the Buffalo papers suggested to him that they might be able to print a comic section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.836" offset="7154709">Furnish them with an old press, they started to print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.342" offset="7168711">From that the start they to print for the 2927 newspaper and then from that Chicago paper and the thing grew, that’s one of the typical American success stories of its kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.521" offset="7229419">So, as the year 1950, 51, 52, 53 year all around, Buffalo Press by some innovations of Walter Kessler, its president, some ingenuity on the part of all of the hard work on the part of the whole family had succeeded in developing quite a business in this color comic supplement field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.490" offset="7341328">And they began to feel the effects of the King tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.137" offset="7363897">King had the major features, not only comic features but the syndication of the columnist popular of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.932" offset="7411127">And the competition between Greater Buffalo and Hearst as I put it, King if you please, was intense, there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.651" offset="7462013">We didn’t conceive it, we were competing with International which printed exclusively for Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.464" offset="7501197">Strange thing about it to me has always been, and I’ll say more about that when we talk about the absence of barriers to entry in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.220" offset="7552293">International never printed for the Hearst papers, they always printed their own, whole country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.260" offset="7580400">The Hearst papers print their own comics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.543" offset="7601507">While in any event, in 1951, 52, 53, Red Buffalo press build a plant on Lufkin, Texas to accommodate the self to the transportation charges more beneficial to its costumers in that area and began the plant, in fact, at an earlier date began to plan for a plant in Sylacauga, Alabama and it's that plant with which we’re particularly concerned and there’s more or less unmentioned by my opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.607" offset="7761795">I’ll have to get to that in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.017" offset="7771408">By then, in any event, the owners of the International, a golden family by name who lived, I think one of them lived in Cuba and one of them in Alabama and refused to make any investment in the company after the original investment and were contempt to let this man Gorman, a very competent operator who run the plant for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.816" offset="7874644">And now I don’t suppose, I could say with candor to the Court that by 1955, International squared with your decisions, definitions of a failing company but if it wasn’t a failing company then, it was destined to become one whatever artificial difference -– making that observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.995" offset="7983313">Its working capital was impaired, its machinery was obsolete and getting worst, its only costumer King was threatening to take the business away and put it somewhere else and in an answer to the inquiry from the bench, the first business of the King that Greater Buffalo got was in the year 1954, when the run from Youngstown Toledo and I think Erie Pennsylvania was transferred to it by Knight and of Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.243" offset="8124374">In the extreme, as in which International found itself, it sought to sell the plant, the business if you could call that to Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.790" offset="8174529">The opportunities were made, insistent opportunities were made to Hearst to buy it and the answer was Hearst wasn’t interested in it at any price and refused to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.415" offset="8224998">Mr. Gorman testified on the trial that he knew of no other purchaser so he offered it to Mr. Kessler of Greater Buffalo Press, Kessler bought it for $575,000.00 back in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.970" offset="8295215">Along was antitrust litigation that is ensued since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.813" offset="8318621">Now, at the time of the purchase, International was engaged in negotiations looking toward a long term contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.597" offset="8373791">Those negotiations had not ripened into a contract and at the time that Greater Buffalo bought it on June 25, 1955, it had no contract assurance of business and it took a calculated business risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.487" offset="8457279">But was the equivalent of some obsolete machinery which it hoped to modernize with its own techniques and make efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.071" offset="8523630">Well, there is an element to the case which I don’t think from which I think I should talk about for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.387" offset="8560933">After Greater Buffalo build its Lufkin plant or the Lufkin plant became a reality and Knight learned of it and about the time, the purchase of the International plant, Knight began to put pressure on Kessler, so as tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.636" offset="8677961">In other words, that he wanted to become or wanted Hearst to become the exclusive sales agent for Greater Buffalo Press and that Greater Buffalo Press should print only for International and there’s extensive correspondence on that subject in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.111" offset="8755806">And I would characterize it as a flirtation on the part of the parties looking toward a lineup where and whereby Hearst would be the seller, King would be the seller and Greater Buffalo would be the printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.031" offset="8835532">And it went on over a period two or three years and accounts for some of the documents in the record which had first flushed somewhat embarrassing, I think the King and Greater Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.685" offset="8886105">But in the course of events, Kessler was advised and Knight was advised that any such arrangement -- as Knight was proposing would be a clear violation of the antitrust law, that was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.701" offset="8942216">No dispute about the fact that the abandonment of their plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.800" offset="8970533">Well, Greater Buffalo went ahead and build the Sylacauga plant, five years after this acquisition and that’s what they wanted divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.463" offset="9029256">Now, I don’t care at the moment and for the purpose of this discussion whether you take the relevant market as that which the Court found or the relevant market as counsel contends that it should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.939" offset="9107101">The fact remains that there are no barriers, the interesting thing, people -- newspapers for whom we have printed and whom we thought we have so that because of our wanted efficiency have gone back to printing their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.549" offset="9189543">I think I can say without fear of serious dispute, certainly not effective dispute, that most any newspaper in this country can print its own and that there is great access capacity in this country for the printing of these comic color supplements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.103" offset="9267806">Your Honors know from your daily reading, most evening paper you pick up prints colored ads for stores or automobile companies, dress designers and whatever and it takes very little adaptation to put those presses to work, to print the colored comic supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.775" offset="9346487">Now, we cited in our brief and the governance exhibit show that certain newspapers print for others, that’s other newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.636" offset="9393925">Exhibit -- I think on page 1823 of the record is something that’s printed at page 14 of my brief, the red one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.586" offset="9433736">It shows that Hearst, the Hearst papers in Chicago prints for two non-Hearst papers, one in Chicago and one in Pittsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.042" offset="9491519">The same exhibit shows that Hearst plants have a surplus capacity for the printing of 12,504 page sections incidentally, that’s the unit of production, I was talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.652" offset="9577932">1823 Your Honor, of the appendix, as of the record, I mean the appendix of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.732" offset="9610324">Now then, I say that the competitive effects, if any were minimal and immediately dispelled long since dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.388" offset="9668942">I don’t have time but let me cite one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.981" offset="9687333">The principal competitor of Greater Buffalo Press runs head on to Greater Buffalo Press and at Sylacauga plant, the southern colored print.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.159" offset="9752012">It's an undisputed fact clear as a (Inaudible) in the records that between the time that we acquired International and the time of the trial that southern color which incidentally is Hornadey's company, the man who started all of this stuff has gone from 477,714 four page sections per week to 3,400,000 per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.619" offset="9889834">That during the same period of time translated in the dollars, it's gone from a $600,000.00 volume to $3,300,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.455" offset="9945213">It’s an established fact that every printing company that is a factor in this industry or was a factor in 1955 at that time of our acquisition has an increase in its business and it is an undisputed fact that most of the increase of the business came from us and that we took no compensating business from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.642" offset="10053987">Now, let me get to the divestiture and introduce Your Honors to that subject and I know that this historic courtroom, this Court has heard many strange contentions that I have asked this one or I call attention to one advance by my friends as one of the strangest that I’ve ever heard and perhaps if you -- now they say that this violation, this purchase of this old machinery back in 1955 took with it the planning which International had for a plant at Sylacauga, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.934" offset="10251160">And at page 37 of their brief they say effective relief in this case which would create a viable independent color comic supplement printer capable of providing King with an ultimate source of printing from Greater Buffalo requires divestiture of all the assets owned by International at the time of the acquisition and the Sylacauga, Alabama plant planned by International but constructed and operated after the acquisition by Dixie color printing company and the Buffalo subsidiary, Dixie color is the company who owns a title to the building which we built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.848" offset="10434748">Now, that’s cumulative to the effect that intended beneficiary of the requested divestiture is Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.486" offset="10469334">Now, in our early days of this case I repeat, we were described as the victim and Hearst was described as the predator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.130" offset="10511862">This is the first time, I ever heard a Government counsel seek the divestiture from the victim for the benefit of the predator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.176" offset="10560031">Now, let me give you the history of the building of the Sylacauga plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.418" offset="10597021">Right it, two or three people hid upon Sylacauga, might sound like a strange coincidence, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.829" offset="10638712">There’s something called the Coosa River paper company down there and as early as 1950, Coosa River paper company had called the Greater Buffalo to see if they could build a plant for us if we would take their product and use it in our printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.485" offset="10753337">Well, at that time, we were engrossed in going forth with Lufkin and we didn’t pursue it seriously, although we made some investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.013" offset="10799417">Indeed, that’s five years before the acquisition, back in 1947 which was eight years before the acquisition, we had planned a plant in the Deep South.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.361" offset="10848841">And in 1950, we had in writing which is a exhibit in this record, committed ourselves to Atlanta Paper, I forgot the name of it to build the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.546" offset="10897533">We did specify at Sylacauga but we said in the Deep South probably in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.599" offset="10925746">Well, it seems that the District Coosa river contacting printers generally to see if they could get someone to build a plant, also contacted International.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.340" offset="10972766">And that International had at least in the minds of Gorman, that operating head had planned to pursue the subject on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.013" offset="11027414">Well, he went to Hearst, Hearst wouldn’t give them a long term contract at the price that will permit the investment and a new plant Hearst as I said wouldn’t buy the International plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.628" offset="11085928">Hearst wouldn’t do a thing to promote the development of a plant in Sylacauga.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.326" offset="11112678">Now, after -- not before but after the acquisition, we built the plant, completed it five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.452" offset="11157191">Well, this I say in all confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.595" offset="11185716">The Government’s brief says that we changed some details and furnished some things, details, but we built the plant in accordance with the same plans which we have used some years before in Lufkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.656" offset="11265964">It is a reproduction of our Lufkin plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.679" offset="11282056">We went to Baltimore and bought a press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.242" offset="11300342">I heard the competitor bought the other available press from the same Newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.942" offset="11319150">I forgot the name of the Baltimore Newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.133" offset="11339943">The press was worked on transiently -- and the International employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.115" offset="11391875">This was after the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.227" offset="11400234">But we reimbursed them for all the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.886" offset="11414967">The plant was built to install the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.841" offset="11422699">The press was installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.986" offset="11439313">No equipment of consequence came from Wilkes Barre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.038" offset="11463555">The only equipment that did come was a little office furniture and I think one color duplicator or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.648" offset="11509948">We have the inventories in evidence as worth less than $350.00 in the aggregate and the plant cost us 3 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.117" offset="11551848">Now he says, or the brief says, that for some reason or other we should divest that plant so that Hearst could buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.250" offset="11604407">Preposterous, I say Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.060" offset="11615587">Now in continuing because that’s what the case is all about apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.621" offset="11645889">Did we build a plant for any business form Hearst?</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.900" offset="11662921">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.049" offset="11671594">74% of the Color Comic supplement printing which is done in that plant is by contracts made with Greater Buffalo and not International directly with newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.796" offset="11730526">They didn't afford to print it their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.523" offset="11749439">Now, 30% of the business down there is what we call commercial printing subject to which we have not alluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.705" offset="11786219">That means advertising for a chain stores, Sears Roebuck, Montgomery Ward, Safeway stores and all that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.132" offset="11831881">That constitutes 30% of the printing being done in that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.545" offset="11849540">And if you give up in fact to 30%, then 84% of the printing down there is ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.071" offset="11895620">And I think some -- that is from contracts of ours and minimal amount came from Wilkes Barre or from International.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.477" offset="11949328">Now, one or more things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.194" offset="11996139">This attempt on the part of the Government to make a printer out of Hearst or out of King, is so in Congress because time and again, the evidence showed and it’s undisputed that is a matter of policy Hearst would not enter the printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.046" offset="12087568">Option saving a statement by Hearst Senior Officer that I get it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.591" offset="12133752">This sums up the case from Hearst point of view what the Government is trying to point it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.718" offset="12158203">Mr. Green who is Mr. Knight Sr. said that Hearst would never be interested in printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.046" offset="12183594">Then he cites the fact that (Inaudible) sold 50 million gum drafts a year and never made one and made money not withstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.180" offset="12224136">Now, I just don’t know, I respectfully submit to you that under all the cases, as under any case on this subject, there cannot be a divestiture for equitable reasons, let alone those associated with the due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.253" offset="12300413">Now if he wants to talk about a divestiture of the old machinery, we bought 15 years ago up in Wilkes Barre, that at the moment is idle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.402" offset="12384946">I think all the arguments I am advanced, those showing that there were no anti-competitive effects, if indeed there was any technical violation, easy access to the market, the passage of time, the development and the growth of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.156" offset="12459969">Just one more thing is probably it is the least important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.391" offset="12472926">Merely days of the case, the unions were appearing, amicus here, whatever you want to call them, urging that we don’t take things out of Wilkes Barre predicting dire consequences to the economy if we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.456" offset="12537187">Why the economy has grown largely through what we have done up there if I might boast about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.143" offset="12563937">All our fears have gone away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.768" offset="12582431">Senator Sparkman was coming up to complain that if we didn’t bring things down to Sylacauga after we started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.703" offset="12618167">And I think we brought prosperity to that part of the country, would buy the newsprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.109" offset="12639796">We employ people, we do a wholesome business and I think it’s wholesome at this little family business and the tradition of the free enterprise could flourish as it has and do so well and violate no law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.037" offset="12923486">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.948" offset="12935189">The Government is seeking the divestiture of the Sylacauga plant not to aid the wrong doer Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.154" offset="12964028">But because we think that under normal principles governing divestiture, what you have to have is plant, the entity to be divested must be capable at functioning as a strong effective competitive factor in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.877" offset="13030902">Now, the way this market is now structured, what it means is for International to take up the kind -- to become the kind of plant that is necessary to provide competition to Greater Buffalo, it’s got to have a facility in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.658" offset="13097984">Because the newspaper customers down there now are used to a sudden plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.460" offset="13121181">They save substantial money as a result of the saving of transportation costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.350" offset="13148766">We’re not of course suggesting –- as Mr. Raichle somehow suggested that we’re trying to put Hearst into the printing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.747" offset="13170395">Well of course, we’re not saying that the plant has to be divested to Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.425" offset="13185024">All that we are saying is when you divest International and of course I just mentioned in passing divestiture is the normal remedy, when you have a -- has stock out position that violates the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.710" offset="13226193">When you divest it, you got to divest it in a way that makes it into a strong competitive force in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.769" offset="13250435">And that requires, we think Sylacauga Plant be included.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.709" offset="13266213">What do you think about the equities or divestiture, 15 years after the event in the face (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3309.952" offset="13343222">Well, I think Mr. Justice that the equities relating for the situation of the individual firms in this situation must be bounced against the demands of the public interest in restoring effective competition here and I think that in this situation, it is appropriate to divest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.898" offset="13422947">I’d like to add if I may just one thing on how this Sylacauga plant was developed for a year before the acquisition, International was playing a very active role in working out its own plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.747" offset="13490343">Many of its people had made lengthy trips to Sylacauga to investigate the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.367" offset="13516884">International was under constant pressure for King to build a southern plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.835" offset="13538722">And indeed, they had written in the Spring of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.886" offset="13562964">International had twice informed the Chamber of Commerce of Sylacauga that it had definitely decided to move to Sylacauga, to build a plant in Sylacauga.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.505" offset="13605386">And it’s true that at that point, it did not have the financing available but it seems in the light of the pressures that were coming upon International from King and in the light of all these extensive plants, it’s certainly most reasonable and most likely that it -- there hasn’t been a situation, International somehow would have found a way to build the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.613" offset="13685844">Now it’s quite true the plant was actually built by Greater Buffalo and Greater Buffalo paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.107" offset="13711757">But it seems at least in inception and spirit of the thing, that this was enough of an International plant that it would be appropriate to require that it be divested in order to establish the kind of a strong company that is necessary to restore competition in this industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.868" offset="13822830">There’s nothing remarkable about but with this exception Mr. Chief Justice, this move into the Deep South was not the typical move where a firm finds that this is an attractive area for various reasons to develop a new factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.629" offset="13885837">This move into the Deep South was because of the -- basically because of the transportation situation, that is the newspapers located in the Deep South would be much better-off financially if they had a nearby plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.378" offset="13944874">And it’s the newspapers I should mention, it’s the newspapers not the printers that pay the cost of transporting the supplements form the printing plant to the newspaper plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.363" offset="13988864">And I think, this is what’s involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.445" offset="14001194">It is an attempt, it is, they moved in there because they needed the plant and I think is a realistic matter if you divest International.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.245" offset="14036302">If you divest International without this plant down south, it’s going to be very difficult for there to be any really effective competition created by International.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.676" offset="14078098">And that it seems to us is the basic purpose of relief in this case.</text>
