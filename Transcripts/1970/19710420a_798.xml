            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="17.610" offset="173850">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.212" offset="184195">These combined income taxes cases are here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.556" offset="205615">They involved the Louisiana community property system.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.476" offset="221288">In each case, a husband and wife living in Louisiana realized community income of which each own one-half under the Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.416" offset="269040">No federal income tax returns were filed by either spouse, either separately or jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.525" offset="293491">The marriages were subsequently dissolved and the Government separately assessed each wife for the income taxes on her share of the realized but unreported community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.560" offset="337586">The cases present a single question whether where no returns have been filed a Louisiana wife must report and pay the federal income taxes on the one-half share of community income which under the laws of that state she owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.734" offset="402265">In each of these cases, the Fifth Circuit held that she need not do so where she neither expressly accepts liability for those taxes nor receives any benefits from the community property upon the dissolution of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.559" offset="457644">We believe that in doing so, that court failed to perceive an important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.939" offset="479169">One which we feel underlies the decision in this case, that is the distinction between imposition of the tax on one hand and collection of the tax from the individual owing it on the other.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="106.279" offset="528488">Mr. Bray, could you tell me one detail, is the income of the community on which the deficiency was determined due to the wife’s earnings or income from her property at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="122.529" stopTime="152.264">
            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="122.529" offset="593481">In the Mitchell case, it was partially due to her earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.792" offset="610513">In the Angello case, the record indicates that all of the community income was due to the husband’s earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.860" offset="634859">In neither case, was any significant amount of income due to the wife’s individual separate efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.570" offset="661608">This however, we do not believe determines the case since regardless of who generates the income, under the Louisiana law, each spouse owns an undivided one-half interest of it from the very moment it comes into being.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="152.264" stopTime="157.322">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="152.264" offset="712391">This has to be your position necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.296" offset="720541">It’s rather reminiscent to the old embezzlement cases, isn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="157.322" stopTime="270.820">
            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="157.322" offset="732662">Yes, sir and even before that, the split income cases in the 1930 term of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.390" offset="756903">To that, we think those cases decide this case and compel the result for which we here content.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.519" offset="785429">Our position is that this case involves only the imposition of the tax and that because the wife owns her share of community income, she is tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.741" offset="826284">While we recognize that our position may result in hardships in certain instances to why as residing in community property states.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.764" offset="858467">Yet, we think the law is clear and compels the position that we take.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.903" offset="874977">At least as the statutory law presently exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.796" offset="890546">In some, we argue that it is now and for many years prior to this well established that the federal statutes imposed the tax against the owner of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.233" offset="932342">That under Louisiana law, the wife owns outright her one-half interest in community income as of the very moment that it comes into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.034" offset="967555">And that it follows that she must report and pay taxes on her half.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.371" offset="988871">On the other hand, as regards to the collection of these taxes, we think there is no real dispute on our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.606" offset="1017814">The state laws exempting the Louisiana wife from community obligations and we would here acknowledge that taxes -- federal income taxes, all community income are indeed a community obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.097" offset="1071731">But these state laws exonerating the wife from the community obligation simply are ineffective as against the United States in its efforts to collect the tax from the individual owing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.569" offset="1121677">The dispute here really is whether the wife’s ownership of her community income -- her share of community income is sufficient under the federal statutes for that statute to impose the tax against her and compel her to return it and pay tax on it.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="270.820" offset="1186670">Mr. Bray, is that renunciation Louisiana provision common to all community properties?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="276.013" stopTime="325.810">
            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="276.013" offset="1207463">It is not, it was common in the Spanish law.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.739" offset="1218330">It arose under the Spanish law, but as far as we can tell, Louisiana is the only state which has carried this over from the Spanish law.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.602" offset="1257827">I might point out in that regard that even under the Spanish law, it was very clear that during the existence of the marriage the wife owned that right her half of community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.907" offset="1302967">The renunciation provision was merely one designed to protect her from community creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.759" offset="1326373">Again, community creditor or rather a creditor right type of proposition which gave her the right upon determination of the marriage to forego her otherwise vested interest in the community income and for that matter, all community property, and similarly to be relieve of any obligations all community debts.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.104" offset="1419786">That’s correct, in fact in these cases, one dissolution occurred because of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.958" offset="1443192">Does it apply in the reverse?</text>
            <text syncTime="336.613" offset="1449775">Does a husband have the same right?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="338.310" offset="1456567">No, the husband does not and this is because again originating from the Spanish law.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.070" offset="1475688">The husband has the management generally speaking of the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.939" offset="1491153">It was therefore thought that because he manages the property, he ought to be responsible for the community debts regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.076" offset="1519679">And indeed, historically, not only was he responsible in the sense that the community property was responsible for the debts, but he personally was responsible for those community debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.702" offset="1562206">In other words, if the community was not sufficient to take care of the community debts, he had to come out of his own separate property to pay those debts.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="383.316" offset="1636603">Yes, that is part of a theory, but I would point out that there are protections for the wife while she can’t perhaps compel the husband to pay the taxes as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.515" offset="1673383">Yet, she does have protections under state law which are very clearly spelled out not only in the state law cases, but for that manner in the two cases in which this Court has dealt with Louisiana community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.467" offset="1725210">Bender versus Pfaff, the split income case and Fernandez versus Wiener, the state -- I beg your pardon, the federal state tax case and in both instances it was noted that while the husband had management rights over her half of community property nevertheless, that she had some rather special provisions of state law which protected her interest in that property, including the right to separate her property from her husband’s without terminating the marriage and from that point forward to have complete control over her property.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.155" offset="3308022">The problem is not one of our making but rather one of the community property laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.637" offset="3325889">Historically, the community property laws have provided community property husbands and wives with some rather significant advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.025" offset="3363506">Before of the day of the joint return and I might add that the joint return came into being essentially because of these advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.552" offset="3393599">Before the day of the joint return, the spouses could split their income, report it separately and thus avoid or at least lessen the impact of the graduating income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.391" offset="3436962">When this Court held in the 1930 term upheld the right of the spouses to do this in the series of cases are found in Poe versus Seaborn, the advantages were very clear cut and the Court established at that time that taxation follows ownership in so far as the individual taxpayers concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.472" offset="3521285">We think that that compels the position which we take here that the wife owns her share and she must pay taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.694" offset="3550124">And I might add that since 1930, that has been a whole basis of the taxation of individuals in the Federal Income Tax Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.836" offset="3582725">That is its tax the income to its individuals and this has been repeatedly recognized and the Congress has acted on this understanding of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.390" offset="3616893">Indeed, the recent amendments serve to emphasize this once more, in those amendments or rather in the legislative history of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.529" offset="3653465">The congressional reports indicate that except for the amendment, Congress recognized that in the community property state, the wife would be deemed the owner of one-half of all community income and would have to report and pay tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.276" offset="3708426">And because of that, the Congress inserted in this amendment amending statute a provision relieving the wife of liability in the joint return situation or where she otherwise would have that liability not just because she signed the joint return but because she own the income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.302" offset="4180616">And bear ownership on the other and I might add that in a subsequent dissent, Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out that this was the technical distinction made and that now, ownership determines who is liable for the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.163" offset="4260028">As I’ve indicated both state and federal law is important for the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.036" offset="4287509">The state law creates the legal interest involved while the federal statute taxes those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.071" offset="4311646">In our view, it is clear that the federal statute taxes income to the individual who owns it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.583" offset="4337664">This was decided in the 1930 series of cases and has been bedrock with respect to subsequent revenue legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.811" offset="4374653">We don’t see anyway around this at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.782" offset="4390536">Now, with respect with to the state law, we think it’s equally clear that the wife owns her undivided one-half share of the community income and we don’t think there’s any real dispute either with respect to the respondents or for that matter with respect to the Fifth Circuit on this particular topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.642" offset="4469948">Indeed, the Fifth Circuit said in its opinion that under the Louisiana law, the wife has a present vested ownership interest in one-half for the community property including its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.716" offset="4514252">The Court could only say this following not only the decisions -- the many decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court so stating but also the decisions of this Court in Bender versus Pfaff and in Fernandez versus Weiner so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.552" offset="4573602">But the Court went on to say, it rejected what we say must follow that is that the wife must report and pay taxes on her half by saying that under Louisiana law, the wife’s interest in the community is of such a character that she is not personally liable out of her separate property for the tax of her share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.436" offset="4653119">We think in this regard, the Court confused collection of the tax which state law does provide protections that would ordinarily protect the wife from community creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.596" offset="4701706">And imposition of the tax, which we think is truly the issue here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.499" offset="4729396">The Fifth Circuit rested its decision -- its decision that the wife’s ownership interest was qualified sufficiently that she could not be held responsible for the taxes on her share essentially on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.117" offset="4787806">First, on the ground that the husband had very broad management rights over the wife’s community property not only over his but also over the wife’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.343" offset="4824795">And secondly, that the wife’s property was -- I beg your pardon, that the wife’s separate property was generally protected from community creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.547" offset="4857605">However, under the state law, again as that law has been recognized in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.804" offset="4882578">These two features of state law simply are ineffective in so far as protecting the wife from the taxation that is listed upon her because she owns the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.209" offset="4928240">They do not -- these features do not owe to the fact that she owned that right her share of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.669" offset="4962095">And we think that she must report and pay her share -- I beg your pardon, the tax on her share of the income based on this Court’s decisions in the 1930 split income tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.684" offset="5014131">Admittedly, these cases did not bring before the Court the question of whether the wife is required to report it, but rather only whether she was entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.363" offset="5052792">But we think a case decided along with these cases in that same session of the court made clear that not only may she do so but she must to do so where the spouses have not otherwise reported their income on a joint return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.453" offset="5121233">This is the decision in United States versus Malcolm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.081" offset="5135653">Malcolm was decided some five years after an earlier Supreme Court decision in United State versus Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.759" offset="5166373">In Robbins, this Court had decided that in California at any rate, the husband must report and pay taxes on all of the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.929" offset="5203048">In Robbins, the court based its decision on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.705" offset="5218200">Primarily, on the holdings of the Supreme Court of California that the wife’s interest in community property during the existence of the community was merely an expectancy, she had no present vested interest in the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.147" offset="5272012">Alternatively, the Court bounded its decision on the fact that the husband had such broad management powers that this would entitle Congress to tax all of the income to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.675" offset="5314121">In recognition of this decision, California subsequently amended its laws and stated unequivocally that the wife’s interest in the community during the existence of the community was a present existing interest equal to that of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.195" offset="5380159">Following this amendment and the statutes were not amended significantly with respect to the husband’s management powers, he still manage his wife’s share of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.588" offset="5425716">But following the amendment with respect to the vested interest versus expectancy interest, Malcolm versus United States came before this Court and in a per curiam opinion based upon the Court’s split income decisions in Poe versus Seaborn and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.653" offset="5486007">The Court held that under the federal statutes, the husband need no longer, the California husband need no longer report and pay taxes on all of the community income in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.715" offset="5534281">They further held that the wife’s interest under state law were such but she should and I use the word “should” because that was the question posed to the Court that she should report and pay the taxes on her share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.003" offset="5591333">We think that this makes clear the position that we’re here taking and indeed every court up until the Fifth Circuit’s decision is here who has considered this question has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.516" offset="5645458">Now, in doing so, we would suggest the court abandoned the management ground on which Robbins had alternatively based the decision to tax the husband on all of the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.705" offset="5706167">The court instead opted in favor of ownership -- bear legal ownership and made clear that management is not the touchstone under the Code rather ownership is the key and whoever is the owner must pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.758" offset="5770428">I might point out that this is not unlike the situation in several other areas of the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.308" offset="5800626">Specifically, the partnership area, the wife’s interest has been compared by the Louisiana Courts to that of a limited partner and a limited partnership just as unlimited partner must pay taxes on his share of partnership income so the wife must.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.559" offset="5873560">And this, mind you whether or not the partner is around at the time the partnership returned and the individual returns should be filed and whether or not the partner has ever made distributions of the partnership income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.144" offset="5927999">Thus, if the partner absconds with all of the partnership funds this does not relieve the limited partner in any respect from his obligation to pay federal income taxes on his share of the partnership income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.538" offset="5989543">Similarly, in the situation where a grantor creates a trust and because he is also the beneficiary of the trust, he is taxed on its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.930" offset="6031130">If the trustee absconds with all of the trusts income, the grantor beneficiary would not be relieved of his obligation to pay taxes on the trust income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.270" offset="6084420">Thus, we can see no reason to suggest that taxing the wife on the share of her income is unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.750" offset="6130395">There is just no basis for this as far as we can tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.061" offset="6143666">We have been able to find no cases suggesting that this would be such an unfair and invidious tax system of taxation as to render it unconstitutional and we note that while our opponents suggested that it would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.874" offset="6202911">They do not either cite any authority for this proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.867" offset="6470823">No, we don’t but I might add that the Fifth Circuit didn’t base its decision on renunciation per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.578" offset="6505723">The Angello case makes this quite clear as thus the subsequent Ramos case, which comes out of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.866" offset="6530800">In Angello, there was no form of renunciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.333" offset="6544697">There, the husband died and the wife merely -- there’s no evidence that she got anything from the community that previously existed between the spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.027" offset="6579493">She did not formally renounce her interest in the community under Article 2410.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.272" offset="6600495">Ramos as I say, comes out of Texas and there, there is no renunciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.254" offset="6620348">However, in both Angello and Ramos, the Fifth Circuit based on its Mitchell holding found that because the spouse -- the wife had not received any benefits from the community and had not expressly agreed to be bound by her share, on her share of the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.905" offset="6683042">She could not be made the pay that share of the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.974" offset="6703313">If the Court accepts what we think is the clear law, one that the wife is the owner of the tax and two, that as the owner, she must report and pay the taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.612" offset="6749811">I beg your pardon, one, that the wife is the owner of her share of the income and two, as the owner, she must report and pay the taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.723" offset="6782307">Then, we think it follows that the Government is entitled to collect those taxes from any property she has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.704" offset="6834239">I don’t understand the respondents to seriously object to our propositions in this regard which we have set out fully in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.852" offset="6866735">Rather, their objection just as the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is to whether or not the wife’s ownership is sufficient to impose the tax against her in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.708" offset="6910203">If indeed, she -- the tax is imposed against her and she owns it then it’s clear that the federal collection statutes prevail over state exemption laws and entitle us to collect the tax for many property that she owns except there’s --</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.945" offset="7255124">Those benefits were before the Court in the split income cases and this is merely the other side of the coin from state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.744" offset="7282395">Now, of course the state can change its law just as Congress could amend the revenue statutes with respect to these specific hardship areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.191" offset="7320116">Indeed, my understanding of California law is that there, if the husband abandons the wife, the income which she subsequently owns which is the Ramos case is his separate income and the wife has no interest -- no ownership interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.328" offset="7392632">And thus, would not be obligated to report and pay taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.947" offset="7407156">There’s nothing to preclude, I presume Louisiana from doing the same where that the -- and that’s truly the hardship case more so and I think than Arms where the wife was residing with the husband and indeed in all probability shared with him whatever earnings he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.171" offset="7480090">And today is where all, the wife does indeed spend quite a bit of the income which even her husband makes and I think it’s only realistic to recognize that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.833" offset="11450702">The problem is, the tax problem arises from the fact that the community is not a tax paying entity and -- or define an individual or individuals who will pay its tax, the community’s income must be attributed to some person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.802" offset="11514546">The question then it really and truly is not whose income is it, but to whom should it be attributed Now, Poe v. Seaborn, did not, which held that the husband and wife in split income was not based upon the concept that the husband and the wife own the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.798" offset="11594585">It was based upon the rational that neither owned it and sets one -- the case said, that the opinion said that it could not be said that one owned it more -- any more than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.589" offset="11641710">And as a result, they were permitted to split the income, but that is not the same thing it saying that one owns the income or the other or both own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.596" offset="11677759">Mitchell says, that Seaborn permitted both to file returns and split the income that this is a -- that the whole rational of Seaborn if they did not and if we do not look -- Mitchell said, that if the husband and wife do not split the income and file returns, they say, if they do the wife has assumed the liability by virtue of filing the return that return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.247" offset="11776397">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.438" offset="11777128">Because Seaborn said, she could file the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.928" offset="11787055">But if they did not split the income and file returns that the court should then look to see to whom should the income be attributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.057" offset="11819551">The Fifth Circuit said, “The income should be attributed to the husband because he had control of the property and because to treat it any other way was to reap up the community property law unnecessarily by the use of the tax law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.204" offset="11876185">It said, “The husband was liable for the debts of the community, that this was by its nature a community debt and the husband was the logical person to pay the tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.141" offset="11923937">Mitchell does not conflict with Seaborn unless, that the import of Seaborn laws that the husband could only be required to pay on one-half or that the wife was liable for one-half of the tax on her separate property without regard to anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.182" offset="12004080">If that is what Seaborn meant although it did not say that, we suggest that this Court should overrule Seaborn because that is an illogical interpretation of Section 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.876" offset="16678849">I’m here on behalf of the other respondent Frances Angello and Your Honors if you would indulge me for just one moment, I cannot stand here and launch on my argument without noting that after almost 20 years before the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.622" offset="16741857">This has to be the one of the greatest moments of a professional career to argue a case before this High Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.497" offset="16777383">And I do thank the Court for allowing us this few additional minutes to make this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.118" offset="16803819">Your Honors, the policy that we have submitted in the Government’s position in this case is in and all the simple of occasion of an issue and in a failure to consider that which this Court has held must to be considered in order to make a determination such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.571" offset="16889605">For instance, my opponent made the statement a moment ago that state law creates a legal interest while federal law taxes those interests so created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.882" offset="16946866">That statement is incomplete, that is not with this Court has held and if that were a complete statement of the law, the logic of the Government’s position may very well follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.262" offset="17000469">But what this Court has held and what this Court has said, I think it’s more accurately put in the Government’s brief on page 14 and 15 where they said that -- excuse me Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.877" offset="17142888">The Government has cited the case of Morgan versus Commissioner on page 14 of its brief and in that case, the Supreme Court held that state law creates illegal interests and rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.847" offset="17202761">The federal revenue acts designate what interests or rights so created shall be taxed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick M. Schott</label>
            <text syncTime="4294.997" offset="17283323">That statement is “that the federal government taxes interests that are created by the state, but state law determines what those interests are.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.448" offset="17353122">Now, what I have said is that if that standing alone were under consideration before the court then the logic of the Government’s argument might follow that therefore, such things as the exemption if you will of the wife separate property from vulnerability of seizure by a community creditor or mere exemption statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.851" offset="17442774">But that is not what the law is, what I say the law is that federal law indeed does designate the interests to be taxed but also the rights that the state law creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.281" offset="17504528">Federal law designates the rights that are to be taxed also and I say that in that omission by the Government of a look at what is the right of the wife to renounce the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.868" offset="17562833">In that omission, is the crux of the Government’s error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.442" offset="17585089">Under Louisiana community property law, it is true that the wife has a present vested interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.288" offset="17624482">However, that law says that she has a right to renounce the community and under our holdings of our Supreme Court, it is as though the community never existed as far as she was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.915" offset="17691042">Now, the reasons for this of course have already been touched upon by my colleague Mr. Kirkpatrick in talking about the almost unlimited control that the husband has over the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.328" offset="17744645">For instance, an answer to a question by the Chief Justice, the question was, can the husband alienate the homestead?</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.058" offset="17775574">The answer for that question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.732" offset="17786337">Now, there is a provision in the state law which gives the right to the wife to file a declaration of homestead and prevent the husband from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.822" offset="17830640">This is not usually exercise and if the ownership or title of the property is taken in the name of the husband alone even though it is the homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.148" offset="17875989">And the wife and children live in the home, the husband is free to alienate that property and he cannot be forbidden from the wife in doing so or he cannot be call upon to account to the wife after he has done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.705" offset="17938160">So, I say to the Court that because of this great power of control and because of the very effects that would flow from the hypothetical which we have inserted in our brief, which I think is a good analysis and a sound analysis or an analogy excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.461" offset="18009213">I think the Government has admitted that the effect of their position would be that where the husband earns his money, squanders it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4548.781" offset="18298546">The Government would have you extend that to mean that because she has that sufficient vested interest, she therefore we just all look her rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="4676.716" offset="18810232">That under Louisiana law, if a husband and wife both signed that same note to the finance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.098" offset="18835728">In other words, the wife has not joined in signing that note, under Louisiana law; she has voluntarily then obligated herself personally to pay the debt so that then her separate property can be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.068" offset="18887659">But the point is that the husband can actually endanger the community, all of the wife’s interest in the community when he signs that note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.443" offset="18921096">And it’s under that condition and we say that the law has provided for the wife to renounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.166" offset="18944084">And Your Honor, the only have a point I want to make for the Court is that the Government’s characterization of what I have called the wife’s separate property is immunity if you will from vulnerability to seizure by the Government for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.946" offset="19015137">That has been characterized by the Government as a state exemption statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.705" offset="19030183">The way you would exempt for instance insurance proceeds under law or the way you might exempt the tools of trade from seizure that type of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4742.929" offset="19075114">This is an integral part of our community property system which flows logically from the others that since the wife can renounce and since she doesn’t have control, therefore her separate property cannot be seized by a community creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.508" offset="19137390">And I say to the Court that that is not merely an exemption statute that the federal law preempts more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.720" offset="19162258">It is an integral part of our community property system which I believe would have to be respected in determining what her rights are for the imposition of federal income tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="4960.604" offset="19945827">I would like to respond to four or five items brought out in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.152" offset="19964008">First, it’s our position that the federal statute at this point in time is very clear that it taxes income to the owner and that this is been the law since this Court handed down its decisions in the 1930 term in split income cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.168" offset="20032031">Thus, the inquiry under state law is who is the owner and we think the law of Louisiana is equally clear that the wife owns her one-half share of the income and thus it follows that she must report and pay the taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.187" offset="20092113">The taxpayer’s arguments essentially are that the various state law rights to which they refer so qualify the wife’s ownership that she can’t be obligated to pay the tax that the ownership does not rise to the level which the federal statutes tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.954" offset="20179153">Listening to that argument, it duplicates almost verbatim of the Government’s brief in the Poe versus Seaborn cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.555" offset="20213635">All of these arguments were made by the Government in the 1930 cases in support of their position that the husband must report and pay taxes on all of the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.821" offset="20258670">We argued there that he was the in fact owner of all the income because of his practical powers, management powers albeit over that income and of course not only did we argue his management powers but we also pointed to the wife’s protections under state law, specifically her renunciation power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.671" offset="20342053">And we argued in our brief that this renunciation power was inconsistent with the wife being a sufficient “owner” to entitle her separately to report and pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.190" offset="20396178">Notwithstanding our arguments, the court very clearly held and this contrary to the assertions of respondents that the income is tax to the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.628" offset="20433899">It did not tax it to the community as an entity but rather to the owner and found that individual spouses each of them owned their respective shares of the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.311" offset="20480606">This was the very clear holding not only in Poe versus Seaborn, the Washington case but also in the Louisiana case where the court said, if the test to be as we have held that it is ownership then the Louisiana case is probably the strongest of those presented to us in favor of the wife’s ownership of one-half of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.887" offset="20570885">It went on of course to hold that because she was the owner, she was entitled separately to report it and pay taxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.929" offset="20603068">The wife indeed has protections under state law but these protections do not affect her basic ownership right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.651" offset="20633997">They are outlined in the Weiner opinion to which we refer on page 10 of our brief in support of the court’s decision there, the Louisiana Supreme Court’s decision there showing that the husband’s management powers are not so extensive as to destroy the wife’s ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.609" offset="20705782">These protections indeed limit the husband’s powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.172" offset="20724067">The husband not only has these rights with respect to management but has a duty to manage the community property for the benefit of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.799" offset="20754578">So that duties go along with the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.341" offset="20768684">I might add that the provision of Louisiana law dealing with separation of property without dissolving a marriage, provide not only for the separation of property where the wife’s, I beg your pardon -- where the husband’s activities endanger the wife’s separate property but go on to say or win the disorder of his affairs induces her to believe that his estate may not be sufficient to meet her rights and claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.811" offset="20874637">And of course it’s our position that one of her rights and claims would be the right to receive her share of community property upon dissolution of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.609" offset="20909850">And thus, if the husband was furthering away the community income, obviously this would be -- entitle her to a separation of property under Louisiana Civil Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.166" offset="20960005">With respect to the right of renunciation, let me say that this of course occurs only after the community is dissolved and as in the cases here long after the tax years in which income is realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.071" offset="21023640">At the very moment, the income is realized and this is the clear law of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.982" offset="21043284">The wife owns her share of that income, it would certainly be an unusual and in fact unique in the tax law if many years later because of some act she took with respect to the state’s definition of creditor’s rights she could remove the liability which otherwise is imposed on her by the Federal Taxing Statutes for her tax on her share of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.608" offset="21149759">Now, let me emphasize too that the decision below opens up also many non-hardship cases or at least it poses a problem in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.512" offset="21193435">Under that decision, there is nothing to keep why is now from just not reporting their share of income and to the husband filing a separate return and paying the tax on his half of the community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.336" offset="21256756">Under the decisions of this Court and we think Malcolm in contrast to our respondents is quite clear that we cannot collect the wife’s taxes from the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.330" offset="21308688">Thus, the taxes on her share would escape taxation under the decision below.</text>
