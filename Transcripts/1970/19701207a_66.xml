            <label>Mr. Ramsey Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="36.933" offset="251068">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.680" offset="262144">This is a defamation suit brought under the laws to the State of Pennsylvania in the United Stated District Court, jurisdiction being on its diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.290" offset="312508">Before stating the facts, let me state the question briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.202" offset="340198">New York Times v. Sullivan of course began to apply the First Amendment to the laws of defamation and libel which had interfered historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.840" offset="398712">It began in that area of conduct of public officials engaging in official conduct and said that “Only where an actual malice can be shown, can the state statutes permitting recovery for defamation applied” otherwise there’ll be a chilling effect, there will not be adequate breathing room for freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.460" offset="497246">The question here is whether that rule is to be extended to the very private individual to the 200 million Americans who are not famous, who are not public officials, and who are not public figures such as Coach Butch or General Edwin Walker, who are just plain people engaging in ordinary life.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.829" offset="606647">This petitioner, George A. Rosenbloom, was a successful salesman for the major magazine and book distributor in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.053" offset="655548">In that capacity in 1962, he was offered a major distributorship for American Outdoor Publishing Corporation which publishes nudist magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.449" offset="705181">He carefully considered because he was a man concerned, as the record shows about his reputation, whether to take this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.122" offset="735901">He even consulted a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.517" offset="745409">He was advised that the Supreme Court of the United States had held that these publications were legal and after many months on the first of May, he accepted the distributorship and became the distributor in the Philadelphia area for this publishing company.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.251" offset="808417">Well, Mr. Clark you’re putting an emphasis on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.099" offset="823777">I’m not quite sure I follow it.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.100" offset="887724">The emphasis arises from what I believe is the constitutional and certainly the national concern for reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.851" offset="914787">Here was a man that was concerned about his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.259" offset="924400">This is a defamation action, and as the facts were disclosed, a jury found he was defamed and he was a man who was cautious enough before getting into this business to be sure that it was a proper business, a legal business and it happened to be a business that the Supreme Court of the United States itself had reviewed and upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.886" offset="1002872">On October the 1st --</text>

            <text syncTime="225.709" offset="1006216">It goes to the falsity of the defamation, ultimately doesn’t it, the fact that he consulted a lawyer and that he to be sure he was carrying on a law abiding business?</text>

            <text syncTime="236.770" offset="1050415">It certainly bears on that, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.446" offset="1057207">It bears also on his care for his reputation too, which I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.202" offset="1084165">On the 1st of October in 1963, there were series of raids on newsstands in the City of Philadelphia by the city police.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.866" offset="1122826">On that day, approximately 20 newsstands employees were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.373" offset="1148844">This petitioner, George Rosenbloom who happened to be making a delivery of his magazines at one at the time was also arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.709" offset="1178206">And on October the 4th of 1963, there begun a series of more than 21 broadcast in which this respondent here referred to him in his business, this first broadcast which came over the air at 6 pm on October the 4th begun city cracks down on smut merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.591" offset="1273710">There had been 7 or 8 arrests on October the 4th and on that day the WIP, the Metromedia Station Philadelphia now says Mr. Rosenbloom’s home had been raided.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.210" offset="1320208">They gave his whole name and his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.135" offset="1327940">They referred to no other one else arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.838" offset="1338702">They stated they had been confiscated at his home 1000 magazines and that he had been arrested on the charge of possession of obscene literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.243" offset="1372348">In addition, it stated that a barn that he rented had been raided, and there were confiscated obscene books.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.131" offset="1403904">It did not say allegedly obscene books, it said obscene books.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.593" offset="1421772">It said too that Captain Ferguson who was in charge of special investigating unit in the City of Philadelphia at that time believed the police had hit the supply of the main distributor of obscene material in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.636" offset="1481958">The second -- they were broadcast through that night through the next day that repeated generally this.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.094" offset="1503796">The word allegedly obscene books was added in some subsequent broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.162" offset="1532008">A second series of broadcast begun on October 21st, repeated in variations on the 25th and on November the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.918" offset="1571088">These addressed themselves to a lawsuit that the petitioner here had filed to enjoin the Police Department and the newspaper and radio station in Philadelphia from harassment interfering with his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.663" offset="1626049">It did not endeavor to enjoin generally their conduct, but only insofar as he was concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.045" offset="1715597">This damage suit filed later and came up before the same judge, Judge Joseph Lord III in the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.984" offset="1751333">The broadcast characterized plaintiffs as smut distributors, girly book peddlers and as attempting to the force -- to force the defendants, which included the Chief of Police and the newspapers and radio stations to lay off the smut literature racket.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.426" offset="1825102">Mr. Clark, if the word obscene without the adjective alleged, or allegedly obscene had not been in the case if they just said he was a peddler of girly magazines, etcetera, what would be your view of his claim now?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ramsey Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="451.050" offset="1907545">Well, I think the characterization by its choice, by the radio station of these materials as obscene is certainly a major element, but there many other elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.413" offset="1949027">I think to have relied upon the Captain of Police who had phoned this in under the impression that he had some duty to inform the public. In other words, in contrast to Sullivan v. New York Times, here you have Sullivan calling New York Times and giving them a story about some fellow out in the street, and as the fellow out in the street in this situation who is not known to anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.892" offset="2042964">But what I was trying to get at was, would you regard that this libel as if they said that he was a peddler of girly magazines?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ramsey Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="493.299" offset="2076609">I think I would agree with Judge Lord that the editorialization and the sensational way in which they characterized his conduct would be defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.371" offset="2120808">I think it would diminish him in the eyes of his fellow man, and I think it would damage his business as certainly this damaged his business very severely.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.945" offset="2163127">He lost 34 out of 60 accounts that he’d been able to build up, and he went out of business in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.779" offset="2194474">The other things that were said that would add to that of course, that he was the main distributor of obscene material in Philadelphia, and I was relying on Captain Ferguson perhaps, but do they really have a right to rely upon him without any examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.497" offset="2245360">Is this going to protect free speech, or is it really going to interfere with free speech when the police use the press as an extension of their enforcement arm, or vice versa?</text>

            <text syncTime="733.940" offset="3039169">The jury charge said that there be four elements in the proof of defamation for general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.690" offset="3074173">First that there was harm to the reputation of the plaintiff that it lowered him in the estimation of his peers and that it deterred third persons from engaging in commerce with him. Second that the allegations that were made could reasonably be taken to refer to the plaintiff while his name and his address given in this case.</text>
