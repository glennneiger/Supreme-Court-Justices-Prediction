            <text syncTime="59.263" offset="340407">He was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.105" offset="359842">I observed that it was a conscientious objector, however, that claim has never been passed upon by his local board and the reason for that is he did not become a conscientious objector until after he received his notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.274" offset="424417">He couldn’t apply for the status before he was conscientious objector and at the time he became a conscientious objector, according to the local board, it no longer had jurisdiction to review his claim and that the Government contends is correct reading of the selective service regulations and the selective service law so that an objector such as Ehlert can never have his claim heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.075" offset="531623">We think the Government’s risk misreading the regulation because there is a regulation that provides for reopening of classifications, reconsiderations by the local board, if after an order of Court for induction has been mailed, there has been a change in the registrant’s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.204" offset="628172">We contend that that regulation is applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.058" offset="687626">When that moment arrives, when he decides that he can do nothing else but not participate in war, when that moment comes, its crystallization is the circumstance over which he has no control and which --</text>

            <text syncTime="179.402" offset="820955">The cases to which I refer all say that the reopening occurs under 1625.2 and that language in that regulation is that you have a reopening if there were circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.480" offset="881246">The theory of the majority below in the Ninth Circuit here that one does have control over his conscience and for that reason the registrant wouldn’t come within the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.973" offset="927222">I don’t think the Government is currently, at least not being enthusiastically supporting that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.082" offset="959718">The Government seems to say now that this isn’t a circumstance within the meaning of the statute, they cite no authority for that and they seem to claim that a circumstance has to be some sort of external event that’s verifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.657" offset="1030040">I think that -- confused with the circumstances within the meaning of the regulation, the circumstance I assume the regulation means its approximate circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.978" offset="1063267">That is to say, if when after he receives a notice to report for induction, should be struck by an automobile have a leg broken, the circumstance that results in the reopening is not being struck by an automobile but having a broken leg.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.038" offset="1171519">Another analogy might be since the Government seems to be saying that has to the event that’s externally verifiable should a man after receiving an order to report for induction become mentally incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.146" offset="1235989">I think we would say that there had been a circumstance for which he had no control which should intervene and which required reclassification.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.942" offset="1503169">And the question is here whether a status of conscientious objection which my hypothesis crystallized or occurred after the induction notice falls under the one category or the other, is that what this case is about?</text>

            <text syncTime="486.789" offset="2050487">At least we have that facially in his application, he’s made a prima facie case that he had late crystallization that was conscientious objector I believe and additionally has made a prima facie case that he is a conscientious objector, and in that situation we contend there should be a reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.992" offset="2115375">And that we just point out to emphasize additionally that if the regulation isn’t read that way, there is no form for this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.149" offset="2151946">The Government at certain points in the brief seems to suggest that he’s been dilatory but this isn’t just a late claim, this is a late maturing claim, he couldn’t have made the claim before he received the order to report for induction because he was not to his conscience and his mind the conscientious objector at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.916" offset="4959065">Even though the application had been made before if its determined that the selective service induction center that the man isn’t physically fit, if there’s been a change, he’s taken out of the -- he is given a one Y or four F and he’s not inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.379" offset="5076929">But anyway, I was saying that I don’t think that our construction at all produces any problems as far as the efficiency of the selective service system that the construction that we seek in this regulation would result the Selective Service System doing what its job is and not having conscientious objectors in jails where none of the purposes of penology are served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.310" offset="5180583">And on the other side, the construction that we seek provides nothing but a forum for those who have late maturing claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.350" offset="5408789">There’s no reason to think that the conscientious objector shouldn’t be reopened, the congressional history is clear that a conscientious objector is supposed to be given the same sort of treatment as every other person exempted or deferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.088" offset="5935731">Let me advert very briefly to the facts as they appear to the Government to bear on the appropriate decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.824" offset="5970631">On July 24, 1961, the petitioner registered for the draft because he reached age 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.967" offset="5999261">On January 17, 1964, the petitioner returned his classification questionnaire to the local board making no assertion of claim to conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.165" offset="6043982">On April 15, 1964, petitioner was ordered to report for a physical examination on May 26, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.904" offset="6082957">In June 16, 1965, the petitioner’s induction notice was mailed to him directing him to report for induction on July 14, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.423" offset="6129037">One day before the date scheduled for his induction, on July 13, 1965, the petitioner mailed a letter to his local draft board asserting that he was a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.898" offset="6182954">The petitioner was tried for violation of the applicable statute convicted by the District Court and the judgment was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in a split of eight to five in that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.678" offset="6234049">The questions raised by the petitioner go to the proper interpretation of the regulation whether the regulation as interpreted by the court below was consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.181" offset="6288071">The regulation as is set forth in the briefs, the critical language is that reclassification after mailing of induction notice is cut off in all cases unless it is based on a claim of “change in the registrant’s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant has no control, and the regulation as construed by the court below is designed to exclude all post notice of induction claims subject only to a very narrow exception and the exception is -- requires two facets, one must meet both facets to come within the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.252" offset="6480332">The first is that it be a non-volitional change and the second is that it be a change resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.222" offset="6540309">Now, there were two opinion, three opinions in the court below agreeing with the result of affirmance of the conviction. Judge Kilkenny writing the court’s majority opinion stressed the volitional nature of a change in conscientious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.236" offset="6604361">Judge Donahue with the concurrence of three of the other judges of the panel who also concurred with Judge Kilkenny stressed the common sense in dictionary definition of the word circumstances in the context used in the regulation concluding that as used the term referred to some event external or extraneous to the registrant and therefore that it was unnecessary to engage in the debate that had gone on between the other circuits which had considered this matter as to whether a change in conscience was volitional or not since regardless of that, such a change was not a circumstance as used in those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.477" offset="6777292">Both Judge Kilkenny and Judge Donahue relied also on the serious practical consequences of a contrary construction as expounded by Judge Merrill for the dissenters in reaching the result that they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.352" offset="8060740">One may go to school, one may enter the ministry, one may become a teacher, these are barred and there has been no suggestion in any Court that’s considered the point that they may not be barred post induction notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.710" offset="8114239">So, the unifying theme of the regulation is the notion that not only is volitional move to obtain exemption totally cut off with the mailing of the induction notice but that only those non-volitional types of claims which are capable of ready verification by the local board consisting as it does of laymen meeting irregularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.575" offset="8225625">The sole surviving son exemption, a brother shot down in a plane of something like that that can be verified with a letter or a phone call is something that can clearly be disposed off by the board one way or the other between the time of notice of induction and the time of reporting for induction which is near as I can tell from these cases seems to have run during this period of time of -- from between three and four weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.661" offset="8342026">A claim to a change in ones conscience, a change in conscientious status requiring as it does both the ascertainment of a present state of mind and a determination of whether or not that is a change of the state of mind one held prior to induction is a factual and of extraordinary difficulty and even had this petitioner mailed his claim the day after he received his induction notice, a local board would have had great difficulty passing on it, prior to the time of induction deciding it one way or the other and certainly when he mails it on the day before he is scheduled to report for induction, he assures the absolute impossibility of the board being able to pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.028" offset="8531466">In short, he assures himself regardless of the merits of his claim, regardless of the merits of his conscientious objector claim or of his claim to a change of mind of getting a postponement in the date set for induction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.569" offset="9161644">I think this claim proves too much and would cite at least two points in support of that observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.993" offset="9191320">There is no expressed statutory authority in 6 (j) for barring the assertion of conscientious objector claims which have existed previous to induction notice but haven’t been asserted and yet even the Court’s which have gone the Gearey route have said that this is a proper function of the regulation that the man who was always a conscientious objector but fails to assert it until the time he receives the induction notice can validly be barred and yet there’s no statutory authority for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.865" offset="9322872">It’s simply the application of a procedural rule that is fairly designed to both permit reasonable processing of these claims and to effectuate a necessary ultimate cut off date and change it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.709" offset="9498206">Perhaps waiver because it is -- you know, something that every lawyer responds to almost instinctively with an affirmative notion, maybe waiver is different but I don’t think it that -- it’s completely different and I think the type of procedural thing we’re talking about here is by no means completely distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.616" offset="9593814">The same Section 6 (j) of the Act that confers the right of conscientious objector exemption also confers in unqualified terms a right of appeal and although this precise language is this, “Any person claiming exemption from combatant training and service because of such conscientious objection shall if such claim is not sustained by the local board, be entitled to an appeal to the appropriate appeal board”, and yet I suspect even petitioner wouldn’t contend that the president under his general authority to promulgate rules isn’t entitled to set some time limit as within which an appeal from an adverse decision of a local board must be taken to the appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.518" offset="9793494">Surely, on the day before you need to report for the induction, you can’t come in and say, “Well, I’ve decided to appeal to the appeal board from the local board’s adverse ruling two years ago, that I wasn’t a conscientious objector.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.038" offset="9851486">So, it simply is an overly simplistic to use an overly used word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.980" offset="9883251">Construction of the statute to say that because it confers a right of conscientious objection, there may be no procedural regulations governing how that right is to be set forth or how it is to be processed, and as occurred earlier in the colloquy between counsel and I believe Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.008" offset="9975411">If you parse the sections sentence by sentence, the only unqualified right conferred, even if you take a literal reading is the right to be exempt from combatant training and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.537" offset="10033507">The right to be exempt from induction is conferred only upon those who are found by their local boards to be conscientious objectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.336" offset="10068720">I don’t think you can read either one of those statutes’ sense as literally to the exclusion of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.703" offset="10094216">I think that the overall result that you get from a fair reading of the section is that there is a substantive right of conscientious objection and that reasonable rules are permissible so long as they serve a legitimate and to the Selective Service System and its administration and don’t unreasonably restrict the right of the conscientious objector claimant to assert his claim in that forum.</text>
