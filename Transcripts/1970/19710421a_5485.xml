            <text syncTime="17.991" offset="175313">My name is Stephen Porter of the law firm Williams &amp; Connolly, seated in counsel table is Richard Rugo of the law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.376" offset="204884">We are co-counsel for petitioner in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.830" offset="218676">This case arises out of the conviction and sentencing of a Mississippi civil rights worker under circumstances which would appear to ignore every pronouncement and every limitation and every cautionary statement that this Court has over the years ever made on the issue of the use by a trial court of the power, without the ordinary requirements of due process to punish allegedly contumacious behavior summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.994" offset="327346">The salient facts briefly reviewed are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.877" offset="342915">On January 27, 1969, petitioner Robert Johnson was summarily convicted by Grenada County, Mississippi Circuit Court Judge Marshall Perry for a remarked allegedly made in Judge Perry’s Court more than two years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.078" offset="403728">Judge Perry sentenced petitioner for four months in jail although the maximum sentence is one month to which the Supreme Court of Mississippi later reduced the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.479" offset="441240">The conviction resulted from an incident which occurred on January 24, 1967 in the judge’s courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.205" offset="464227">At 9 A.M. that morning, prospective jurors of the January term occupied benches near courtroom doors, a section normally reserved for the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.883" offset="566941">Judge Perry announced that anyone entering the Court while in session would be required to use an aisle in the rear and this announcement was made approximately five or ten minutes before Robert Johnson appeared in Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.634" offset="7865866">I don’t know what the aspects the usual contempt in Mississippi is unique, and I didn’t have the time to research it from other states with this tremendous task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.237" offset="7904319">But I agree thoroughly with the rationale of Mayberry and other similar cases that if summary punishment is not immediately imposed at that judge ought to get some other judge to hear the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.192" offset="7972133">Hear the evidence and defend on whether or not, first, it is contempt and what the penalty ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.705" offset="7994180">Some judges are unstrung by the contemptuous conduct or unbiased, unprejudiced, and unattached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.160" offset="8035976">But I suggest this, I mean I have been through the court, I felt it like a sort of thin ice in this case for a while and I tried to get counsel to agree, in spite of the fact I think Rule 37, being find on submissive through that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.765" offset="8098461">I tried to get them to agree to submit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.307" offset="8112567">But instead in the thing and the statute on appeals from contempt convictions, I found an interesting thing I've pointed out in my virtual brief that that statute accomplishes, I think to greater degree what would be accomplished by having one single judge hear this thing at a later date when summary punishment not imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.509" offset="8225416">That statute on appeal from contempt conviction provides that the Supreme Court of Mississippi, nine judges will review the thing on a record and decide one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.401" offset="8268988">Was there a contempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.824" offset="8282676">Then, if they determined that there was a contempt from that cold printed record uninfluenced by courtroom atmosphere and what not they can do one of four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.643" offset="8333981">At the time when the statute said, whether the appellant was guilty of contempt and the sentence or decree or order of the court below maybe affirmed, reversed, annulled or modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.210" offset="8388211">According to the judgment of the appellate court, that of course was a reason I have attested Boston opinion as an appendix to the brief, to show just how our State Supreme Court has handled these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.891" offset="8450905">Now, there was a case where the same Judge Perry found a man in Boston who was a lawyer on Winston County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.906" offset="8482983">They ran against Judge Perry, the Circuit judge in contempt and they appealed to their Supreme Court and they completely annulled the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.482" offset="8521331">They didn’t reverse, remand, vacate, or modify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.514" offset="8533452">They completely annulled it as you see from that appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.663" offset="8594056">About your argument as to the Mississippi statute that gives the Supreme Court reviewing power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.447" offset="8725191">And secondly, since there was no hearing, there really wasn’t anything to review in this case if they took the findings in the trial court's judgment as true and correct.</text>
