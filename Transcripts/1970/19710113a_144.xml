            <text syncTime="69.683" offset="385170">This case involves a racially motivated assault on a public highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.514" offset="416517">It presents questions as to the reach and the constitutionality of the civil provision of Section 2 of the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act now in Section 1985 (3) of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.689" offset="493213">The particular terms that the case focuses on that statute read and they’re quoted at page 3 of the petitioner’s White brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.965" offset="534277">If two or more persons conspire for the purpose of depriving either directly or indirectly any person or class of persons of the Equal Protection of the laws or the of equal privileges and immunities under the laws and whether is injury or a deprivation, a civil cause for damages is created.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.491" offset="660396">The particular issues as we see them are two, whether this Section 1985 (3) reaches a conspiracy of private citizens to prevent persons and class of persons on account of their race from seeking equal protection of the laws and from enjoying equal rights, privileges and immunities under federal and state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.273" offset="795502">Now, if the statute reads, as we believe an urge that it be read then the Court has before it a question of power whether Section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act was within the powers of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.314" offset="875750">Let me state briefly the facts which arise on demur as the District Court dismissed the petitioner’s complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.547" offset="1296635">The purpose of the conspiracy was to deprive the petitioners of exercise and enjoyment of equal rights, equal privileges and immunities under Mississippi laws and under the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.979" offset="1382316">The conspiracy was carried out, the Breckenridges using guns, clubs proceeded to threaten and beat the riders in the car and with injuries and thereby so the complaint alleges depriving them of rights including rights to travel on federal highways, rights to petition, rights to movement and a series of rights set forth particularly in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.936" offset="1530169">The District Court dismissed the case, the claim on a motion on grounds that there was no allegation that the action was other than by purely private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.118" offset="1594953">The Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.651" offset="1617000">It did so in its words reluctantly feeling bound by the decision of this Court in Collins v. Hardyman and the opinion of Judge Goldberg states that the Court would not be surprised if Collins were disapproved and Section 1985 (3) were held to embrace private conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.356" offset="1715848">In our argument before Your Honors, we urge first that Section 1985 be given the scope which we see in its words and its legislative history to reach purely private conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.459" offset="1788259">The persons not acting under color of law aimed at depriving others of rights afforded by federal and state citizenship, where the conspiracy and the deprivation has a purpose because of the membership of those victims in a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.907" offset="1870075">Here, the class is the racial class.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.105" offset="1882823">It’s a racial conspiracy to deprive these Negroes and other Negroes of the exercise of the rights afforded them by federal and state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.518" offset="2044468">Now, we would not -- we’re confronted here with a race case and the Court has indicated that it will decide constitutional questions on the facts of the particular case but we would not say to the Court that there could not be a class beyond race, where it is a definable class.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.158" offset="2279048">The only statement that the record shows is that the Breckenridge’s had a mistaken belief that Grady was a civil rights worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.154" offset="2311022">The record before the court does state that these particular Negroes and other Negro Americans were deprived of the exercise of rights, were intimidated from the exercise of a matter of rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.402" offset="2408093">It was occurred at approximately that a month after the Meredith March where we know those were times of the tension and movement, freedom of movement indeed was the purpose of the Meredith March.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.119" offset="2470891">The objective of an individual of the Negro race being able to walk from Memphis to Jackson without fear and we know what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.174" offset="2523136">But we would see 1985 (3) has formed by the Congress in 1871 at the time, when it was concerned with private action developing conspiracies which had as their objective, the limitation of newly won rights and exercise and enjoyment of newly won rights by the recently freed Negro slaves and that that purpose finds expression in 1985 and would find this case right at the heart of the concern of the Congress in drafting the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.758" offset="3845454">The first issue that we considered the Court has before it is what the Congress intended to reach in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.643" offset="3885056">This is the position, the Court took in Collins that the Congress intended to reach or in fact did reach only conspiracies under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.662" offset="3949108">Now, we think the legislative history, the words and indeed the positions taken by this Court are in the way of the decision of the Court, the reading of the statute in the Collins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.591" offset="4024759">Congress in the 1866, 1870 and 1871 statutes as this Court has just been reviewing in the Dickey case and then the Arizona v. United States case, Congress knew well, how to distinguish between actions under color of law and purely private actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.743" offset="4117441">It did so in the various sections of the 1866 Act, it did so in the 1870 Act and it did so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.864" offset="4153908">And in this 1871 Act, Section 1 of the Act, a civil section which is now 1983, Congress used the words under color of law and in Section 2, Congress omitted those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.733" offset="4233425">We think that it’s clear from its use of the words and from the background legislative history that it drew Section 1 to reach actions of a single person under color of law which denied rights and that Section 2 was drawn to reach purely private conspiracies which had as their objective, the deprivation of equal rights and equal privileges and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.927" offset="4358186">And we believe that the Court -- we believe that the Congress is sensitive to the questions which were part of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.598" offset="4408863">Mr. Justice White raises that the Congress included the word equal with the sensitivity that what it was concerned with, what it directed the statute to reach was group conduct, a conspiracy which was aimed at denying a class of persons because of the membership in the class of the equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.114" offset="4514920">The Congressman who introduced the amendment that added the equal, Congressman Shellabarger explained this use of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.352" offset="4559851">And we think his words have meaning and understanding the reach of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.635" offset="4580958">He said the objective of the amendment is to confine the authority of the law to prevention of deprivations which shall attack the equality of rights of American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.826" offset="4637800">That any violation of the right, the animus and effective which is to strike down the citizen, to the end that he may not enjoy equality of the rights has contrasted with his and other citizens rights shall be within the scope of the remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.015" offset="4734454">I don’t know that I need dwell on the reach of the statute to purely private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.425" offset="4760158">The Court rather directly after the 1871 Act in the Harris case read the statute as reaching purely private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.226" offset="4803312">Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart in their concurrence in Monroe v. Pape in 1961 gave it that reading, in Dcikey just six months ago, Mr. Justice Harlan makes a similar expression in two footnotes, Mr. Justice Brennan in concurrence and partial dissent states that he believes Collins is no longer but law and that the reach of the statute to purely private actions is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.793" offset="4933611">And similar decisions of this Court with respect to the language of Section 241 of the criminal statutes would recognize and does recognize the words if two or more persons conspire as reaching purely private action.</text>
