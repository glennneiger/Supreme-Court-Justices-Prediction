            <text syncTime="76.636" offset="409893">Section 34 of the Georgia Code is the Georgia Election Code, and I think for convenience sake, I will just refer to the individual Sections as for example, Section 1010.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.932" offset="1347062">Well, the 5% here comes out to slightly less than the 15% in Ohio. It comes out to about 10% by the Ohio standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.266" offset="1560430">And it seems that they were pretty well able to isolate out the number of signatures required and strike that down on its own rather than as part of an entangling web, as the court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.226" offset="1636289">When I say that the candidates here are candidates of the Georgia Socialist Workers Party, I should point out that the Georgia Socialist Workers Party is a political body according to the laws of Georgia which means two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.691" offset="1710164">It means first that its candidates failed to receive 20% of the votes, the last time the office of Governor was contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.039" offset="1759483">And it means that its candidates failed to receive 20% of the nationwide vote for President.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.960" offset="1787173">But it also means one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.393" offset="1792920">It means that the party is registered with the office of the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 901 of the Election Code, which basically requires the party to go through the same procedures that a corporation would to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.783" offset="1882467">It has to file its bylaws, submit the names of its officers and any other information, the Secretary may in fact desire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.446" offset="6857122">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.025" offset="6879483">Mrs. Jenness’s argument would take on the nominating petition laws is based on two different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.780" offset="6918457">First ground is that she claims there’s a denial of equal protection rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.738" offset="6946356">The second ground is that she claims these laws violate her right to freedom of association, as has been recognized by this Court in Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.600" offset="7005811">We shall characterize the equal protection argument as the “grass is always greener on the other side” argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.082" offset="7035695">In Georgia, this has been noted by this Court, there is not this tremendous imbalance between the two paths or methods to get on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.944" offset="7083133">In Williams, we had all the additional burdens that were placed upon third party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.007" offset="7119391">Ohio completely eliminated independent candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.185" offset="7136110">In Georgia, except for the actual vehicle itself; that is the petition method as opposed to the primary method, there is not this imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.848" offset="7174771">As a matter of fact, as a result of the three-judge-court decision below, if you go the petition method and you can allege poverty, you do not have to pay any qualifying fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.946" offset="7227120">We therefore think this lawsuit is bottom on an incorrect assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.928" offset="7251048">The assumption that’s incorrect is that a primary method is easier than a petition method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.447" offset="7281142">We believe that if anyone went through both of these methods, he would seriously question this assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.319" offset="7308622">Now Mrs. Jenness sees a primary as a method whereby a candidate merely sits at home and waits for the votes to come to his door and he’s automatically nominated and authorized to go on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.453" offset="7369226">In fact that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.826" offset="7378631">A primary candidate has to expend tremendous amounts of energy, his own resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.879" offset="7406843">He has organizational problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.125" offset="7415829">The complexities of a campaign particularly for the gubernatorial nomination in Georgia are simply not recognized by Mrs. Jenness when she sees this imbalance between the two methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.623" offset="7469850">Further, if a general primary candidate is defeated, he never has a chance to get to the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.734" offset="7502346">Whereas, with a person who’s going to petition method, once they obtained the required petition, there is no problem with going on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.685" offset="7534111">They are automatically certified and they on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.694" offset="7558144">Therefore, we believe that while the grass may seem greener to Mrs. Jenness in actual fact, close and a realistic examination of the two methods to get on the general election ballot in Georgia will show that there is no inequality and her claim on this basis must fail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.063" offset="10051584">Yes sir, because the second ground on which these nominating petition laws are challenged are that they violate this freedom of association right that has been recognized by the Court in Williams versus Rhode.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.695" offset="10102157">Of course, Williams’ case is the touchstone case in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.442" offset="10121174">We hope that this Court can see the differences between Georgia’s laws and Ohio’s laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.544" offset="10149595">This Court several time in its opinion in Williams stressed this entangling web, the totality of the Ohio structure that made it impossible for third parties to get on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.936" offset="10203094">We believe that we have shown that Georgia has only the actual vehicle itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.667" offset="10230053">That’s the only difference that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.202" offset="10240188">Now, we would like also to stress to the Court that this law is not an absolute bar to appearing on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.655" offset="10274043">It maybe treated by some as the bar, but it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.264" offset="10288462">We have indicated before numerous candidates both statewide candidates and local candidates have gained access to the general election ballot through the petition method.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.687" offset="10390131">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.613" offset="10393788">Two most noteworthy examples statewide are of course, George Wallace and before him Howard Bo Callaway, the candidate for governor who received the plurality but did not receive the majority, and this Court decided Fortson versus Morris that the legislature could go ahead and elect and elected his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.031" offset="10471528">And Mrs. Jenness has argued that it is an absolute bar to her because she simply can’t meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.118" offset="10503816">Well, we would first say to this Court that there’s nothing in this record to show that she or anyone in her class has ever tried to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.175" offset="10544044">We don’t know what kind of effort would be required because they’ve never tried, or at least the record doesn’t show that they ever tried to go out and gather signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.191" offset="10588139">Now we will admit that some expenditure of effort is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.527" offset="10605484">However, as we have indicated before, expenditure of effort is also needed to win a primary and we believe that before you can gain access to the general election ballot, the state does have a right to require this showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.420" offset="10669014">We also would point out to the Court that the court decision below had removed the qualifying fee from paupers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.896" offset="10714990">As this Court also indicated previously, the nominating petition law does not impinge in any way on the right of Mrs. Jenness to meet with others or for choice, the whole public meetings to advocate any idea, to solicit members to her group, or short to do anything else to gain access to the minds of her fellow citizens and to seek to persuade them to her political point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.855" offset="10818748">Now, as I had indicated, 49 states have nominating petition laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.092" offset="10847692">Again, some are higher, most are lower, some the same as Georgia’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.353" offset="10872769">However, as we’ve indicated, these other restrictions we think can at least point out to this Court why although Georgia on its face may be higher than some of the states, perhaps majority of the states that you can’t just judge nominating petition laws on the number of signatures required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.049" offset="10959600">You need to go deeper into the Election Code into the election scheme if you’re going to make a comparison of Georgia with the other states in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.571" offset="11009651">We would stress to this Court that Election Codes are not static instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.134" offset="11035878">They are continuously being revised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.765" offset="11046431">They’re under study by the legislature, at private citizens groups, by interested people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.316" offset="11072658">We would ask this Court to authorize the use of nominating petitions by the 49 states who’d depend on them to help their election laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.542" offset="11109543">The national movement and election laws today is to make it easier to vote, get people to the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.410" offset="11137024">We believe that the petition law has a valid requirement and has -- the state has an interest in upholding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.610" offset="11161788">We would ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the three-judge-court below and authorize its use.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.591" offset="11281742">First one when my opponent says that the 1943 laws were less restrictive than the 1922 laws, he is just plain incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.245" offset="11332315">In 1922 and the Election Code found in the 1922 session laws at page 100, it states very clearly that the names of candidates of each political party and also the names of any other candidates for the offices to be filled are to be placed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.669" offset="11430013">And it further provides that all candidates for national and state offices or the proper authorities of the political party nominating them shall file notice of their candidacy, giving their names in the offices for which they are candidates with the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.235" offset="11512351">So the 1943 move from no petition requirements to 5% was in fact more restrictive up until that time anyone could get on the ballot simply by filing a notice of candidacy with the Secretary of State.</text>
