            <text syncTime="29.031" offset="219512">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.432" offset="241142">The board issued its order directing the respondent utility district to bargain collectively with the union which a -- the voice of the district in an appropriate unit had previously designated as her bargain representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.770" offset="306448">The district contending that under the laws of the State of Tennessee that it is a political subdivision for an arm or instrumentality of the state has refused to comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.783" offset="358484">The statute specifically excludes from the definition of the term employer, the United States or any state, or any critical subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.323" offset="416684">The two questions presented here are first, whether for purposes of the Labor Act, federal standards or state law governs the determination whether an entity is a political subdivision within the meaning of the statute or an employer within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.302" offset="488573">Secondly, if federal standards and not state law govern that determination whether boards find it that the district here is not a political subdivision within the meaning of the Labor Act but an employer is entitled to affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.095" offset="551790">The court below rejecting the board’s view held that state law is controlling with the respect of the determination of whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and on the basis of the state, the code of the State of Tennessee and the Supreme Court’s -- and the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee confirming the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.959" offset="651160">It held that the district here was a political subdivision within the meaning of the Labor Act and therefore not an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.121" offset="799848">Yes, eminent domain is not a unique characteristic of political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.320" offset="828688">Private concerns quasi-public you might say have been given that sort of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.032" offset="863483">Now, I want to summarize perhaps a little bit more at length than I normally as the case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.425" offset="893053">I do want to summarize one of the facts, custodian facts that relate to the district’s status as an employer under the act or as the other side would have it as a political subdivision under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.862" offset="938820">The district sells and distributes natural gas without profit to residential homes, commercial businesses and industrial firms in Hopkins County, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.429" offset="977063">It was incorporated in December 1957 under the Tennessee Utility District Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.745" offset="1002350">Under the provisions of that law, a group of local real property holders in Hawkins County filed a petition with the county court setting forth the statement of the need for the service to be supplied, the estimated cost and the names of free local residence proposed these commissioners of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.203" offset="1076224">After a hearing, the chairman of the county court, the chairman of the county court is a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.862" offset="1102869">The chairman of the county court found that public convenience and necessity justified the creation of the proposed district that it was economically sound and desirable and accordingly granted the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.351" offset="1148740">The chairman of the county court as required by the state law appointed its commissioners of the newly created district, the three persons nominated in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.665" offset="1190013">The district was financed through the private sale of bonds and no public money was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.906" offset="1214986">The district constructed a natural gas distribution system with the proceeds of the bond sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.191" offset="1236093">Under the statute, the gas system became subject to a lien in favor of the bond holders until the debt was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.190" offset="1264097">Principal and interest on the bonds are payable solely from the revenues of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.038" offset="1283532">The rates charged by the district must be sufficient to pay its expenses and as bonded in datedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.231" offset="1304325">The district has no power to levy or collect taxes and its service charges are not to be construed as taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.081" offset="1335672">The powers of the district are vested in and exercised by three member board of commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.833" offset="1358660">The commissioners are not subject to county or state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.893" offset="1374960">They adopt the necessary rules and regulations and set the district service fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.445" offset="1397112">They control the labor relations of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.293" offset="1408502">And under their supervision, the manager of the district hires and fires employees and sets their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.422" offset="1433057">Neither the state nor the county has any control over the district’s employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.510" offset="1457403">The state statute also gives the district the power of eminent domain as the Chief Justice has already alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.884" offset="1486869">And it authorizes the board of commissioners to inquire into any matter relating to the affairs of the district and to carry out this function to issue subpoenas and administer oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.264" offset="1532426">Finally, the enabling Tennessee statute provides that a utility district is a municipality or public corporation and exemption from state, county or local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.405" offset="1581014">The Supreme Court of Tennessee has upheld this tax exemption on the ground that such a district is an arm or an instrumentality of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.806" offset="1622601">As I stated earlier, the court below concluded that state law governs the determination whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and under the laws of Tennessee as confirmed by the highest court of that state, the district here is a political subdivision and therefore refused to enforce the board's bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.965" offset="1731271">The Fourth Circuit on the other hand in dealing with a related type of problem has rejected the contention that state law governs the determination of whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and as held the federal standards govern the determination of whether or not that particular entity is a political subdivision or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.897" offset="1930951">I had not fully appreciated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.508" offset="1949445">Now, both the act and this legislative history are silent as to the meaning that Congress sought to attribute to the phrase political subdivision of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.769" offset="2006497">The obvious purpose of course, of Congress was to avoid, to avoid interference and to the labor relations the employment relations of -- between a governmental entity and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.501" offset="2061354">Now, I shall not attempt to give any kind of a comprehensive definition of what a political subdivision is.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.814" offset="2086640">Indeed the cases tell us, the cases tell us that an entity may be a political subdivision for purposes of one statute and not another.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.321" offset="2124675">Now, any definition of a political subdivision for the purpose of the statute, must I think taken to account the basic purpose which underlies the Governmental exemption in the statute, namely the avoidance of interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.412" offset="2180995">The avoidance of interference into the employment and labor relations between a state, between a governmental entity and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.631" offset="2233866">So therefore the threshold question in this case as it was in the Missouri Transit Workers case decided by this Court several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.763" offset="2266467">The threshold question in this case here, do we have that kind of state involvement in the creation, the administration, the operation and particularly the labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.220" offset="2312234">The employment relations of the districts, do we have that kind of state involvement here that should bring in to play, should bring in to play the congressional purpose to bar the labor board from intruding, from intruding into the labor relations of a governmental entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.618" offset="2381824">I submit that the answer to that question is that we do not have that kind of state involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.710" offset="2406170">The state did not directly create the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.689" offset="2418082">It was formed by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.221" offset="2428217">It is not administered by publicly elected officials or their designees.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.656" offset="2445981">It has not become assimilated or incorporated into the state or local government so as to become one of its constituent parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.116" offset="2475865">The county judge exercises no independent judgment in appointing the districts commissioners except in the remote contingency that two of the commissioners may not be able to agree on filling a vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.554" offset="2525602">The Tennessee statute requires him to appoint those persons nominated in the petition filed by the local property owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.053" offset="2723610">There is in Tennessee an ouster statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.515" offset="2745448">And under this ouster statute, the ouster statute provides that where an official of a municipality or political subdivision is failing to perform his duties that the Attorney General of the state or the city attorney or the county attorney as the case maybe, may bring ouster proceedings in court, whether any such power has ever been exercised with the respect to any of these districts and we are told that there are approximately 270 of them in the State of Tennessee, I don’t know.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.757" offset="2894451">Now, the utility system is owned by the district itself and is not state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.292" offset="2916498">It has no authority to levy taxes and must meet its expenses and obligations from its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.659" offset="2941994">The district is completely autonomous in the conduct of its affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.580" offset="2957667">The state exercises no supervisory power over the conduct of the district's day to day affairs or its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.366" offset="2988805">Indeed, the Tennessee statute expressly bars any state public utility commission from exercising any jurisdiction over the management and control of the system or its rates or charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.224" offset="3036244">Finally, the district alone exercises the power to hire and fire employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.634" offset="3061948">The state does not control either directly or indirectly the terms and conditions of employment for the district and apparently on the basis of a decision by a Circuit Court of Appeals in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.501" offset="3121403">Apparently these employees are not deemed to be subject to the state restrictions applicable to the state or municipal employees with the respect to strikes and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.030" offset="3159542">Essentially, the district appears to be -- the board found that essentially it’s a private venture to be sure for the benefit of the community and for the benefit of the community but nonetheless a private venture having no identity or relationship to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.918" offset="3231013">Now of course, as the State of Tennessee as seen fit to its legislature to characterize, to label this district here as a political subdivision of the state as a municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.454" offset="3297155">But that factor cannot be dispositive of the status of this district here for purposes of the federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.593" offset="3337697">As this Court said some years ago, the Labor Act is a federal legislation administered by a national agency to solve a national problem on a national scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.881" offset="3390882">And the general principle is that normally that Congress intends that it's law shall have uniform application so that its programs would not be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.851" offset="3442813">Now, of course, a state has an important interest in defining its political subdivision and the board of course pays considerable attention to the state's legitimate interest in defining its political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.590" offset="3553782">But that interest it seems to us must be weighed, must be weighed against the policies of the statute and the uniform application of those policies which this Court had repeatedly confirmed Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.480" offset="3609266">Now, local considerations, local problems may prompt a state, may prompt a state to characterize as a political subdivision, what is essentially a private venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.440" offset="3669138">Having no real identity or relationship to the state and over which a state exercises no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.024" offset="3699440">If state by state characterizations of an entity as a political subdivision were to be determinative of the problem, then the result might well be a patchwork of policies, a patchwork of policies and exemptions from the provisions of the statute which have no relation to the underlying purpose of the governmental exemption in the statute, namely the avoidance of interference and the employment in labor relations between a governmental entity and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.085" offset="3839666">I don’t believe (Inaudible) say that in this particular case that the State of Tennessee has seen fit to label a district as a political subdivision not because it really regards as an armed or instrumentality or a department of the state but rather because it sought to give us some kind of tax exemption and thereby encourage you, encourage local citizens, local property holders here to create these districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.639" offset="7721880">It is the position of respondent here that the question presented is not whether the state or federal determination controls whether the utility district is a political subdivision under Section 2.2 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.510" offset="7805367">Respondent agrees that state law is not controlling but that state law is a factor along with all the other factors to be considered in reaching this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.556" offset="7865553">It is respondent’s position further that there was no conflict between the Hawkins County case in the Sixth Circuit below and the Randolph case which is referred to by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.861" offset="7922813">Respondent accepts the rule in the Randolph case which is to the extent that the board has considered the economic realities and the statutory purposes, its determination is entitled to great respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.418" offset="7989060">It is simply submitted that the board inadequately and improperly considered the economic realities and the statutory purposes and that to the extent, the Court of Appeals below in the last two sentences of the opinion which was several pages long stated that state law is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.596" offset="8081742">Respondent explains this the same way that the board has explained one of its decisions in its brief that state law is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.659" offset="8121971">The board has held state law to be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.568" offset="8133674">But now on page 19 on a footnote to its brief, it states that that language was not necessary for the result reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.758" offset="8174425">Now that is exactly the position of respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.052" offset="8187591">Because what the Court of Appeals did for several pages is take the rule in the Randolph case and apply by examining the economic realities one at a time and deciding that the board had inadequately and improperly considered that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.969" offset="8267212">We have here basically a jurisdictional matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.872" offset="9426840">But once the system was setup, the Mayor nominated a board of directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.757" offset="13102373">We certainly as a stronger form of the power of eminent domain then for instance a telephone company might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.312" offset="13160573">In addition to these factors that we have referred to, Section 62612 of the Utility District Act grants to the district all the powers necessary and requisite capable of being delegated by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.438" offset="13237164">So, we contend that when all of these factors are added up and the totality of the picture is before this Court, the conclusion must follow that we have an exempt municipality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.624" offset="13369866">We also have another late board case granting the exemption to the City of Austell Natural Gas system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.221" offset="13428276">The difference if you can call this a difference is that in these cases the board of trustees was appointed by a Mayor, rather than by a county judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.031" offset="13471535">And the board's standard which the board states in its brief is controlling, that is how the labor relations are carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.681" offset="13514062">It is submitted that the labor relations in the district and the labor relations in the Austell Natural Gas case and LaFayette-Lincoln electric system case carry on exactly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.717" offset="13562232">That is there is a manager who hires the employees and that as far as the commissioners are concerned, they more or less direct the operations of the gas system in the Austell case or the gas system in the utility district of Hawkins County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.749" offset="13646346">So we submit that considering these two cases, we can find no distinction between them and the case that is before us.</text>
