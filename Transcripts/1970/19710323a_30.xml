            <text syncTime="60.353" offset="344795">The particular aspect of the question which this case presents is what law enforcement officers are supposed to do when they get information from someone who has not given information in the past and who is unwilling to let his name be used, but who nevertheless gives information which a responsible law enforcement officers feels he cannot ignore.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.343" offset="800789">If in fact he had done so, and certainly at least, we have to take this case because he did not claim to have had information in the past is representing the situation of an informer who had not given information in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.634" offset="1405889">I think he is saying, I offer you my judgment that this is a person that I can trust and that gets us to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.466" offset="1453223">One gets information from person who has not given information in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.249" offset="1484361">Now, the one thing that’s clear about his affidavit, on page 4 of the Government’s brief, is that the informant is talking from personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.493" offset="1525321">What he had said is that this person has personal knowledge, and I’m quoting, “of and has purchased illicit whiskey from within the residence described for a period of more than two years and most recently, within the past two weeks, has knowledge of a person who purchased illicit whiskey within the past two days from the house, has personal knowledge that the illicit whiskey is consumed by purchases in the out building known and utilized as a dance hall and has seen Roosevelt Harris go to the other outbuilding located about 50 yards from the residence on numerous occasions to obtain the whiskey for this person and other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.644" offset="1697938">So, that this case is clearly distinguishable from most of the situations that have come before this Court where we do not know the basis of the informants -- not, we do, it is personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.677" offset="1754049">And through the personal knowledge that’s the two weeks before the day, but that this is not stale information is alleged – well, I think would appear anyway from the nature of the business, but the fact that he knows, apparently the informant knows somebody who bought whiskey two days before the date of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.741" offset="1854360">I take it the only importance of that is to show that the business is still going on, not just a presumption, but that bit of information adds that.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.215" offset="1920188">I take it that if the informer had given his own information, has his own affidavit by name and it would not be hearsay, it would be his own affidavit, there’s no question that a search warrant could’ve issued on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.326" offset="1980688">Now, the question is should it be different when the informer is afraid or unwilling or for some reason will not make the affidavit to the magistrate, but is willing to make this sworn statement to the investigator.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.289" offset="2904482">Now, there are two things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.622" offset="2913886">I know nothing more about this case that appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.506" offset="2925380">There are two things here that appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.484" offset="2933321">One that they had this information over four years and acted apparently the day they got somebody who had personal knowledge though that -- I assume they haven’t been able to do it very easily before and the other thing that appears is that the statement that the informer says, he fears for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.576" offset="2997687">That’s -- those are the two things that appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.341" offset="3008763">The fact is however that there are again lots of situations, not this case but there are certainly many and the rules have to be considered beyond just this case as to what does one do about first information where either because of time or circumstances corroboration, you can't have a long investigation for further corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.611" offset="3137808">And one of the first things I think first one has to ask oneself when you got to this question is what would be the motive for an informant to lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.947" offset="3179186">I understand that an informant might have a motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.213" offset="3204263">It seems to me two motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.744" offset="3214399">One is if he’s an accomplice, he is somebody involved, he’s arrested, he wants to do something for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.978" offset="3239267">If I give information to the police, maybe they’ll go easy and the other is grudge against a particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.873" offset="3278869">Neither of those, it seems to me involves a motive to lie particularly in relation to search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.519" offset="3313455">Because you’re not going to accomplish anything for the police and therefore, for betterment of yourself or you’re not really going to get the man you have a grudge against in jail if you send the police out on goose chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.516" offset="3381478">So, the informant by a grudge or by hoping to better himself has a motive to give correct information.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.704" offset="3434141">He probably wouldn’t do it unless he had some motive that kind of assuming he’s not the good citizen but the person involved in criminality in some form or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.520" offset="3481475">But I have been trying to see what benefit he would gain for himself by lying and I frankly have not been able to think of any, but assuming that even so, we need some determination as to the honesty of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.723" offset="3570291">The question is how do you get it if you can’t for some reason have a further investigation or a further surveillance and you do it at one end or the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="878.878" offset="3618879">Either, what do you know about the person who gives the information or what do you know about the person informed against?</text>
            <text syncTime="889.055" offset="3659630">Now, in some cases, I take it, not this one, in some cases, I take it you could say, I have received information from a respectable citizen who had absolutely no motive to lie that he has personal knowledge of such and such occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.208" offset="3740191">It seems to me, something a magistrate could properly give a weight to in determining whether to believe an informant who according to report speaks not on hearsay, but on personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.064" offset="3827649">Now one just has to bear in mind in that situation, that the more you describe the informant, the more you tend to identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.982" offset="3871326">If you say -- if an investigator says, “I got this information from a hotel maid who was there at nine o’ clock in the morning or something like that, It isn’t very hard for anybody who wanted to find out who that hotel maid is.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.205" offset="3932244">Nevertheless, I do think, that in some situations, an investigator could probably say, I have received report from a citizen who had absolutely motive by, who’s well regarded in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.191" offset="4004133">The investigator here did about or I guess I thought he could do, he said, I have interviewed this person, received a statement under oath and I’m giving you my judgment that he’s a credible person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.751" offset="4694392">Unfortunately, it is true that people have reputations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.836" offset="5014758">This Court said, as long ago was 164 United States that good reputation can make the difference between innocence and guilt in the trial of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.575" offset="5249651">This is contrary to the fact, to Carroll, to Brinegar, to Jones, to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.508" offset="5281416">As I say, it is contrary to the old Edgington case about good character and really we keep bad reputation out of the trial not because it’s irrelevant, but because too much weight could be attacked to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.861" offset="5346826">And so it seems to me that at least in a situation here, as I say, where we’re dealing with an informer who speaks from personal knowledge, certainly at least in that situation and the question is merely, can we act on this personal knowledge even though we don’t know this man, we haven’t dealt with him before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.342" offset="5448704">You consider the fact that the person he is informing against has been the subject of a lot of suspicion and not even, if I have to narrow it beyond that, I guess, it’s particularly true in fields like liquor and narcotics where reputations are generally have some backing, that it’s certainly it is true that it is possible for somebody have the name without the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.534" offset="5589556">But it is extremely unlikely with relation to premises where liquor is sold and therefore, when you get as I say not a vague kind of suspicion, not of tip, but an informant who at least to the officer is willing to make his statements under oath, then it seems to me whether you -- and issue is as Mr. Justice White said at the begin, do you believe your informant?</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.659" offset="5817971">Secondly, the officer is willing to swear that he has examined the man and found him a credible person and thirdly, the person informed against is someone who has had his general reputation and I take it, they were trying to get and could not really get a way of checking the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.639" offset="5893935">Now, let’s not forget that this isn’t guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.621" offset="6781889">But it seems to me in relation to this matter of warrants that those who must deal with the police and sort of train them, must make them understand what this is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.160" offset="6839986">Now, I think it is possible to make investigatory or law enforcement agencies generally understand that you can’t barge in within a warrant, that you can’t barge in on just reputation because that’s not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.476" offset="6921279">I’m not disputing that the police sometimes find this very exasperating and you know, they want to act in a hurry but I think these are principles that can’t be explained and understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.883" offset="6970911">But I think that if we try to lay down rules that are contrary to normal experience of law enforcement officers then law becomes to them something sort of art and a series of rigid rules that they don’t understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.275" offset="7060459">And I truthfully believe when you said to say to a law -- a liquor, alcohol and tax investigating officer that when he gets an informant, the fact that he’s sort of heard rumors about this place, let's put it as vague as that, for four years it's something that’s entitled -- to no vague whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.427" offset="7161083">It’s just contrary to like as he understands it and something that’s going to make -- that becomes a rule that to him does not in accord with experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.785" offset="7218552">And I think that it is in the long run to the interest of good law enforcement that we uphold reasonable judgments and I think in this case, where the officer had information on personal knowledge, which he thought came from a credible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.829" offset="7346657">But which also coincided with a lot of other unspecific information that he had been acquiring over four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.426" offset="7393050">It was proper for him to ask for search warrant and proper for the magistrate to give it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.102" offset="7603806">The circumstances however are paralleled by similar circumstances in every metropolitan area and indeed now suburban areas that I’m sure this Court is all too familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.476" offset="7649259">The circumstance in which a law enforcement officer familiar with some reputation of a particular suspect becomes on a given day possessed of information not derived from his own observations, but from the say so of the layman that in the legal stimulant it's harbored in a given house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.692" offset="7734105">That to be sure, it probably happens hundreds of times a day in metropolises of this country with respect to narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.636" offset="7809964">I think we can say on this record that this is a case in which an officer got possession of information from someone, not another law enforcement officer and not from his own observations to the effect that there was an illegal stimulant in this case, non-tax paid whiskey in someone’s premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.113" offset="9071783">Even more important in settling a meaning is coming up with some basis for a magistrate to assess whether that judgment of prudence is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.260" offset="9428407">As to the details, Your Honor, I think there’s very little you can attribute to that in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.104" offset="9447737">Details in no sense resemble the details in Draper which were details predictive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.085" offset="9475741">In that case, it could be said that when details given by an informant was subsequently confirmed by an agent and after all they had a chance in that case not to eventuate, the informant became more credible because the information predicted was in fact confirmed to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.697" offset="9546167">And indeed, the informant’s, the likelihood that the informant was giving personal information was increased by the nature of the detail in Draper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.494" offset="9577305">There’s virtually no real detail in this affidavit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.375" offset="9592874">The detail given pertains to the relationship among buildings on a given -- in a given residence in a at best medium size town publicly observable detail that suggests no particularly intimacy on the part of the informant or any particular credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.624" offset="9665912">Indeed, it should be noted that as to that detail, the investigator in this case didn’t even go so far as far as this record shows to confirm that before applying for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.236" offset="9708335">So, the confirmation aspect of Draper was wholly out of the case and the personal observation aspect to Draper is likewise not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.718" offset="9750235">The critical point is though, that nothing in this case, as decided by the Sixth Circuit impairs law enforcement at all or certainly not to any degree sufficient to outweigh the interest of the individual security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.558" offset="9813556">That after all is the test under the Fourth Amendment is a search reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.754" offset="9834350">Reasonable as involved balance and this Court has expressed that test in Camara and Terry as a -- the balancing of the need to search against the enormity of the invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.773" offset="9890461">In this case, a number of alternative opportunities were presented to the affiant officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.925" offset="9915120">Even if it were true, that a buy had been difficult to make in four years, a fact which itself would undermine it seems to me the merit of the -- of the notion that this affidavit created probable cause, even if that were true, that wasn’t the only technique available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.108" offset="9987845">Such a buy to be sure would be constitutional as would the procedure established by United States against Lewis in which the buy is not made by the informant at all, but by a Government agent who calls the premises and sees whether he can make a buy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.740" offset="10070288">In Lewis, the Government agent actually went to the premises and made the buy, came back at second time, made another buy and had evidence available for trial, but even if the buy were not possible, in the course of the conversation as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested in his dissent in Lewis, in the course of the conversation about the buy, the homeowner alleged to have illegal whiskey on his premises might well say something to substantiate probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.400" offset="10192959">Who are you?</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.730" offset="10194317">I’ve never heard you before?</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.195" offset="10200168">How do I know that you’re not a cop?</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.116" offset="10207796">That kind of conversation with a Government Agent who has received information that there is illegal liquor at a certain place might well and I would suggest in many instances would enhance the probable cause that he could present to a magistrate in an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.807" offset="10286582">So, it’s not simply the question of whether a buy was available, an available technique, a buy by the informant or a buy by the Government agent but whether other investigative techniques in this case such a mere phone call would not have in fact turn up enough strongly indicative evidence of involvement in the traffic of illegal alcohol as to warrant a proper affidavit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.934" offset="10391071">I don’t even suggest that there are cases in which that kind of further investigation may not be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.022" offset="10427434">The Americans for Law Enforcement filing an amicus curiae brief present here a case, in which, in course of that brief, in which a cash register is stolen from a grocery store and the cashier in the grocery store, a young employee some days later observes the cash register in somebody’s house and here is the owner of that house boosted that he stole it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.847" offset="10518758">Well, that’s not a situation in which the law enforcement can make a buy or can make phone calls to see whether they can make a buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.331" offset="10552717">And so, the police officer in the real life case posited by the Americans for Law Enforcement went around the neighborhood, asked the neighbors of the informant, “Is he reliable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.294" offset="10604544">Is he credible?</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.909" offset="10607052">What’s his reputation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.175" offset="10612067">Checked with the police, to see whether he had a criminal record or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.867" offset="10626800">Checked with his employer to see whether the employee would have any motivation in that case to lie or fabricate or distort a fact that just as strong as lying in the formation of affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.623" offset="10677896">Having gone through that process, the officer could at least present in an affidavit to a magistrate the notion that he had done his best to clear the reputation of this informant for truth and veracity in that environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.957" offset="12295189">I would hope that at all times, I’d tell the truth but I don’t think that Court -- that kind of assertion which is on this record the swearing may well have been does much to buttress anyone’s reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.429" offset="12353076">Given the alternatives that are available to law enforcement, in a circumstance like this, involving minimal law enforcement impingement and indeed alternatives that are commonly used throughout the country, the suggestion that this Court ought to put its (Inaudible) upon a confirmation of reliability amounting to no more than the use of an ambiguous term in an affidavit is a suggestion in effect that this Court can sign over to the police, the security of persons and their houses, not simply the security of persons and their houses in the discretion of the police, but in the discretion of the police acting upon an inarticulate hunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.313" offset="12540635">This Court has said its face against an inarticulate hunch even from the officer in Nathanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.603" offset="12565817">And from that point on, in every affidavit case this Court has ever considered this case amounts to more than an inarticulate hunch after an interview, that someone may be giving reliable information about a person who mysteriously has been known to be in the business of trafficking in illegal alcohol for four years but about whom no better information appears to have been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.532" offset="12657455">And whom -- in relation to whom maybe some difficulty in making any buy at all to confirm that he’s in fact engaged in that traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.347" offset="12704789">Under these circumstances, I suggest that an affirmance of the Sixth Circuit's decision would do nothing to impair effective law enforcement and a reversal would do enormous damage to the protections of the Fourth Amendment that this Court has zealously guarded over the years.</text>
