            <label>Mr. Edward De Grazia</label>
            <text syncTime="34.336" offset="240724">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.767" offset="258487">This case is here on appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Maryland which affirmed an order of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, upholding a decision by the State Board of Censors disapproving the film “I Am Curious Yellow” for exhibition in the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.091" offset="343751">The Maryland Film Censorship scheme under which “I Am Curious Yellow” was banned throughout the state is an amended version of the law which this Court held without dissent to be an unconstitutional previous restraint in Freedman v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.617" offset="421804">Maryland in fact is the only state today which still retains a law on its books, making criminal the failure of Motion picture exhibitors to obtain prior approval by a censorship board of a film intended to be shown to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.990" offset="499336">“I am curios Yellow” was imported from Sweden by it's American distributor Grove Press and it immediately became the subject of a custom's forfeiture proceeding, but 11 months later was finally held to be constitutionally protected and not obscene by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.032" offset="619499">Soon thereafter, appellant, Five West Amusement Company, Inc. contracted with Grove to exhibit “I Am Curios Yellow” in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.445" offset="665161">In accordance with Grove's national distribution policy, the agreement provided that admission to the film would be limited to persons 18 years of age and older and the Grove would control all advertising copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.885" offset="734960">On July 1, 1969 as required by the statute, appellants submitted “I Am Curious Yellow” to the Maryland Film Censorship Board consisting of three adult ladies, who following consultation with the State's Chief Law Enforcement Officer and the Honorable Attorney General of Maryland, found the film obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.215" offset="824195">No record was made of the Board's proceedings and although witnesses were heard, their identity and their testimony was kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.451" offset="865155">No findings or supporting reasons were given by the Board in issuing its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.293" offset="892531">As required by the statute, following its disapproval, the Censorship Board petitioned the Circuit Court of Baltimore City asking it to approve its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.892" offset="934954">And after a hearing, an adversary hearing in which witnesses were heard on both sides, the Court affirmed the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.165" offset="976018">Appellants here appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals of Maryland which considered the matter de novo and found the statute unconstitutional and the Motion picture obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.367" offset="1028890">The Maryland Court of Appeals reached its decision by a four to three division, disagreeing sharply over the conclusions to be drawn from the application of this Court's Roth-Memoirs test for distinguishing protected expression from obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.838" offset="1102764">The majority saw fit also to disregard the decision reached with regard to the same film by the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.331" offset="1212688">Well, I was going to -- in fact Your Honor, would have referred later to Chief Judge Lumbard's dissent in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.633" offset="1241945">I think it is notorious that there are very rare cases in this field in which there is not a division of the justices at whatever level of court we may look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.717" offset="1286248">The issues presented by this appeal are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.150" offset="1304012">Before I get to the issues, I would like to state that in terms of the Court of Appeals of Maryland's majority opinion, although the majority applied the Roth-Memoirs three-pronged test, the court gave special weight to “the visual impact of a Motion picture as contrasted with the printed word.”</text>
            <text syncTime="325.752" offset="1406412">The issues presented by this appeal are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.214" offset="1416234">First is the Maryland statute defective as applied to “I Am Curious Yellow,” and second is “I Am Curious Yellow” obscenity or is it protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.839" offset="1466702">It is our position that the Maryland Film Censorship scheme is fatally defective because it is over broad and because it fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.456" offset="1509230">The statute requires the Board to disapprove any film that is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.459" offset="1529187">The only definition of obscene provided by the statute however reaches any film whose effect is to “arouse sexual desires,” if that affect probably “outweighs whatever other merits the film may posses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="376.689" offset="1610167">The trouble with this definition is that it is in conflict with Roth and every other case that is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.676" offset="1654053">This Court has never to my knowledge suggested that books or films maybe censored for arousing sexual desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.996" offset="1683310">Any film with a handsome actor might be perceived by lady censors as arousing sexual desires particularly if the actor appears naked if only for a few moments as he did in “I Am Curious Yellow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.317" offset="1740675">Similarly, any film starring a nude woman maybe perceived by a man as arousing sexual desires, particularly if the man -- I'm sorry, particularly if the actress appears naked even for a few moments as she did in “I Am Curious Yellow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="428.078" offset="1815698">Moreover, the statute commands that the arousing affect be weighed against the film's other values.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.729" offset="1842239">In this respect it is submitted, the statute is in conflict with this Court's judgment and Mr. Justice Goldberg's opinion in Jacobellis versus Ohio and is also in conflict, we submit, with Mr. Justice White's dissent in Memoirs v. Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.339" offset="1928756">Finally, the Board is not required by the statute to consider whether the film goes substantially beyond contemporary community standards in its sexual depictions as this Court in Manual Enterprises versus Day held must be done before material can be found obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.810" offset="1994585">In this regard, the film is also in conflict with this Court's judgments and the prevailing opinions in Jacobellis, Memoirs and Redrup versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.335" offset="2040665">Secondly, the Maryland Censorship scheme is defective because of its procedural defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.797" offset="2062608">No record is made or required to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.374" offset="2076818">The witnesses, there is no requirement that witnesses be revealed and their deliberations, the deliberations of the Board are secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.918" offset="2107016">No grounds are given for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.514" offset="2117465">The censors here have no function other than censorship whereas in the case of the Post Office as has been described today a possibly analogous role, the censors deal with other matters than obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.745" offset="2722356">Well, let's assume that the first action was inadequate in some ways, isn't it irrelevant after the Court of Appeals of Maryland has taken – the steps it's taken?</text>

            <text syncTime="667.608" offset="2773765">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, if the statute permitted this film or any film, at least any film which had been the subject of a prior positive judicial action to remain free for exhibition during the pendency of the board's hearings and the legal proceedings thereafter, I would say yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.241" offset="2868328">But I don't believe that it is the teaching of this Court that censors are -- the censorship boards are free to reach erroneous conclusions through inadequate practices and procedures subject to the saving grace of a final judicial decision which as is perfectly plain in this case is more than a year after the film was originally suppressed in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.892" offset="2998941">I would like to refer the Court also to Kingsley Books v.

            <text syncTime="745.268" offset="3084413">Again, I wish to emphasize that in a case such as this where the film already known to the Censorship Board and known to the courts, the film already had been held constitutionally protected by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.583" offset="3137703">Surely in the case such as this, there is no sufficient warrant for a board or a court to suppress the exhibition of a film, pending a final adjudication by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.812" offset="3194650">My second point is that “I Am Curious Yellow” cannot be held obscene under any of this Court's test since Roth.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.273" offset="3540511">It seems to me that a decision by any justice, any judge of a federal or state court should be enough to warn another -- a sister court away from a decision which suppresses a film.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.329" offset="3944678">As Judge Hayes said in the Second Circuit decision, “Whatever the dominant theme of this film may said to be, it is certainly not sex.”</text>
            <text syncTime="968.753" offset="3978428">Moreover, not only is the sexual theme subordinate, but it is handled in such a way as to make it at least extremely doubtful that interest in it should be characterized as prurient.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.112" offset="4027852">The same conclusion that this film is constitutionally protected also plainly follows from this Court's decision subsequent to Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.232" offset="4080306">I would wish to mention at this juncture two important facts about the Roth-Memoirs test.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.880" offset="4102875">First as was documented by the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography's recent report, and I must quote this to you, “the three-part definition adopted in the plurality opinion in the Fanny Hill case is the version which has been codified into a number of state statutes, and it is the one which is almost universally used in state and lower federal courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.442" offset="4201096">Second, the judgments required by Memoirs are enormously difficult to make with regard to particular materials and it is very easy for different judges and jurors to reach opposite conclusions as the same works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.912" offset="4255013">As is well known, the recommendations of the commission are that all laws which prohibit or interfere with consensual distribution of obscene materials to adult should be repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.391" offset="4296913">And that as this Court has intimated in such decisions as Redrup and Stanley, and Rowan v. Post Office, only laws aimed at the protection of juveniles or at the prevention of obtrusive or assaultive communications to unwilling or captive adults, are consistent with the constitutional values of free expression.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis B. Burch</label>
            <text syncTime="1756.283" offset="7128482">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.472" offset="7145305">I would make apologies at the outset if I have a question put to me and have a little difficulty in hearing it and I just simply want to apologize in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.867" offset="7190862">I had originally intended to argue this case by addressing myself first to the obscenity issue and then very lightly at the end to the questions raised by my brother with respect to the statute itself, the whole system of pre-censorship in Maryland and the question of preemption by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.752" offset="7290337">But let me, since he have made quite a point of both of those matters, let me first, if I may, go to the question of the over breadth of the Maryland statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.740" offset="7326281">I believe Mr. Justice Stewart, you pointed out that the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the Sansone case addressed itself specifically to that problem and held that obscenity was obscenity within the constitutional sense and that is all that could be banned by the Maryland Censorship Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.193" offset="7392110">And I might say that that brings to mind the Shuttlesworth case in Alabama where this Court held that plastic surgery on a statute which would otherwise be in violation of the First Amendment rights could act prospectively so that the surgery would correct whatever defect there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.428" offset="7469119">So we think Shuttlesworth is a complete answer to the point raised by my brother on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.918" offset="7491062">With respect to the preemption, again, going to the question of the statute itself, my brother refers to the Kingsley case, the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.496" offset="7541321">I simply point out that that was in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.402" offset="7556995">The Freedman case which dealt specifically with the Maryland's system of pre-censorship was decided in 1965 and it's very much on point, so I don't know why he would ask this Court having once addressed itself to the Maryland statute, having found that it could constitutionally be amended which it was, sorry, and it was so amended that now, he brings up the Brown case of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.517" offset="7661484">On the question of preemption by the Second Circuit, first of all, we have an entirely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.970" offset="7691264">It would be a completely new theory of the law and frankly, we've researched it and we find nothing which would suggest that preemption would be appropriate in this particular case, but let's look at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.821" offset="7738702">First of all, we were not party to the federal suit in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.244" offset="7756361">There was no expert witness offered by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.252" offset="7772348">The case was tried before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.025" offset="7783424">We had no right of appeal so he would say that if a court in some other jurisdiction were to decide the issue without ever our having had any opportunity whatsoever to enforce the rights of our statutes that we should be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.218" offset="7844237">I think simply to state the question is to answer, I don't believe that this Court will ever take such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.484" offset="7873285">Now, I can't let it pass when we get to the question of obscenity, the description that my brother had or gave of the sex in this picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.070" offset="7927620">He talked about a few fleeting moments of a man in the nude and a girl in the nude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.131" offset="7955937">He says and he acknowledges that hardcore pornography even under the unusual test that he suggests that hardcore pornography would be properly banned by any jurisdiction whether it be federal or state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.464" offset="8005256">I would like ,if the Court is not already familiar with it, simply to refer of the description of the 17 -- in the -- Your Honors would pardon me for just a minute, I would like to find the particular reference of what this film is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.008" offset="8163453">While I look for that, if I may, I would like to make one further comment about the theme of this movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.384" offset="8200861">There were some very interesting characterizations of the various things, Martin Luther King, the unrest in Sweden and this and that, and the other thing, and that this therefore gave it a redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.159" offset="8256031">I think it's interesting if the Court will recall in our brief the reference to Rex Reed's critique of the film I think in the New York Times in which he related a very interesting incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.121" offset="8311829">When the film had been shown to those who were going to write it to the critics that after the film had been shown, it was found out that the projectionist had put the second reel -- the third reel second and the second reel last.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.366" offset="8380792">In other words, the theme was so completely disorganized and that there really wasn't anything that they didn't even know which film went where.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.917" offset="8415065">And if you will look at Judge Lumbard's opinion in the New York case, you will find that they did the same thing when that case -- when that film was exhibited to the court and the jury because in his opinion, Judge Lumbard says “The final scene in conformity to the dominant theme shows the female lead performing an orchiectomy or a episiotomy, or both on her murdered lover with a kitchen carving knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.173" offset="8520077">This happened to be in the second reel and not in the third reel, but when they showed it to the jury and to the court, it ended up but being in the third reel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.745" offset="8558320">Now, let's look at what the sex is in this movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.667" offset="8578069">I'm not going to use some of the expressions that we use such as in the opening scene when the young lady talks about what she can do in Rio de Janeiro for free, but you have a display of erotic Indian sculpture depicting a man with his hand on the woman's vagina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.080" offset="8643688">You have a discussion between Lena and another girl about different methods of masturbation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.717" offset="8662288">You have the dialogue “are you that stupid,” so you don't give a -- you know what about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.330" offset="8684648">Detailed love making scene in Lena's room showing both parties completely naked, exposing the male genital area, showing attempted intercourse against a wall, and also showing a scene of Börje caressing the girl's breast with his tongue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.213" offset="8744208">A scene depicting sexual intercourse between Börje and Lena on the palace balustrade in which although the parties are clothed, the act of intercourse is vividly displayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.323" offset="8784645">Scenes of nudity at the retreat and scenes depicting Lena looking at a sex manual showing various unusual positions for sexual intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.634" offset="8817873">Scene at the retreat showing Börje throwing Lena to the ground and committing an act of cunnilingus followed by a scene depicting the parties both completely nude with Lena kissing Börje's penis as he caresses her vagina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.444" offset="8865102">A discussion regarding sex which makes both of them horny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.367" offset="8880880">Scenes depicting intercourse in the water, scenes depicting sexual intercourse in a tree between Lena and Börje, scenes showing fully the naked bodies of the two lying on the floor engaged in either actual sodomy or sexual intercourse with the man behind the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.401" offset="8949008">This scene also dramatically emphasizes the erotic effects of the copulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.034" offset="8967502">I could go one and I could talk about the genitals in other scenes, I could talk about the tremendous active scene when he chases her into another room, throws her to the floor and has what appears to be intercourse in the nude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.277" offset="9016508">Throughout this picture, you have ten or twelve minutes of sexuality, but it's the most explicit sexuality that's ever been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.794" offset="9046497">You also have in the record the statement of the producer that what he sent over here to the United States to Grove Press as the material that would be used to sell the picture was mostly the emphasis on the sexual aspect of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.720" offset="9118281">All of these is the dominant theme and it was so held by the lower court in our case, it was held by the lower court by the jury in the New York case, it was held by the lower court in the New York case, it was held by one of the two judges in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.186" offset="9176168">It was held by the lower court in our case and it was held by the Court of Appeals by a divided four to three opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.464" offset="9201246">It was also held by a number of other cases, courts throughout the country that had had the opportunity to address itself to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.076" offset="9227682">They have found that this is a predominantly sexual obscene picture and that it has no redeeming social value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.309" offset="9328619">The sex in here is only to sell the film, the rest of it is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.049" offset="9343561">The “I Am Curious Blue” case; this picture was developed by a series of interviews such as you see Lena conducting on the street and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.497" offset="9389328">They took all of that, they extracted from it, that which they wanted to put in “I Am Curious Yellow” with about 95% of the sex that they've seen -- that they filmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.575" offset="9425690">They put that together and they sold “I Am Curious Yellow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.497" offset="9437393">Then they came along with “I Am Curious Blue” and what a disappointment to those who we're looking for sex because if -- it reminded me of the comment by Mr. Justice Stewart or Mr. Justice Goldberg who said that the -- in the Lover's case, Jacobellis' case that the sex in it was so fleeting that you would've known it except how you've been censored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.985" offset="9523284">In this case, this is exactly what they did and they ended up with “I Am Curious Blue” and what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.987" offset="9547316">5.5 million people have gone to see “I Am Curious Yellow” according to my brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.501" offset="9569364">In 40 states it has been shown in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.566" offset="9577618">It was at the top of the box office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.156" offset="9587963">I'd tell you, I've gone all over those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.165" offset="9596008">It was in the top ten -- top two or three in the country for four or five weeks running.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.550" offset="9613563">Along came on “I Am Curious Blue”, no sex, the same types have been used, the same depiction of unrest and social this and that and the other thing, and what happened in about four or five weeks, it's fallen flat on its face and I doubt very seriously whether it's being shown in the other states in the county today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.192" offset="9676152">Why, because it has no theme, it has no social redeeming value and it has no sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.096" offset="9699767">If it had the sex that “I Am Curious Yellow” had, it would also probably be seen by the same number of people if they continued to show it as they have in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.752" offset="9734353">So it is now against me to the part of the argument of addressing myself to what is the state of the law on this whole question and I agree is confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.615" offset="9785866">I agree that it's very difficult to read the opinions in these cases, I have been trying to make a summary of what each of the justices in the last 15 years have done in the various cases and quite frankly, and I say it with some apology, there is really no complete consistency among the views of the justices and among some of the justices' own views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.570" offset="9873638">They say one thing one time, they say something else another time and they come back and they end up with a somewhat different view that they had even the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.514" offset="9917419">And again, I say it with apology, but this is really the problem and I think the Court recognized the problem, I think the Court sees that it has to resolve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.454" offset="9953155">Now, throughout the country today, all of the courts are viewing the whole question of obscenity with the three-prong test as being the applicable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.945" offset="10023163">While I have read every case on this subject and I have yet to find where a majority of the court has agreed on the three-prong test, the majority of any court has agreed on the three-pronged test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.185" offset="10068093">Mr. Justice Brennan introduced the three-prong test in Memoirs and came out with the socially utterly without social redeeming value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.826" offset="10106650">But there hasn't been majority of the court that has subscribed to this as the viable concept and the principle that shall be applied in decision such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.157" offset="10155969">What is the test?</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.048" offset="10163597">I think the answer is what Mr. Justice Harlan has suggested and which I believe has been generally adopted by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun and to somewhat lesser extent by Mr. Justice White and that is that we've got to let the state if they use a rational basis in making a determination, we have got to let the states determine what is obscene and whether there has been a violation of that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.073" offset="10271640">This is the only way we're going to make any sense out of it and it's the only way we're going to end up the clogging of the courts with these cases coming in day in and day out all over the United States whether we're talking about federal courts or whether we're talking about state courts, whether we're talking at the lower level or whether we're talking at the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.607" offset="10341752">We have today the greatest backlog in cases in the criminal field throughout all of the courts of the United States and because of the inability of the court to come to some reasonable definition of what constitutes obscenity that the states have a right to control, because of that, we are causing all of these criminals or these ones that have been charged with being criminal to languish in jail waiting for these other cases to be heard and to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.731" offset="10442271">Quite frankly, I know that some will criticize me for what I'm about to say, but I would rather see the whole law abolished than to have this state of confusion continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.504" offset="10489396">I think it serves no good purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.645" offset="10497964">I think however that the public has a right based upon the acts of the legislature to have some protection in the field of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.356" offset="10532760">I think this Court has said that it has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.395" offset="10540910">In Roth, it said that obscenity is not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.181" offset="10564106">I believe it is correct, I believe it will be a sad day if it is ever the view of this Court that obscenity can run rampant and nobody can do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.489" offset="10605380">Now, let's talk for a minute about the difference between censorship in books, obscenity in books and obscenities --</text>
