            <label>Mr. Don H. Reuben</label>
            <text syncTime="22.838" offset="194748">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.769" offset="206451">This suit for libel had its inception in a raid led by the respondent on the Westside Apartment of a black family in the City of Chicago in the year 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.245" offset="264338">The family's name was Monroe and at that time the respondent was the Deputy Chief of Detectives of the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.973" offset="303313">Shortly after the raid, the Monroe family brought an action in the Federal District Court of Chicago, alleging that the raiding party and specifically that the respondent, Captain Pape broke the doors down, woke the Monroe couple with flashlights, forced them at gunpoint to leave their bed and stand naked in the center of the living room, roused the six children that were in the apartment at that time, herded them into the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.078" offset="423685">That the respondent struck Mr. Monroe several times with his flashlight, calling him nigger and black boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.499" offset="449390">That another officer pushed Mrs. Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.481" offset="461302">That the children were hit and kicked and that the police ransacked every room, throwing clothing from closets to the floor, dumping drawers and ripping mattress covers and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.226" offset="508322">The cause ultimately reached this Court and this Court held in 1961 in Monroe versus Pape that a cause of action was stated on behalf of Monroe and against Captain Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.878" offset="566836">Then in November of 1961, the Civil Rights Commission issued it's Fifth Report which it had entitled “Justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="127.473" offset="613230">Pertinent excerpts of justice appear in Appendix 323.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.807" offset="642591">Chapter 2 of “Justice” deals with police violence and is headed “Unlawful Police Violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="143.684" offset="678118">The Commission says, in Chapter 2, that the allegations of misconduct are supported in several cases by criminal convictions or findings by impartial agencies, in others by sworn testimony, affidavit from an eye witness, or by staff field investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.340" offset="760769">In no case, as the Commission determined conclusively, whether the complaints of the officers were correct in their statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.327" offset="788668">This is the function of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.811" offset="794624">The Commission said “It was of the opinion that the allegations appeared substantial enough to justify discussion in this study.”</text>
            <text syncTime="183.448" offset="837151">There was a heading “Patterns of Police Brutalities,” a sub heading “Enforcement of segregation or subordinate status,” punishment; third, the third degree in coercion of confessions and the forth section was initial contact and arrest and under the heading “Search, seizure and violence: Chicago 1958,” the Commission discussed the case or the actions of Captain Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.528" offset="949478">The Commission did so by using the language of the dissent of Justice Frankfurter in Monroe versus Pape and the Commission's lead was to say, the Supreme Court of the United State's decided the case of Monroe versus Pape on February 20, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.110" offset="1035786">Although this decision did not finally dispose of the case, it did permit the plaintiff to sue several Chicago police officers for violation of the Federal Civil Rights Act on the basis of a compliant which alleged that and then Justice Frankfurter's opinion was quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.177" offset="1112064">Time Incorporated, upon receiving the Commission report, wrote an article and published it in the ensuing edition of Time.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.644" offset="1157935">That article appears in hike verb (ph) in our brief at page 8, it's called “Civil Rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.031" offset="1195447">The respondent sued for libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.091" offset="1211747">The case was decided by the district judge on motion prior to this Court's decision in New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.578" offset="1241736">The district judge dismissed the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.727" offset="1254275">The Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.153" offset="1271933">Thereafter when the case was remanded, the plaintiff's position -- Captain Pape's position was taken, the Court's decision in New York Times had come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.390" offset="1312893">A motion for summary judgment was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.988" offset="1323342">It was granted on the basis of New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.022" offset="1335463">The case went back to the Court of Appeals, was again reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.988" offset="1355316">The third time when the case was remanded, the District Court empaneled a jury and a full hearing was had and the pertinent evidence to this cause shows that the author or the man that originally wrote the story, dropped the word “alleged” or did not indicate in his reporting of the event that this material that came from the Civil Rights Commission Report was in turn a statement of Justice Frankfurter's statement of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.245" offset="1520306">He was asked specifically and it is at page 12 of our brief and it's appendix 208 and 209, why he dropped the word “alleged” and he said, the word “alleged” cannot be taken just in that context. It has to be taken in the context of the entire chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.601" offset="1613824">He says “It means to me that the Commission in this case is reporting this instance in terms of a claim being made in a court by the Monroes, but you can't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.373" offset="1656874">In the context of the entire chapter, it is not a simple allegation because the Commission has also said that we will not include just an allegation that we have not verified in some fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.036" offset="3391509">Well, I think that the best answer to that is to review what Time did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.625" offset="3413870">Mr. Magnuson whose testimony I read, the Court indicated that he thought from a reading of the Civil Rights Commission report as a whole that this was as he said “There's more an allegation of a complaint being reported here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="844.127" offset="3479907">Additionally after the article was written and I think the Court has to look at this article as though it was uttered by Time Incorporated, you have to look at the whole editorial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.321" offset="3528704">The article was sent to a research department and the morgue on Captain Pape or the reference file which they had was taken by an independent researcher and there was discovered a number of material on Monroe versus Pape, including a New York Post article which is in the record and including a Time Zone in-house dispatches which indicated that the incidents reported by the Civil Rights Commission in the words of Justice Frankfurter were true and the combination of the researcher's independent judgment plus the editor's judgment plus the writer's judgment resulted in an editorial decision, in an editorial decision to publish this material in the form that's before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.845" offset="3750745">And in the New York Times case and in the St. Amant case, the test is of actual malice is whether there was a publication made by one who published knowing it was false and intending to do harm through falsehood or as Justice White said in St. Amant, “A high degree of awareness of falsity and nevertheless publishing, intending to do harm by publishing falsehood.”</text>
            <text syncTime="945.602" offset="3885746">There is not one thing in this record that indicates that this author or this researcher or Time Incorporated had any knowledge of falsity or had any awareness of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.892" offset="3942902">Rather what we believe and what the District Judge held and what two judges or at least the first dissenting Circuit Court judge held was that a fair reading of the Civil Rights material alone could lead to the conclusion that the report about Pape in the Civil Rights Commission was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.310" offset="4044570">And I suggest if you read the dissent in the first Pape case, decided pre-New York Times and you see there a Court of Appeals Judge, looking at the four corners of justice and saying to -- in his dissent that a reasonable person could read “Justice” and conclude that Times report was an accurate report of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.420" offset="4145089">That if an independent judgment like that can be made, then it's passing strange to say that the author had either knowledge of falsity in reading “Justice” when -- or had a high degree of awareness of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.919" offset="4215097">Now, the Seventh Circuit which reversed Judge Robson's holding that to allow this case to go to the jury would have a chilling effect on the First Amendment, singled out, singled out the word “alleged” or the dropping of the word “alleged” and on that basis, and on that basis alone held that the case had to go to the jury on the issue of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.470" offset="4317288">It was that single facet that prompted every reversal and what you see, I submit to Your Honors, is an ability by any court in the country to give lip service to Your Honor's decisions in New York Times and its progeny St. Amant and the cases in between and nevertheless within the framework of giving all of the Pi's (ph) utterances possible to New York Times to hold that a libel occurred or that actual malice occurred by singling out one factor and what -- there are at least three vices in what the Court of Appeals did and what occurred here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.410" offset="10332975">First of all, Time wasn't reporting its own judgment on the incident of Pape versus Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.690" offset="10362128">It was rather reporting so it says, what a Commission found is something different, that's first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.874" offset="10394833">They could certainly, good faith wise, make an investigation, do whatever they care to do, of course, using the facilities and I hope talking to somebody, I hope to talking to -- I hope at least talk to somebody who was at the incident but certainly if they investigated and they went out there, they talk to Monroe, they talk to Pape, or if they talk to anybody that might have been present, they can say anything they want as far as I am concerned and as far as Pape is concerned about the Monroe incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.284" offset="10524505">So they could answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.584" offset="10529729">They surely could come in and say, there was –- there was on such such a day a Campbell Park (ph) an incident where a police officer came in and beat up, beat a -- beat a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.620" offset="10589811">They could simply this even though it was not true they could say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.362" offset="10608828">So long as they did something and had some basis for saying that they talked to people, they have made a judgment, made an investigation and did something.</text>
