            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear argument in number 420, McDaniel against Barresi.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene A. Epting</label>
            <text syncTime="47.883" offset="294954">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.322" offset="316688">I think the Court will find that this case is somewhat unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.262" offset="344377">I would venture to say that in most, if not all, of the cases before this Court involving Boards of Education, the Board has been here either complaining that it should not be required to do what its been told and asked to do or defending itself, in claiming that it has done all that it's required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.229" offset="448240">Here you have the Board of Education defending itself against the charge that it’s doing too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.456" offset="489200">In other words, Clarke County Board of Education has tried to avoid the entanglement of federal court decisions in regard to the question of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.584" offset="557746">So far it has succeeded and when I hear and read the arguments in regard to the tribulations of Charlotte and Mobil and Clarksdale, Bessemer, Jefferson, I think they have acted wisely on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.146" offset="651995">But, we have come to the proposition where having avoided entanglement and federal court authors running our of schools, we find ourselves faced with as a state court injunction that says, we can’t do what we have done, because in undertaking to honor the Fourteenth Amendment Rights of some people, we are thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment Rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.271" offset="804446">Now, I would agree with the tenner of the arguments in Charlotte that all of these busing of students from one community to another is not in the best interest of the education is that -- if I understand one of their points correctly, but in the Clarke County case, we are not dealing where the Court ordered busing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.495" offset="917400">We are dealing with what has been called pocket busing to a limited extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.339" offset="944776">We are small school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.289" offset="952508">We have only 11,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.652" offset="965987">We have only 15 elementary students.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.691" offset="986154">We call it pocket busing, in Charlotte they called it “Satellite Zoning,” but it means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.644" offset="1025964">In undertaking to pocket bus and if the Court wishes to look at the record, I think you will see a map on page 174 that shows the geographical locations of these pockets of students who were bused to schools which were formally, predominantly of the other race.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.892" offset="1146964">If you will look at page 167, you will see the chart of a neighborhood plan which was best adopted by this Court, and which shows the extent, the chart on the map shows the extent of racial mixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.363" offset="1220838">When we talk about desegregation and racial balance and integration, when we get it all down to a common denominator, we are talking about mixing the races in the school, that’s what it amounts to in plain simple language.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.343" offset="1312789">The Board felt that under the judge -- the decisions of this Court and particularly the decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court, we were compelled to do it.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="335.683" stopTime="337.963">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="335.683" offset="1446118">I mean, in terms of the power of the board on its own to do something?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_a_epting" startTime="337.963" stopTime="449.109">
            <label>Mr. Eugene A. Epting</label>
            <text syncTime="337.963" offset="1455208">Yes sir, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.165" offset="1463986">Now, it is our position that when this Court decided Brown II, this Court said that there was a duty on the Boards of Education to do something more than back off from state order of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.260" offset="1556459">Brown I had already said that and if that was all we required to do is stop segregating by law then we didn’t need Brown II and we didn’t need Copper versus Aaron, and we didn’t need Green versus New Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.256" offset="1620407">Brown I had already said that’s unconstitutional, but when this Court said in Brown II, we’re going to give you some -- in effect some guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.299" offset="1664606">We’re going to tell you what you’ve got to do to disestablish the existing systems and then it followed with such things as Copper versus Aaron which says you’ve got to take steps to eliminate formally segregated school system, root and branch, and when it comes along with Green versus New Kent County of course number of years later and says, the Boards of Education have the affirmative duty to take whatever action is necessary to disestablish the dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.519" offset="1805458">That clearly calls for some affirmative move, not just backing off and leave things as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.491" offset="1833357">That’s the way we’ve interpreted the decision and that’s the way the Fifth Circuit interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.562" offset="1853628">Maybe the Fifth Circuit isn't the final word, but we are in the Fifth Circuit and we have to honor its decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="449.109" stopTime="451.952">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="449.109" offset="1899813">We are in the Fifth Circuit.[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_a_epting" startTime="451.952" stopTime="1082.445">
            <label>Mr. Eugene A. Epting</label>
            <text syncTime="451.952" offset="1911202">Consequently some plan had to be formed that would eliminate the mix -- the separation in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.152" offset="1979956">Now, a neighborhood plan and if this Court would say that all that a school board is required to do is zone without discrimination as to race and setup a neighborhood plan, we can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.096" offset="2047770">But we’ll have some black schools and we’ll have some white schools with -- well, we had one with 525 whites and 20 blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.229" offset="2088312">We had another one with approximately 500 whites and 19 blacks because a neighborhoods are made up that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.266" offset="2132407">So, as I say the result of our efforts is that in -- and we had some five to four decisions in that Board or rather six to five and we are not unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.833" offset="2190712">But, our decision was that the most feasible way or most reasonable way as those who preceded me have discussed Mr. Griswold I believe, was to zone and pick up an area that is not contiguous to the zone and take the children from that area to the zone schools, frankly in order to accomplish what we understand is our affirmative duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.770" offset="2366464">Now, you -- it might be said well you could zone in such a way as to bring in substantial numbers of both races.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.349" offset="2420799">The pattern in our -- this is a County wide system, it involves not only the City of Athens, but the entire County.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.782" offset="2458520">The pattern of housing, the racial distribution is such that when you step out to pick in, pick up another alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.983" offset="2495300">You pick up more of what we might call the wrong race then you do of the race that you’re trying to get in, so that won’t wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.886" offset="2554964">We were told too that it might be possible to break the school system down into a different plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.671" offset="2590072">Have the first three grades or the first four grades certain schools, have the fifth and sixth or the fourth, fifth, and sixth in other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.726" offset="2634271">When you do that, you’re going to bus over the entire County because you’ve got to have a bus route that covers the entire County for each of two separate sets of school and you’re going to pick up the young children, the first graders from an area adjacent to what is now a school that accommodates them and take them off to some other school.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.790" offset="2734582">And you are going to have to go over to the other school and bring back some fourth, fifth, and sixth graders, or fifth and sixth whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.764" offset="2762480">Bring them from next door to a school over to one that accommodates that grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.756" offset="2798425">So we decided, the board decided, that this pocket busing was the most feasible way of working out the problem within the means that this board has.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.897" offset="2874911">Now, it happens that no plaintiff in the lower court and by the way I assume this Court has the information as to how this thing proceeded, that an injunction suit or two injunction suits were filed in the Superior Court of Clarke County, injunctions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.401" offset="2973027">The people, the plaintiffs then appeal to Supreme Court of Georgia and the Supreme Court of Georgia says, that in taking students of one race into a school that is predominately of the other race is that, that’s discrimination for the purpose that is of achieving racial balance, that is discrimination and taking then people out of that school in order to make room for those you brought in as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Rights of those taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.938" offset="3151078">Now, it happens that nobody included in any of these four of the five pockets, four pockets, that are being bused to a more distant school, not one of those passengers of party to these law suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.427" offset="3225057">The people who are being pocket bused are not complaining, not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.020" offset="3259434">When you pocket bus Ohio where you arrange to take students to a school that’s already filled to capacity, you have to take somebody out of that school in order to make room for those who are brought in, it’s that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.786" offset="3330487">The result was that we had -- the Board had to rezone the area set by that particular school or those particular schools, not on a basis of excluding whites but realigning the zones so that the students in those areas went to a different school.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.414" offset="3432991">We had to make room for those are brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.842" offset="3450755">If the Georgia Court is right in saying that by rezoning in order to accommodate those brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.115" offset="3487848">Then there are no courses left open to a Board of Education except the freedom of choice or a strict neighborhood zone, living the racial composition to stand or fall on zone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.654" offset="3550020">I do not understand that this Court has given us that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.021" offset="3579486">I do understand that the Fifth Circuit Courts have said we can’t do that in Jefferson.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.789" offset="3614490">I think that was the effect of one of the decisions in Mobil.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.872" offset="3634866">I think that was the certainly effect of the decision in the Indianola case which obviously was is an extreme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.929" offset="3671124">I think that was the effect in Clarke State.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.156" offset="3687946">So, this Board has done what its ordered it had to do under the decisions of this Court and the Courts of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.876" offset="3742908">Brown II and the decisions following it require affirmative action by the school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.743" offset="3774360">New Kent County and that was followed in Rene and Monroe called for the same affirmative duty and in Monroe whereas the board had a zone plan with a free transport provision, the Court plainly held that the affirmative duty was not satisfied by a neighborhood zone plan unless it resulted in the substantial mixing of races in all of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.128" offset="3903927">Now, we in Clarke County have frankly, we have gerrymandered zone not to achieve, not to retain segregation, but to try to do just the opposite, to try to make some in the schools, to avoid the entanglements that were consequent upon maintaining a segregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.666" offset="4010088">We obviously had dual system prior to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.551" offset="4033599">We begin the process of eliminating that in 1959 with one of the transfer plans which were sort of the vogue in South then.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.803" offset="4094621">In 1963, prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we had our first integration in Clarke County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.196" offset="4136208">Subsequent to that, we have followed various methods in trying to get our system -- keep our system in line with the law as we understood it, but we can’t compete with the decisions of one Court saying go one way and the decisions of another Court saying, go another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.608" offset="4233801">We have to know where to go and this decision and this question in this Court is a simple question but its answer involves tremendous problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.444" offset="4305168">If this Court should say, you have complied with the law when you create neighborhood schools that’s alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.372" offset="4344874">But, if this Court meant what it said when it said, you have an affirmative duty to take whatever action is necessary to disestablish the dual system then, we think this Court would have to uphold the action which is taken by Clarke County Board of Education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.104" offset="4963767">Now, the next point that I would like to mention on the -- regard to the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court is after saying that the action of Clarke County Board of Education in the adoption of its plan violated to Fourteenth Amendment Rights of those students who were required to go to a different zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.213" offset="5068257">It says also that its action violates those provisions of the Civil Rights Act dealing with the definition of desegregation 407, and 2000 (c) and 2000 (d) (6), I believe, which says, that desegregation shall not mean on as used in this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.608" offset="5181837">Desegregation shall not mean busing to achieve a racial balance and in the second Section the 2000 (c) (6), the code antedated, that no Court or public by or public body -- federal body, I believe I forget the exact language, shall be authorized by this Act to require busing to achieve racial balance in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.148" offset="5300015">Now, as used in that Act and I think it was best stated in the Olsen case in the District Court of New York, that pertains to the use of funds under that Section -- of that title of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.641" offset="5373889">Whatever Congress may have meant to say, it isn’t -- didn’t put a restriction on the discretionary action of Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.006" offset="5423417">The Georgia Court says, that the action of this Board violates the provisions of that Section of the Civil Rights Act and I don’t think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.490" offset="5469288">I think that part of a decision is also in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.776" offset="5502516">The problem that we have is the basic problem which faces this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.678" offset="5570121">What exactly is a School board required to do and what can the School board do in order to meet its obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.533" offset="5617455">Obviously, when you honor the rights of some if they have rights in regard to where they attend the school, you are going to change the exercise of the rights of others where your school system is filled to capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.435" offset="5701151">I would like to call this point to the attention of the -- it’s in the record, but the attention of Court in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.002" offset="5731349">The people except for three who have children who walk from one zone to a school in another, both within a mile and hour -- within the mile-and-half both schools, except for those three, the other plaintiffs in the trial Court and the appellants in the Supreme Court of Georgia, those people were sent to a school that had been used the previous year to house a particular -- the student from a particular neighborhood, who had to be bused to that school because the school in their neighborhood was under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.466" offset="5933223">Consequently, when we added the school, 69 school year and the school in that particular neighborhood, the new school had been completed, we had a substantially empty school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.216" offset="5992260">We had to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.838" offset="6002709">We used it by zoning the contagious area that involves these plaintiffs here, these respondents here, but plaintiffs in the court below by bringing them to that school with the exception of two or three, they had to be bused somewhere and it was logical to bus in to the school where the space was available, and that was what this Board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.660" offset="6106049">That’s one of the little details that only a Board can solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.009" offset="6127365">We ask this Court therefore to uphold this board in the exercise of its discretion and reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia which seems to curtail our exercise of that discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.096" offset="6207718">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.443" offset="6221093">I’d like to direct some remarks at the outset to some tests that have been proposed here and then deal specifically with the contentions of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.823" offset="6262680">Four different tests as I understand it, have been proposed by the counsel in the cases that have been argued here yesterday and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.431" offset="6301132">The Fifth Circuit itself has postulated a rule which declares that the duty of each system to prevent the existence of an old black school, it quote reasonable alternatives exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.348" offset="6356720">When all black schools do exist, the Fifth Circuit has said that the State of a system must specify valid reasons for those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.367" offset="6400815">Further, the Fifth Circuit draws a distinction between not only between the jury and de facto systems, but in addition, it draws a distinction between urban systems on the one hand and rural systems on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.723" offset="6462255">This is indicated from its decisions in the Orange County in Hillsboro cases on the one hand, involving urban systems and its decision in the Monroe Louisiana case, involving a rule system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.818" offset="6514604">Now, the Fourth Circuit has postulated a rule in the Charlotte case in terms of whether the all black schools are capable of abolition by reasonable means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.158" offset="6559953">The Justice Department in its brief refers to a rule of feasibility which seems to be taken from the Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.062" offset="6599659">The petitioners in Charlotte and in Mobil cases on the other hand, had stated a point blank requirement that, “Every black child is to be free from assignment to a black school, an identifiable racial minority school at every grade, subject only to this qualification” in the case of “absolute on work ability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.426" offset="6701119">Now, apparently this exception is aimed that such places as Washington and New York where it would be physically impossible to bring about a realization of what they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.414" offset="6749080">We submit in this case that all of these tests miss the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.108" offset="6771754">They involve standards which differ only and only in degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.031" offset="6791502">Under them, the sufficiency of a plan is made to depend upon a statistical appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.398" offset="6824939">They involve Court formulated test which we submit if any state legislature had attempted to enact would have immediately been declared unconstitutional by this Court as being void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.912" offset="6879065">We submit that they invite another generation of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.786" offset="6898500">They either avoid or assume without acknowledging it, a determination of the basic question which lurks in all of these cases that have been argued thus far and that is what does the Constitution require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.769" offset="6958477">What did you mean in Brown?</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.868" offset="6970807">Does the Constitution simply prohibit state enforced discrimination or does it require an actual integration of the races in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.994" offset="7011349">Now, the problem it seems to me, with the position of the Government and the position that the petitioners in this case have to take is that they seem to assume that the Constitution does require integration except where it’s not reasonable, where it’s not feasible or whether it’s absolutely unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.065" offset="7091597">Now, this we submit is inconsistent because it makes the scope of a constitutional right depend upon the readily availability of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.913" offset="7135065">And it would make the rights of a minority child differ in places such as New York and Atlanta or in Charlotte, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.569" offset="7173622">The position of respondents and they are both black and white respondents, I think the Court probably is aware then in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.379" offset="7200893">They were both black and white parents that were objecting to being assigned on the basis of race in order to bring about this 20% to 40% ratio on each school that the petitioners were seeking implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.894" offset="7258990">Our position is simply that the constitution does not require affirmative state enforced integration, but that it only prohibits state enforced segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.265" offset="7308413">So being we say that the assignment of children to achieve racial balancing is not required, but is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.849" offset="7342791">Consequently, the majority to minority transfer option has been discussed, we submit that also is not valid anymore and the minority to majority transfer option struck down in (Inaudible) is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.840" offset="7402768">And secondly, Mr. Justice White, I don’t think it’s involved in this case for reasons that I will get to, and we -- but we submit that a state or a Board of Education cannot own its own policy determination in an effort to alleviate de facto or whatever you call it, racial balance, undertake to affirmatively assigned students on the basis of race in order to bring about a racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.568" offset="7517602">Now, I will attempt to show later on that that is not involved in this case because the Clarke County Board of Education was not acting voluntarily, but according to the testimony of it superintendent at page 97 of the record, he said, we are acting because we are under compulsion of HEW, they are about to cut off the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.629" offset="10185853">It was assumed, for example after Briggs versus Elliot for a long time and this is going back in ancient history, and perhaps its difficult to visualize that this was once assumed to be possible, but you have the pupil placement plans that said that students remain where they are albeit they were putted there on a racial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.902" offset="10274983">But they are permitted to transfer out by meeting a list of 17 criteria that were set out in the Shuttlesworth case and this Court upheld that in the late 50’s or the early 60’s, I’m not sure of which.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.870" offset="10330885">Well, the law as evolved and as the Court of Appeals said in the Charlotte case to say that the same law is in effect in 1969 or 1968 that the Courts, including the Courts of Appeals assume was the law in 1955 is simply missing the point because it’s not sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.135" offset="10415940">The concepts in this area have changed and I’m not saying that they shouldn't have changed, I’m simply saying that what a system did not do in 1955 should not indict it at this time on the basis of requirements that we feel have been imposed only by decisions starting in about 1967 in the Fifth Circuit in the Jefferson and in the Green case in 1968.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.380" offset="10560867">The old basis in most southern school districts was a neighborhood plan except you had dual zones, you had one for black and one for white.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.226" offset="10684270">Could on the other hand, go to a pure uninhibited freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.041" offset="10711542">Now, the problem in Green and the other cases is that the choice was not free and we have attempted to distinguish those cases in our brief at page 29, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.434" offset="10761070">Now all three of them and show that in each instance, the free choice plans involved in those three systems continued to make initial assignments in one form or another of students on the basis of race and then put the burden on them to get out of it.</text>
