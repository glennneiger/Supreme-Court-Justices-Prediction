            <text syncTime="631.123" offset="2628921">Now, the posture of this controversy, by reason of the fact that the Court below did not pass upon the basic issue which we presented, we had a trial in which we sought to present evidence with respect to four institutions in Connecticut, all Catholic, to show primarily to present to create a record as to what might be deemed sectarian and what might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.222" offset="2757235">We had precedent for that in State Court in Maryland just two or three years ago. there were four institutions which were challenged under a similar statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="693.990" offset="2880324">Basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.879" offset="2915955">The Court below took the position that under the statute, and this was a position urged by the government and this is the position-- this is the interpretation that the Commissioner has applied throughout the nation, that it is completely irrelevant as to what the beneficiary institution is, what it was created for, what its purpose is, what its practice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.807" offset="3007592">The sole test both as to meaning and as to constitutionality is whether the particular facility to which the federal funds have earmarked, whether that particular facility is not used either for sectarian instruction or religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.391" offset="3101947">If that facility, an island of secularity surrounded by a sea of sectarianism, is clear of religion, then it matters not what the sea is and, therefore, the Court found that in finding of fact, the only finding of facts make laws that we presented no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.263" offset="3185434">Indeed, we do not contend, we did not contest the fact that these four institutions, the facilities which were financed in part with federal funds, were not used for religious instruction or religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.668" offset="3243112">Indeed, the evidence showed there was no crucifixes there, no religious images, that they were completely secular.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.197" offset="3269235">And, the Court below, adopting the government's position, simply disregard and felt -- deemed irrelevant all the evidence presented as to the nature of these institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.329" offset="3321689">Now on the basis of that, the Court, in effect, held this.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.021" offset="3364530">This is a fair conclusion, I believe, of what the Court has held and what the government contends that it is perfectly constitutional for the government to appropriate funds for building facilities and, I want to interrupt for one moment, the current facilities that had been interpreted by the Commissioner quite broadly, doesn't mean necessarily a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.673" offset="3471109">A library or a chemistry laboratory in a building, the rest of the building, which is committed and devoted to religious teaching, so long as that library itself is not used for that purpose, that library can be financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.136" offset="3532967">Now, an institution which admits only students of a particular religion, requires them to participate in religious activities, compels them to comply with the doctrines and documents of the religion, forces them to attend church, requires them under penalty of dismissal to take instruction in the theology and doctrines of that religion, and does everything to propagate and advance a particular religion other than conferred degrees in divinity, that such an institution can constitutionally receive governmental funds so long as, in its bookkeeping, it allocates those funds to the construction of a chemistry laboratory or a biology classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.207" offset="3713212">This is the crux of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.290" offset="3729512">I cannot see how the Constitution of the United States which forbids a religious test for public office, nevertheless, permits the financing of public facilities which are barred to anybody but members of a particular religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.378" offset="4717881">That's why we're in Court, or else we wouldn't be in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.830" offset="4735749">But leaving aside any further discussions of constitutionality, how could we just inextricably wound up with constitutionality, we claim that it is part of the Constitutional law of the United States and of all the states in the Union that public funds may not be used to finance the operation and construction of an institution, a sectarian institution, of a type which we have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.306" offset="4845672">We believe that is a principle which is as -- might be said to be part of the common law of the American Constitutional System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.649" offset="4882975">It was given its most, perhaps, broadest pronouncement in the Everson case in 1947 in upholding bus transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.634" offset="4938982">The Everson case, a 5:4 split, was -- would've meant nothing if there were not agreement that you could not finance the operations of the institution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.208" offset="5005228">The Everson principle has been criticized because of the term “no aid” is too broad in this Court, and it also suggested that may be too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.298" offset="5037620">The Everson principle is not a no-aid principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.584" offset="5054757">The Everson principle is no subsidy principle, and the Court distinguished it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.493" offset="5078371">It distinguished it in Walz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.618" offset="5082864">It distinguished in Allan, the textbook case, between aiding an institution which the government does many times and subsidizing it, financing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.895" offset="5131975">That, what we contend, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.919" offset="5148066">Now, we have said in our brief, as the government takes exemption to it, that we have been able to find in the history of the United States a precedent to this Higher Educational Facilities Act of 1963, for governmental financing the construction operations of a sectarian institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.467" offset="5230299">The government says, ever since-- in their brief, ever since the Moral Act, the Land Grant Act of 1962, the government has financed church-related institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.556" offset="5286619">We've said sectarian and gives us evidence for that, support, for that assertion a study made by the Brazilian Library of Congress which is reported in the congressional record, listing the educational institutions, church-related educational institutions which have received Land Grant funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.759" offset="5375436">I should like to, with the brief list, I should like to list-- read you the list of, I think, less than a dozen institutions which are cited in support of this assertion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.571" offset="5526632">To the naked eye, I assume one would not suspect Kansas State University to be church-related, but this government says it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.112" offset="5552859">It reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.984" offset="5556308">Kansas State University: Methodist church gave Bluemont Central College to state as site for new agricultural college which was to receive Land Grant funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.552" offset="5610642">The Kansas State Agricultural College became the state university.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.292" offset="5625584">This is the whole comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.672" offset="5631122">Ergo, it follows that the government has given money to a church related college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.950" offset="5652229">I submit, Your Honors, if this proves anything, it proves the opposite of what the government decided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.749" offset="5679397">It proves the recognition that Bluemont College, so long as it was part of the Methodist church, could not receive government funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.839" offset="5715759">So, what was done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.818" offset="5719625">A gift that was made to a state university of the State of Kansas, the State of Kansas made a public institution and it received funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.775" offset="5751495">This is, I submit, an argument which does not stand strongly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.388" offset="5785976">Now, I recognize that the Everson decision is a decision of this Court and what this Court gives, this Court can take away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.403" offset="5825996">And, if the Everson principle is dead, perhaps this Court should say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.755" offset="5847416">My argument is that the Court has not said so, that notwithstanding the criticism and it is legion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.520" offset="5870508">There's hardly law reviews in the country which is said to have from time to time, now for showing how broad the Everson dictum is and criticizing for its over breath, but the supreme judiciary body of the United States is not the law reviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.927" offset="5932053">It's not the briefs of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.227" offset="5937277">It is this Court, and I submit that this Court has not in any way impaired the integrity of the basic principle of Everson of no financing of sectarian institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.823" offset="6819694">Bradfield against Roberts was an 1899 decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a contract between the City of Washington and a corporation formed by an order of nuns to operate the Providence Hospital in the City of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.171" offset="6917078">The Court held the statute constitutional on two basic concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.087" offset="6952709">First, that there was nothing sectarian in the operation of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.602" offset="6974757">This hospital, as the Court said, is operated according to its charter and it is not the hospital which operates -- which treats ill people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.179" offset="7009134">It does not teach, it does not propagate religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.506" offset="7022404">Within the term of “sectarian” as we've used in this case, it is not a sectarian institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.865" offset="7039854">The Court indicated that as a separate corporation, but I don't think that's the critical factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.011" offset="7064409">I think the law pierces a corporate veil to prevent fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.165" offset="7081023">I think the law would pierce a corporate veil to prevent violation of the First Amendment, but the critical factor is not whether this is a legal fiction, a separate corporation, but whether this is in truth and in fact an institution which propagates and practice religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.109" offset="7148837">It says it does not propagate -- propagates blessing and teaches-- it teaches medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.535" offset="7170570">Secondly, here's another critical distinction, the Court pointed out that no person is denied admission and treatment to that hospital because of the religion or faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.658" offset="7214979">It does not limit it to the members of that faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.515" offset="7226472">It said, indeed, it had to be because, as part of its contract with the City of Washington, it had to take indigent patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.431" offset="7258133">Now, I submit to you that a state cannot make a contract -- a federal government can't make a contract with a sectarian educational institution of the type of this kind whereby the state will pay that institution money and send its students there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.924" offset="7320095">It can do it with a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.559" offset="7330649">But, the institution has a right to say, indeed, it has a constitutional right to say “under the Religious Liberty Clause, we will not admit anybody here unless he's part of our faith and, indeed, if he is part of our faith, as the record shows, he must take Catholic Theology or Lutheran Theology, must go to mass or to communion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.232" offset="7397313">This is a condition which a sectarian institution has, under the Free Exercise Clause an absolute right to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.504" offset="13082394">The Higher Educational Facilities Act of 1963 rests on findings by Congress that, at that time, there was an urgent need for a tremendous expansion of the higher educational facilities in the United States and, in order to enable the young people of this country to obtain an education which they needed and which held out great promise for the future, the provision in Title I for grants to educational institutions only permits grants upon a determination that the grant will result in the creation of urgently needed expansion of facilities which will increase enrollment of the colleges so that the critical fact of this statute is that it was designed in order to enable this country to expand its higher educational facilities at a time when existing facilities were inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.748" offset="13355426">Now the statute, as Mr. Pfeffer has indicated, is very explicit that no federal grants may be made for any facility which is used for sectarian instruction or sectarian worship and in addition, no grant may be made for any facility which is whole or part of a school of divinity, and school of divinity in turn, is defined very broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.235" offset="13465349">It's defined as a school for the education of students to prepare them to become ministers of religion or to enter upon some other religious vocation or to prepare them to teach theological subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3854.919" offset="15524112">I think that Catholic students are required in some instances to take certain courses and again, however, these courses are not taught exclusively by Catholic teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.429" offset="15570087">Almost every one of the schools, for example, has a rabbi on the staff and, interestingly enough, the rabbi is not restricted to teaching Jewish theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.241" offset="15609375">He is to -- in Jewish religion, he teach -- one of the rabbis teaches a basic course in introductory survey of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.262" offset="15637483">Now, I would like, if I may, just briefly to refer to the contention of appellants that the statute doesn't apply to these, doesn't permit these grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.791" offset="15679592">That is, that the statute is silent on the type of institutions that may receive grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.721" offset="15699237">All that it speaks about is it permits grants to institutions of higher education and, that, seems to me a neutral thing, but the qualifications that the statute creates for the receipt of these grants is based on the academic situation of the school, not upon its religious affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.195" offset="15777186">However, the language of the statue strongly suggests that Congress recognized that grants would be made to church-affiliated, religiously affiliated institutions because of the specific exception for grants to divinity schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.441" offset="15854195">Now, it's common knowledge that most divinity schools are operated by religiously affiliated institutions and when Congress specifically accepts from the permissible category of institutions that may receive these construction grants, divinity schools, it seems to me it is a very clear implication that grants are permitted for non-divinity school aspects of these church-related institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.672" offset="15951057">But if there's any question about this, I think it's completely dispelled by the legislative history in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3976.414" offset="16010094">What I suggested is the existence of that exception is rather strong evidence, we think, that Congress recognized that grants could be made to non-divinity school institutions that were connected with religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.255" offset="16073415">But, the legislative history on this, it seems to me, is really clear beyond any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.905" offset="16095984">First of all, there are a number of people who testified during the course of the debates in Congress that in order to accomplish the necessary expansion of the educational facilities, the private non-religiously affiliated and the public higher education institutions in this country would not be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.865" offset="16183860">They'd need to have to call upon the existing facilities of the religious institutions, and while it was considerable debate that during the course of this legislation over the wisdom and constitutionality of these grants, there was nobody who suggested that the statute did not cover grants to these institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.487" offset="16258361">Indeed, it's exactly to the opposite because several of the sponsors of the legislation explicitly stated during the course of the debate that this statute does cover religiously affiliated institutions and, indeed, in both the House and the Senate, an amendment was proposed that would've excluded grants to religiously affiliated institutions and that amendment was defeated by a voice vote -- tele vote in both instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="4579.619" offset="18422868">In the same year, it applied the same test in the Everson case involving the validity of the Arkansas Anti-Evolution statute and then, last year, in the Walz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.203" offset="18469157">Although it didn't quote the language of that purpose and effect test, it did use that language and cited the case at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="4605.441" offset="18526208">That is correct, Mr. Justice, and let me say with response to Mr. Pfeffer's contention that, somehow, Everson is the test and that if this Court is going to drop Everson now, it should do so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.079" offset="18576677">In the Schempp case, when the Court first annunciated the purpose and primary effect test immediately, after quoting the language which we rely on, it cited the Everson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.712" offset="18635295">So, obviously, the Court must have believed that the purpose and effect test, it was their announcing represented an application of the somewhat broader generalized principles that the Court announced in Everson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.003" offset="18696422">Now, the appellants' argument, the appellants' attack on the purpose and effect test rest almost exclusively on the notion that, somehow, the secular and the sectarian are so intertwined that any meaningful separation is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.420" offset="18774058">I think the Court crossed that bridge in the Allen case where it rejected the notion that somehow you couldn't separate the secular and the sectarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.737" offset="18811361">It recognized there that the religiously affiliated schools performed two distinct functions, and if it was felt there that there was no such permeation of the two, such intermingling of the two, when you're dealing with children in the primary and elementary schools where they're far more impressionable than to college students, certainly you cannot make that claim in this context, where we are dealing with students in college and, indeed, couple of these universities have graduate schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.258" offset="18957437">The purpose here is plainly secular.</text>

            <text syncTime="4716.250" offset="18969349">It was designed to accomplish an expansion, a desperately needed expansion of the facilities available for higher education.</text>

            <text syncTime="4791.397" offset="19269966">Now, of course, this statute, these grants obviously do help the church-affiliated institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.030" offset="19308523">They help them in much the same way that the parochial schools were aided by subsidizing the parents for the bus fares in Everson, that they are aided by paying for the books in Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.397" offset="19350006">But, the critical thing, it seems to us, is the primary effect and the primary effect here while it helps the religious schools does not constitute a forbidden government intervention, consider it an actual government support in furthering of religion as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.772" offset="19427432">The government, here, does maintain its neutral position toward religion and we think that the way this statute is structured, it does permit room for that benevolent play of the joints which this Court indicated last year in Walz as one of the essential elements under the Establishment Clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Michael Ahern</label>
            <text syncTime="4856.642" offset="19530982">I think I could finish in that time, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.308" offset="19549581">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.045" offset="19560552">Since the interest of the State of Connecticut in this case is identical to the interest of the United States government, we subscribe to the arguments advanced by the government in its briefs and in oral argument here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.358" offset="19613842">In addition, I should like to point out one or two aspects of the case, very briefly, which we think the Court should consider carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.936" offset="19644144">Now, while the appellants in this case have stated that they brought this action, they could've brought this action in any state of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.268" offset="19673506">The fact remains that they brought the action against four colleges in the State of Connecticut and named the State of Connecticut as a defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.381" offset="19705898">While we have not officially sought to represent all of the states in this matter, we feel that by being named the defendant in the case, we have been cast in the role of representative without portfolio for all of the states in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.713" offset="19771204">Incidentally, this role seems quite appropriate in this place because Connecticut is known as the Constitution State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.612" offset="19798894">I want to emphasize to the Court that each of the states in the United States are participating in this grant program and are vitally interested in seeing that federal funds continue to flow under this Act to the states to enlarge and expand educational facilities in order to accommodate the rapidly growing numbers of young people aspiring to higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.796" offset="19895547">I should also like to direct the Court's attention to the fact that, in view of the state of the congressional record, when this Act was being considered, I don't think it can be seriously contended by appellants that Congress intended to violate the Establishment Clause of the constitution by providing federal funds to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.715" offset="19979243">The congressional purpose clearly stated, in debate and in Section 701 of the Act, was to meet an educational crisis by providing funds for academic facilities to further the educational development of its citizenry which would be beneficial to the whole nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.584" offset="20050714">We submit it was to implement that national purpose that the Act was adopted, and it was to advance that purpose that the states have participated in the grant program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.307" offset="20093659">I would also like to point out that Congress evidently anticipated the recent holding of this case -- Court in the Walz decision to the effect that excessive entanglement by the government in administration of religion might make the legislation declare it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.660" offset="20171086">Under the Act under consideration here, each state was required to establish an agency for the purpose of screening grant applications and establishing priorities among projects within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.436" offset="20230123">However, the states were given no authority to adopt supplemental guidelines with respect to hiring practices or for inspection procedures subsequent to construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.753" offset="20275367">The state's responsibility and authority terminated when the application was approved and submitted to the US Commissioner of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.718" offset="20311312">In like manner, the Congress provided in Section 757 of the Act that the United States Government could not become involved in “the personnel, curriculum, methods of instruction, or administration of the colleges which received grants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.466" offset="20378290">The sole responsibility and authority of the government, after completion of construction, was to determine for a period of 20 years by on-site inspection whether the facility was being used for the purpose for which it was constructed, that is, education rather than being used for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.149" offset="20453000">Accordingly, I submit that Congress could not have done more to avoid entanglement with religion by the federal government of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="5119.229" offset="20581313">In conclusion, I would just like to state that counsel for the appellants here this afternoon has made an issue, and quite a significant issue, of the fact that he has labeled the four colleges in this case sectarian, whereas, the appellees refer to them as church-related, and he indicated that he was consistent throughout the case in labeling them and calling them sectarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.197" offset="20681206">I would refer the Court to page 99 of the appendix in which the stipulation entered into between counsel for the appellants and the State of Connecticut is set forth, and further direct the Court's attention to paragraph 16 in which we considered and used and agreed upon the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.309" offset="20761663">“The Commission and members thereof have had occasion to consider questions raised concerning the constitutionality of grants to church-related institutions on at least several occasions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.639" offset="20806907">So, I submit that counsel for the appellants, on occasion, has used the term church-related in referring to these institutions.</text>
