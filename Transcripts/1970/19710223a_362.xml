            <label>Mr. Alan H. Levine</label>
            <text syncTime="37.327" offset="252635">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.630" offset="265906">This case is before you on writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.591" offset="289729">The petitioner seeks to review of convictions on four counts under the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.931" offset="339048">The chief question presented by this petition is the question left open in McKart versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.323" offset="368619">It presents the pure question of whether where a registrant presents a claim for conscious objection and that claim is denied without a basis in fact as the Second Circuit concedes here it was so denied, and where therefore, the classification -- I-A classification and the induction order were illegal, is he barred from challenging that classification and induction order in judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.037" offset="515532">In answering that question, no, we will assert two basic propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.118" offset="539878">One that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine is inappropriately applied, whereas McKart suggested, its effect is not merely to delay judicial review, but is to deny it completely and we will defend, secondly, the proposition that if the exhaustion of administrative remedies is to be applied so harshly.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.589" offset="645726">It must be applied with congressional mandate in that the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 to the contrary, does not limit judicial review in defense to a criminal prosecution, but in fact guarantees judicial review in defense to a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.788" offset="730572">Petitioner, at the time of induction was a full time student at Union Theological Seminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.407" offset="757008">He had registered for the draft in August of 1961 in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.304" offset="776547">He had advised his local board at that time that he was preparing for the ministry.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.440" offset="797132">In August of 1964, he enrolled in the University of Rochester the next month was a given a II-S deferment for all practical purposes kept that deferment until September of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.929" offset="855124">In February 1966 while still at the University of Rochester and still possessing at II-S classification, he applied for conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.194" offset="900159">Pursuant to regulations, the local board deferred consideration of that application until he was no longer entitled to a lower classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.756" offset="942373">In March of 1966, he got a letter from the local board to that effect that they would defer consideration of CO application.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.324" offset="980720">In April of 1967, still at Rochester, still possessing a II-S, the petitioner wrote the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.323" offset="1016665">He enclosed in that letter remnants of a torn and burnt draft card.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.954" offset="1079150">Subsequent to the trial in this case, he was indicted on two counts of destroying a draft card.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.652" offset="1137977">He wrote to President in April 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.358" offset="1148844">He advised the President that he would probably be entitled to a theological deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.054" offset="1171623">Nevertheless, he said, “I must sever every link with violence and war.”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.547" offset="1197537">He expressed, “the fundamental belief that man must build and not destroy, love and not hate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.001" offset="1227421">As a result, he said that he could no longer cooperate with the Selective Service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.666" offset="1249991">In June of 1967, upon his graduation from Rochester, he was sent a current information questionnaire, SSS Form 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.878" offset="1290846">He returned that questionnaire unopened and said that he would return all future correspondence unopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.487" offset="1321357">In September of 1967, he was classified I-A despite his pending CO application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.698" offset="4678196">The effect of the application of the exhaustion rule in this case and in criminal cases generally is to work a very substantial denial of a right in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.832" offset="4734725">The difference between the application of that rule in an affirmative and defense of case was elaborated on by Chief Judge McGruder in two cases cited in our brief, the Smith and McCrellis case and there, the judge said that, we do not have to apply the exhaustion rule in the defensive context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.103" offset="4811734">It is a judge made rule and we only have to when it is mandated by Congress and the Court there dealt with the two major precedents in this Court upon which exhaustion has been premised, namely Yerkes and Myers versus Bethlehem Shipbuilding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.596" offset="4873801">And the Court there said, “Those were specifically cases in which Congress had mandated the exhaustion prior to judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.496" offset="4913403">Here as we said before, there was congressional mandate to that effect and in fact, the congressional mandate is to the contrary that it authorizes judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.057" offset="4967633">That brings us to McKart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.483" offset="4977351">McKart, we submit, reflects that general suspicion of the exhaustion remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.745" offset="5002324">It draws the distinctions between affirmative and defensive context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.349" offset="5020818">It points out that in a defensive context, it is an exceedingly harsh doctrine and it should be imposed there only where it clearly out ways the interests of the registrant in having a right to assert a defense to a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.778" offset="5090513">The major interest to be served here is whether or not other registrants are going to be led by the relaxation of the exhaustion rule in this case to forgo their administrative remedies and come into court in defense of a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.332" offset="5168671">The McKart, court suggested that maybe there's a difference between the legal issue presented there in the CO claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.403" offset="5200959">The CO claim we submit is a legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.351" offset="5212766">You take as the court does in any basis in fact case before it, an undisputed set of facts and apply them to a legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.222" offset="5252263">It is the same issue which confronts this Court whether or not there is exhaustion, there is no different burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.130" offset="5279848">The question then is are other registrants going to do what McGee did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.532" offset="5301478">Recognizing as we must that what McGee did, he did for out of reasons of moral scruples, but will other registrants do it for tactical reasons and the Government's response to this is crucial and I think deserves special attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.872" offset="5362813">The Government says, “If we let McGee decline to appear before his local board as he did here, decline to appeal his administrative remedies, then the well counseled registrant is going to submit a bare Form 150, will provide on its face no basis in fact for denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.071" offset="5451630">It will not have a great deal of documentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.140" offset="7567966">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.072" offset="7583640">I think that the cases of Falbo and Estep, read together fairly established that the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies does have a place in criminal actions brought under the Selective Service laws and that general concept was not under attack in the recent McKart and Duvernay cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.901" offset="7670993">They involve instead, exceptional circumstances, set to warrant a relaxation of the doctrine on particular facts presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.967" offset="7715192">Petitioner seeks to have this Court overrule Falbo, Estep and their progeny, primarily because as I understand the argument, he come before the courts not as a plaintiff seeking affirmative relief, but as a defendant charged with a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.611" offset="7789798">At the outset, it seems that if an application of the exhaustion doctrine were to turn on such a distinction, the effect would be in essence to penalize the registrant who after failing to exercise his administrative remedies decides to obey the law and submit to induction, seeking affirmative relief in the courts through a habeas corpus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.591" offset="7889690">He would, under petitioner's theory, be precluded by the exhaustion doctrine from challenging his classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.421" offset="7917066">On the other hand, if the same registrant had decided to violate the law and he then been criminally prosecuted, petitioner maintains that he cannot similarly be barred from raising the same claim as a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.789" offset="8110477">Moreover, to insist that the exhaustion doctrine cannot be invoked under any circumstances in criminal prosecutions under the Selective Service laws, is to ignore the statutory scheme on which this Court has based its earlier decisions in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.326" offset="8176724">Congress and the President have carefully constructed a very comprehensive and fair administrative appeal process within the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.486" offset="8213295">At the time a local board classifies a registrant, it is required to notify him that he has 30 days within which to request a personal appearance before his local board or to take an appeal to the state appeal board and that there is a Government appeal agent available to advice him fully of his appeal rights and assist him in the appeal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.014" offset="8303470">At a personal appearance, the registrant may discuss his classification with the local board members and present both orally and in writing any new information, he believes maybe relevant to his claim and a written record of the appearance is placed in his Selective Service file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.819" offset="8378598">On appeal to the state appeal board, the registrant may specify in writing the matters in which he believes the local board erred or which he believes it failed to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.110" offset="8427813">The state appeal board's consideration is de novo based on its independent review of the registrant Selective Service file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.168" offset="8459995">It's classification is one of first instance, not a mere affirmance or reversal of the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.149" offset="8487999">Moreover, if the information in the registrant selective service file is not sufficient to unable the appeal board to determine the proper classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.860" offset="8526764">The appeal board is required by the regulations to return the file to the local board for additional information or action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.186" offset="8560097">From the final decision by the state appeal board an appeal maybe taken to the national board if one, the state appeal board had been divided or two, even had not it been divided, if the national or state director is asked by the registrant to take the case to the national board on his behalf and a question of some importance appears to be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.565" offset="8645674">No registrant can be ordered to report for induction while his classification is being considered by the local and appeal boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.791" offset="8682559">Now, while a registrant is nowhere required in the statute or regulations to seek an administrative review of his local board classification, the exhaustion of administrative remedy's principle seems implicit in the entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.827" offset="8742640">When Congress in 1967 added to Section 10 (b) (3), the provision generally prohibiting judicial review of classification and processing questions until after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.701" offset="8814216">The legislative history reflects clearly that the intent was to commit the resolution of such questions in the first instance to the discretion and expertise of the local and appeal boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.331" offset="8860714">And this intent, it seems to us was underscored in this Court's recent decisions in Oestereich and Clark v, Gabriel, defining the narrow scope of pre-induction judicial review under Section 10 (b) (3) that is available to registrants who have exhausted their administrative appeal remedies and it seem to be central to the unanimous decision of the Court on a last term in Malloy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.911" offset="8971055">Of course, as stated in the McKart case, the exhaustion doctrine must be tailored to fit the peculiarities of the administrative system which Congress and the President have created and thus where, as in McKart, the classification is not one requiring administrative discretion and expertise, but turns instead on statutory interpretation, there is generally good reason to exhaust the exhaustion principle, to require further resort to local and appeal boards which are concededly ill-suited to the task of coping with such pure questions of law which serve no real purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.095" offset="9123715">Similarly, if the local board's action is challenged on strict constitutional grounds as was the situation in the Wolff case in the Second Circuit, exhaustion of administrative remedies might not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.033" offset="9175542">In that case the Second Circuit declined to invoke the doctrine, to preclude judicial review of delinquency re-classifications assigned to registrants for sitting in at their draft boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.377" offset="9220890">And the reason given was that the action by the local board raises significant First Amendment questions under this Court's decision in Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.279" offset="9260492">Nor would it seem is the doctrine, so wouldn't as to require its application where a registrant he can show he was physically unable to exhaust or he can show some other special or unusual circumstances which justified his failure to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.388" offset="9328933">And I think in this connection it's instructed to point out that the case McNeel v. United States, a conscientious objector case which was remanded to the District Court after McKart for a further consideration in light of this Court's decision in McKart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.441" offset="9393089">In that case, Judge Merrick of the eastern district of Virginia, he relaxed the exhaustion principle on the ground that there were in that case special circumstances in his words, that is that the registrant was apparently -- that the registrant apparently lacked any comprehension of his administrative rights under the administrative appeal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.464" offset="9489220">However, we do not consider the instant case to be within any of these exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.088" offset="9515760">At the outset, petitioner's efforts to bring the case within the McKart rational on the ground that the local board failed to consider his conscientious objector claim is simply not supported by this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.873" offset="9570826">While there's some ambiguity in the board chairman's testimony as to whether the claim was in March 1966 at the time petitioner held the student-deferment whether it was considered at that time, the record clearly establishes that petitioner's entire file was reviewed and considered by the full board prior to reclassification in September 1967, that's when he got his I-A classification from the II-S classification and the District Court found as a fact that the claim had been fully considered as did the majority below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.071" offset="9707708">But I think the essential point here is that even had the local board failed to consider the claim, in the circumstances of this case, McKart would not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.734" offset="9754311">It is undisputed that the local board's action in September 1967 was not in response to the letter petitioner wrote to the President on April 15, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.433" offset="9801122">That is, we do not have here in instance of unlawful reclassification by the local board in the Oestereich and Breen sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.641" offset="9837902">At most, we have a situation where the board, in March of 1966, did not actually consider the claim because petitioner at that time had a lower II-S classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.670" offset="9890043">And then in September 1967, the board mistakenly believing that it earlier considered the claim and finding no new information in the file relating to the claim, based its denial on what it thought to be a prior determination on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.375" offset="9956916">It is our view that is precisely the type of procedural error, had then in fact been the case, which Congress and the President anticipated at the time they constructed the elaborate appeal machinery within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.993" offset="10011355">Plainly, a personal appearance would have corrected such a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.210" offset="10028178">An appeal to the state appeal board which is required to consider petitioner's file de novo would certainly have cured the mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.956" offset="10063182">Nothing here, suggests that such as a course would have been a futile exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.977" offset="10087320">Unlike McKart, the administrative determination to petitioner's conscientious objector claim was not a matter solely a statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.729" offset="10126294">There was no statement here by the state director as there was in the McKart that he was predisposed to deny petitioner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.621" offset="10157850">Moreover, we are not here dealing with a classification question where this Court can determine with any certainty as it could in the McKart that petitioner is entitled to an exemption as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.664" offset="10206020">Here, the claim is to conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.120" offset="10223888">Such a claim by its very nature calls for the type of factual determinations which Congress has said, should in the first instance, be left to the discretion and special expertise of local and appeal boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.116" offset="10279790">Moreover, it is one of the few claims that does not turn exclusively on the registrant's written submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.444" offset="10313122">It is undisputed that petitioner made out a prima facie case for exemption in his special conscientious objector form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.882" offset="10346872">But as this Court recognized in the Witmer case and again in Seeger, there is also the substantial question of petitioner's sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.362" offset="10384802">Here, the local board which did consider the claim may have thought the petitioner was insincere perhaps because he claimed to have always then a religious conscientious objector and yet in August 1964, at the time when he held the I-A classification, he expressed some willingness to submit to induction or perhaps because his letter to the President was read by the local board as reflecting an objection to the Government's policies in Vietnam and the board might have thought that this was the real basis for his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.188" offset="10512175">Whatever the basis for the local board's denial in this case, we think it is clear that the administrative system never had an opportunity to examine the sincerity of petitioner's professed beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.353" offset="10568808">Perhaps as petitioner suggests, if the local board doubted his sincerity, the better approach would have been to call him in for an interview prior to reclassification, but the law does not require local boards to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.782" offset="10626487">Moreover, in view of petitioner's letter to the President and his subsequent statement to the local board that he would return all correspondence from the system unopened, both of which took place prior to the time that the local board considered his claim in September 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.633" offset="10701928">It seems to us unlikely, that the petitioner would've appeared even if the local board had made such a request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.234" offset="10872351">The essential point Your Honor is that the Selective Service laws place the burden on the registrant to prove his sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.551" offset="10913625">Had petitioner requested a personal interview, perhaps, he could have lay to rest any doubts that the local board might if have in this regard. Had he taken an appeal to the state appeal board, perhaps it would've read petitioner's file differently than the local board and granted the exemption or it might have found the information in the file insufficient and send it back to the local board with instructions to call petitioner for an interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.974" offset="11023235">What we are saying is, if the local board did in fact commit error in the classification of the petitioner, it was precisely the type of error within the competence of the administrative agency to correct, but petitioner has chosen deliberately to bypass the administrative appeal machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.974" offset="11099303">Whatever his reasons, he is willfully adopted a position of total non-cooperation with the system, a choice he made prior to the time that the board gave final consideration to his claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.178" offset="11152071">Thus, there has been no opportunity for the local and appeal board to consider fully the sincerity of his professed beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.472" offset="11189269">If the exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required in this case, it seems to us that the operation of a selective service system could be seriously and effectively disrupted by others who might choose deliberately to bypass this elaborate administrative machinery that Congress and the President have established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.767" offset="11270457">They would then be able to submit to their local board's well-drafted conscientious objector claims, followed shortly by a letter, advising the board that their opposition is so strong that they no longer can cooperate with the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.012" offset="11339421">Their cases then come to the courts in the same posture as the instant case without anyone having an opportunity to pass directly on the sincerity of their professed beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.246" offset="11388322">Since the courts are not permitted under this Court's ruling in Gibson to receive additional evidence on this question, it seems to us they would have no choice, following the Estep standard which is now in statute but to dismiss a criminal prosecution for refusal to submit on the ground that the registrant selective service file, that is the documents which were before the board shows no basis in fact for denial of the prime facie written claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.007" offset="11515382">We are not suggesting that the sincere registrants who are genuinely opposed to participation in war in any form are likely to run to this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.788" offset="11558536">As pointed out in McKart, it seems unlikely that they will risk criminal conviction before taking all possible steps within the system to obtain an exemption or deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.467" offset="11601272">But in our view the exhaustion requirement is not need for such registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.878" offset="11622902">It is needed instead to cope with the recusant registrant who refuses for reasons best known to him to cooperate with the system in any way, who quite often is more intent on disrupting the operation of the system than obtaining an exemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.119" offset="11691865">It seems to us that he should not be allowed to sit back and ignore the administrative processes with impunity while others are being called up to serve in his place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.718" offset="13006242">The failure to report to his pre-induction physical examination, petitioner justified that on the fact that because he was classified I-A improperly, he was under no obligation to obey the intermediate directives of a local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.520" offset="13105403">I don't believe that this argument can be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.979" offset="13123271">The pre-induction physical examination is for the purpose of assuring the local board that a registrant is physically qualified and available for induction prior to the time that it issues its induction order in order to fill its call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.729" offset="13210311">The induction which petitioner under went at the station is a much more -- a much shorter examination and it is merely to determine the changes in his physical status from the time of his earlier pre-induction physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.708" offset="13302157">And therefore, it's our view that does not absolve his failure to report to the selective service pre-induction physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.455" offset="13341236">He argues that his notice of classification was invalid because his assigned classification was invalid, in our view, to qualify or valid and the regulation relates to anything to -- does not relate to anything other than the certificate itself, that it be authentic and properly executed and petitioner does not contest the fact that his notice of classification fully met these requirements and finally on the information questionnaire, the categorical language of the regulation violated, provides that each registrant shall submit to his local board in writing all information which the local board may at any time request from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.341" offset="13508733">Petitioner concedes that his failure to respond to the current information questionnaire undoubtedly violated this language and we believe there is no good excuse, no good reason to excuse the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.322" offset="13560665">We are not dealing here with a minor lapse, but with a flat defiance of a reasonable request for information not readily available to the local board otherwise in which petitioner never provided to it.</text>
