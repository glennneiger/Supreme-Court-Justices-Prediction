            <label>Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.274" offset="148459">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.834" offset="166745">This case comes from the Supreme Court of Colorado and presents two questions important to the proper administration and conservation of the water resources of Colorado and nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.844" offset="234768">First, whether Congress by enacting so called McCarran Amendment codified at 43, United States Codes 666 intended to consent to a suit against the United States for adjudication of its water rights in one of 70 water districts of the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.473" offset="337272">And secondly, whether in the absence of any expressly stated intent to subject ?reserved rights of the United States? to state court adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.848" offset="390771">such intent can be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.935" offset="407071">I plan to discuss preliminary and briefly the nature of water adjudications of the west and specifically that proceeding here involved in Colorado then address the threshold question of the application or the rule in this Court's opinion in Dugan v. Rank in 372 U.S. holding that the consent applied only to general adjudications then discussed the legislative history of the consent statute and lastly, the nature and extent of reserve water rights and the ability of the state courts of Colorado to adjudicate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.097" offset="563806">Historically, water rights were judicially determined in the western states by flat Title action initiated by one or more water users.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.165" offset="608005">The other claimants to water rights on the stream system were joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.166" offset="628067">Each party affirmatively presented its claim and contested the claims of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.128" offset="655862">This proceeding resulted in a determination by quantity and priority of the rights of the parties inter se say that has developed in most to the western states, statutory modification of this procedure or by the state engineer or some other official initiates the proceeding and presents the evidence in the first instance, but it instance remains the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.994" offset="763382">A determination by the Court of the rights of all the parties on the Supreme System inter se say.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.955" offset="795146">This proceeding was initiated in 1967 in the Water District 37 which at that time was one of 70 water districts of the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.136" offset="847914">These districts were established on water shed lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.089" offset="863692">Water District 37, being the water shed of the Eagle River, the Eagle River being a tributary of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.764" offset="902457">This was a supplemental proceeding, there being a number of adjudications in Water District 37 over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.688" offset="942164">First one, over eight years ago and the last one as recently as in 1966, the year before the instant proceeding was initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.522" offset="985422">Now, a significant attribute of a supplemental proceeding under Colorado law is that the earliest priority decreed in such an adjudication must be later than the last priory date decreed in the preceding adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.560" offset="1049579">Or stated otherwise, all rights awarded in a new supplemental proceeding such as one before the Court are necessarily junior by operation of Colorado law to those decreed in previous adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.277" offset="1116453">This supplemental proceeding was initiated by the Colorado River Water Conservation District which adds before adjudication a decree of certain of its claimed water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.244" offset="1164309">Other claimants appeared and the Conservation District sought to join the United States as a partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.152" offset="1195969">The United States moved to have itself dismissed, asserting among other things that this was not the type of proceeding that the Congress has consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.986" offset="1235362">The motion was denied by the District Court of Colorado for Eagle County and the United States sought a writ from the Supreme Court of Colorado to prohibit the District Court from asserting jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.533" offset="1293458">The Supreme Court of Colorado determined that the motion to dismiss was properly denied and rendered an extensive opinion in which have held first that Congress had intended to include the water adjudication procedure of Colorado among the suits to which it had consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.830" offset="1366706">Secondly, the Colorado Supreme Court held that notwithstanding this Court's interpretation of the consent statute in Dugan v. Rank that the statute permits joinder of the United States in a supplemental proceeding involving only a tributary water shed.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.164" offset="1444028">With respect to Reserved Water Rights of the United States, the Colorado Supreme Court strongly suggested that the United States had no water rights in Colorado except those arising under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.796" offset="1510588">The Court said that the decisions of this Court, including Arizona v. California in 373, U.S. were not determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.642" offset="1549981">Indeed, the Colorado Supreme Court said that the only decision that might be determinative of this question was one of its own and that if the Colorado Supreme Court determined that the United States has reserved rights in Colorado streams then that decision would or that determination would require the overruling of its previous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.855" offset="1638797">And in that previous decision upon which the Colorado Supreme Court relies and it refers to in the course of its opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court had said that by admitting Colorado into the Union with a provision in its Constitution declaring on appropriated waters within the state to be the property of and subject to appropriation by the people of the state, that the United States lost any right to assert water rights in Colorado except those required by appropriation subject to a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.645" offset="1761991">And in its ultimate holding here for review, the Colorado Supreme Court held that whatever water rights the United States has, such rights, including reserved rights, can be recognized and adequately adjudicated by the Colorado District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.731" offset="8142346">I would like to touch kind of briefly in at least partial response to some of the questions asked by Mr. Justice White on just exactly what an adjudication is under the Colorado law and if I correctly understand the laws of the other involved states primarily the 17 western arid and semi-arid states, Colorado has a really somewhat difference system of the balance or had at least under the 1943 Act and that was purely judicial, without any involvement of a state officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.194" offset="8276198">But nonetheless it was a state sponsored or what the Pacific Live Stock case decided by this Court said was a quasi judicial proceeding sponsored with the public, quasi public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.487" offset="8345370">At the time that the McCarran Amendment was passed, I would say, though I don't know this precisely, that of the 70 water districts referred to by counsel, probably all but two or three had already had not won the original proceeding but possibly a half a dozen others or more denominated supplementary adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.083" offset="8415692">And I just do not believe it can be possible that the Congress intended in passing this law, knowing full well at all of the states as it recognized, that long head this type of system intended to waste its times by passing an amendment which would not allow the enjoinment of the United States because the proceeding is very denominated as in this case supplemental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.503" offset="8497403">Now, the subject matter of an adjudication proceeding is not people, it is the river itself that raises the water and it is a kind of an action in rem and it is a continuing action because its purpose is to establish, in the order priority, the rights of those persons and entities claiming the right to use water out of the particular stream involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.718" offset="8582248">So though you use supplementary when you start an action similar to the one that was started in Eagle County as involved here, nonetheless, it means it was in addition to a continuation of the original proceedings commenced in that county great many years before and serves as the method and the means of not only quantifying the water right, but putting it on the water rights ladder in its proper order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.348" offset="8688724">And that is all, if I correctly read the Pacific Live Stock case that any western water adjudication proceeding does, it's established under the appropriation doctrine.</text>
