            <label>Mr. Albert J. Datz</label>
            <text syncTime="179.578" offset="821687">The petitioner, James Rewis and Mary Williams were convicted in the Middle District of Florida of the crime involved in the violation of 18 United States Code 1952, known as the Travel Act, that is of traveling and causing travel in Interstate Commerce with and intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on and to facilitate the promotion and management, establishment and carrying on of a gambling activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.987" offset="931297">Now, the gambling activity involved was a lottery known as Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.270" offset="948433">And in this particular case, Cuba is called Cuba because at that time, the winning number was picked through the national lottery in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.630" offset="985840">It was picked around 2 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon each week and the people in the State of Florida who were actually violating the laws of the State of Florida and running this “Cuba activity” would wait and get the winning number from Cuba and that of course would determine the winning number of anybody who had played.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.355" offset="1076746">Now, this lottery, so far as this case is concerned was operated from the home of Mary Williams at a small community between Jacksonville, Florida and Fernandina Beach, Florida known as Yulee.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.410" offset="1132962">This home was about a half a mile from the main highway U.S. 17 which led to Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.083" offset="1159711">Georgia was about 15 miles north of Yulee.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.035" offset="1175489">The game was a relatively small game as pointed out in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.694" offset="1190118">I believe that the take on the particular Saturday which -- in which it was rated was about a $125.00 although concededly that Rewis who we’ll see as the pick up man or operator of the game, had over $1500.00 in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.791" offset="1262529">But significantly, the winning number fell on the Saturday afternoon and most of the players would pick their numbers on Friday night and Saturday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.398" offset="1300982">Undoubtedly, Mary Williams who was operating a selling establishment there from her home was the seller of the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.541" offset="1329507">Rewis was the central figure who picked up the business each Saturday, around noon, before the winning number would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.721" offset="1362213">Now, the issue at the trial as here was whether or not travel by some customers who were from Georgia at least 15 miles to the north invested the operation with this travel in Interstate Commerce required by the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.956" offset="1435146">However, the theory of the Government at the trial and the theory in the appellate courts is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.905" offset="1462941">At the trial, the Government contended and the District Judge agreed that the travel of the customers themselves invested this illegal activity with the interstate character necessary for conviction and that the customers or betters themselves could be convicted under the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.679" offset="1538069">Now, after the conviction, the Fifth Circuit disagreed with that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.703" offset="1578193">Originally, there were 11 people indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.639" offset="1589896">One was Rewis’ wife who was excused because of illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.808" offset="1610585">Four had directed the motions for judgment of acquittal granted by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.309" offset="1636603">Two were acquitted by the jury and finally, two who were convicted, their convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the theory that the only evidence against them was that they were these gamblers, that they were the betters, the customers and that the Travel Act itself did not proscribe the conduct of the better, only the operator of the business enterprise as defined by the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.338" offset="1760737">Subsection B of the statute, Section 1952 describes the unlawful activity as a business enterprise and they -- short look at the legislative history of that statute shows without any doubt that the intent of Congress was to proscribe the activities of the business enterprise and we submit that the reverse is true that it did not intend to proscribe the activities of the better.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.199" offset="1880168">Now, the Government has not contended otherwise here, but the Fifth Circuit in reversing as to the two customers, affirmed of conviction as to the Rewis and Williams, the last two remaining defendants, on the theory that by placing this game, this lottery within 15 miles of the Georgia border, that they had attracted, sort of an attracted nuisance theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.929" offset="1975045">They had attracted these betters from the State of Georgia to Florida and thus the interstate character was bestowed upon this gambling operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.470" offset="2013288">What would you say if the gambling establishment had been 15 feet inside the line from Georgia?</text>

            <text syncTime="494.853" offset="2082774">Now, we might get into another area on the question of use of interstate facilities to promote, manage etcetera a gambling operation because as an example, suppose, they put up a big billboard right at the border and say, “Come over to Florida and participate in our gambling operation” then there would be some question of interstate facility but not travel --</text>

            <text syncTime="540.248" offset="2264377">They are promoting, establishing, maintaining and carrying on this operation, the exact word the statute condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.999" offset="2291336">But the mere placing of the sign at the boarder would not be sufficient or placing the game 15 feet from the boarder would not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.114" offset="2327803">But here we have 15 miles and the Court of Appeals said that this attracted these players across the state line and invested the case with the interstate character necessary for conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.850" offset="12530813">In other words, even though you did everything, but one particular element but you got somebody else, to me the best case of the -- the best illustration of this case is the Kelly case which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.071" offset="12583685">And the Kelly case involved the use of telephones and the defendant there made an arrangement whereby the betters would use the telephones and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that this -- that , that violated the statute when that he causes -- caused the use of the interstate facility when the betters used the telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.767" offset="12738435">Basically, to sum up, we think that just as if Rewis and Williams had advertised in Georgia or people who would come from Georgia to Florida and people who read their advertisement came to Flor -- from Georgia to Florida with a specific purpose to betting and they did so on the basis of reading this advertisement, “Come to Florida and bet,” that in such circumstances, we think Rewis and Williams would bring about or cause the travel of the better.</text>
