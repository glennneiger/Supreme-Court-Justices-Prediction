            <label>Mr. H. Alva Brumfield</label>
            <text syncTime="40.801" offset="266533">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.095" offset="291715">The sole question presented in this case is whether operational negligence occurring at the time of the injury renders a vessel instantaneously unseaworthy is devoid of any problems of defective equipment on seaworthiness and any part of the vessel whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.357" offset="408848">A motion for a summary judgment filed by the ship owner was denied by the Trial Court on the basis of Mascuilli.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.861" offset="462764">If this Circuit Court of Appeal reversed a holding that the operational negligence as presented in the case did not instantaneously make the ship unseaworthy and in effect refused to follow this, the Courts decision in Mascuilli.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.629" offset="557850">Now, Mascuilli, the facts there are on all force with the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.269" offset="584495">The facts in Usner was that the ship was seaworthy, the equipment was, -- it was the operational negligence of an operator, a longshoreman of a winch that calls the sling to come down too fast into the barge and striking the petitioner and injuring him.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.351" offset="684805">The equipment was used before and after this occurrence without any trouble whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.240" offset="716361">And the same thing is true with the facts as established from the record in Mascuilli, because the Trial Court in that case found in the findings of fact number 35 that the operational negligence of the winch operators in operating the guide, the winches that had detached the guidelines in such a manner that they became taut and causing a breakage of the equipment striking the Mascuilli and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.862" offset="866826">So, it was done so instantaneously that the officer had no opportunity to give a warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.482" offset="897337">So, the case is on all force and we submit that Mascuilli is the posture of the issue here and answers the question very clearly to us that operational negligence occurring at the time of the injury makes the ship instantaneously unseaworthy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="219.821" stopTime="225.735">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="219.821" offset="982706">Even if it's not on board, the ship or having anything directly to do with the ship.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Alva Brumfield</label>
            <text syncTime="225.735" offset="1006320">Even if it has nothing to do with the ship, the ship owner has no knowledge of it, didnt own it, had no control of it as was held in Patterson, may it please Your Honor in the Landmark case, the Court held that that was no defense and that it made the ship unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.620" offset="1089808">Now, the Fifth Circuit has and the Ninth, I believe have been straining nuts and hairsplitting and attempting to apply a time element to make the negligent act exist to such an extent that the -- it would ripen into an unseaworthiness condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.997" offset="1191372">And the decisions just are not reconcilable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.786" offset="1214568">And we submit that the reason that theyve got themselves on these horns of dilemma is because they failed to follow fundamental principles and guidelines that this Court has annunciated over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.964" offset="1275277">Unseaworthiness can be caused by no negligence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.542" offset="1297533">The structural defects, unseaworthiness can be caused by a non negligent act as Mr. Justice Black in Walden where the jury found that the order given by the mate to move the rope by two instead of three or four seaman was not negligent yet this case held that the question of unseaworthiness should be submitted to the jury even though the jury had found that that act itself was not negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.520" offset="1429504">Unseaworthiness can be caused by negligent acts and unseaworthiness can be called by negligent acts which occur at the same time and make the ship instantaneously unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.531" offset="1497527">Now, this Court has never, never required that there be a showing that time must elapse from the negligent act until the occurrence of the unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.451" offset="1565132">This Court has never done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.385" offset="1572864">In Mahnich, this Court held that the act of the seaman in choosing the rotten rope instead of the good rope created unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.647" offset="1629915">In Crumady, Mr. Justice Douglas held that the act of setting the electrical cutoff device incorrectly created unseaworthiness.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="394.910" offset="1682996">Were those cases on ship board or on the docks or the piers?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_alva_brumfield" startTime="398.962" stopTime="552.358">
            <label>Mr. H. Alva Brumfield</label>
            <text syncTime="398.962" offset="1699192">On -- Mahnich was a seaman, Crumady was a longshoreman both on ship but in Gutierrez, Mr. Justice White, it occurred on the dock where the beans spilled out of defective containers holding that that caused unseaworthiness to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.986" offset="1803368">So this Court has never, never required this so called lapse of time to ripen an act of negligence into unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.979" offset="1851329">Because somewhere down the line, usually you are going to find some act of negligence that started in motion to make the ship unseaworthy and this Court has held that theres no distinction between the acts of the equipment itself being defective for example and the acts of personnel or the seaman or the longshoreman or the workers aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.526" offset="1961462">That was clearly pointed out in board one and in Walden itself and at the moment that a piece of equipment or pertinence of the ship itself, became defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.276" offset="2012453">It was at that very moment that the ship became unseaworthy and the same is true by the act of a defective seaman or a defective worker performing a negligent act.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.295" offset="2064593">The minute he does that that makes the -- and it causes injury, that makes the ship unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.871" offset="2094895">And we submit, may it please Your Honor that in Mascuilli, when the question was posed as to whether or not because in Mahnich and in Crumady and Gutierrez, the question as to the time lapse wasnt even considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.864" offset="2166784">But in Mascuilli, you had it before you exactly that question as to whether or not the operation by the winch negligently making the guidelines come top and breaking, cause an injury instantaneously without the affording of the officer or any one giving -- having opportunity giving a warning, you held in no uncertain occurrence, may it please Your Honor that that was unseaworthiness and that liability of the ship owner was established.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.064" offset="2475656">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.046" offset="2487568">I'm just suggesting, I suppose there comes on recourse of legal development or one might take a new look.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Alva Brumfield</label>
            <text syncTime="605.719" offset="2526229">But may it please Your Honor, insofar as the Stevedores are longshoremans, it is -- it is known and can be taken as a fact that the Sieracki seaman or the people or the workers in that place are doing now work that was traditionally done before by the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.108" offset="2619852">And that work has become more dangerous -- using more dangerous and hazardous equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.062" offset="2647646">And so it gives rise to this Court extending the Maritime Law to these type of workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.588" offset="2697697">And insofar as the triad of going back in indemnity against Stevedore, laid down various lines there that where the unsafe place to work, where this duty was violated in that respect, then of course there would be indemnity over from the Stevedore to the ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.648" offset="2817964">And so that in itself is not a -- shouldnt be a determinant.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.384" offset="2836877">It has not been because of the principles of -- that have been annunciated by this Court that this duty of warranty of furnishing a ship reasonably safe for the intended purpose and furnishing a place safe to work has been founded in the law annunciated by this Court down through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.812" offset="2950666">And we can see nothing insofar as that problem goes that would cause a tying up of not only pages of jurisprudence of this Court but sir I would say volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.283" offset="3016495">And in this condition of unseaworthiness can be transitory but it's a temporary condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.782" offset="3042513">Back in this case, well, the Mitchell case with Mr. Justice Stewart where the 1221 on the rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.157" offset="3075950">Here, you had -- instead of that, you had longshoreman creating this transitory, temporary condition by his negligent act.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.658" offset="3117955">And I know that we speak of unseaworthiness, it connotes a condition and we speak of negligent, it connotes causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.846" offset="3166751">But just because that the twain is met and just because you have causation and negligence occurring at the same time, nonetheless you have unseaworthiness and thats exactly what this Court has adhered to all the way and it is not the -- it's not so much as the manner in which the condition of unseaworthiness took place but the fact that it did, it's a species of liability without fault is really what it amounts to.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.379" offset="3432887">And you so held in Walden because the jury in that case held with the very act of the mate giving the order was not negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.486" offset="3473324">And yet this Court reversed to send it back to submit the unseaworthiness pressful to the jury on the basis that it didnt take any negligence at all to make an unseaworthiness condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.296" offset="3524524">But just because you got operational negligence occurring at the time of the injury, that still doesnt make it not unseaworthiness, thats how simple it is to me that for the life, I cannot understand why the Courts -- and I know that some of the Court say that if particularly, you criticize Mascuilli by saying it's not illuminating and it's cryptic and by saying that you didnt procure and you used the -- I believe you used exactly 14 words in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.432" offset="3673109">And you said the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.269" offset="3696410">But it couldnt be anything any clearer than that to me because what was presented to you as a matter of law is where the instantaneous negligence made the ship instantaneously unseaworthy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.853" offset="5746813">You never have done that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.410" offset="6085047">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.056" offset="6103646">Addressing ourselves first to the question just asked by Mr. Justice Blackmun, it's our submission that the Court could not in Mascuilli have meant the reversal to be on operational negligence basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.804" offset="6166549">The concept was new to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.714" offset="6174177">The concept was a very large one affecting an entire industry and it is generally thought by the bench and bar we believe that the Court would not have summarily treated such an important subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.509" offset="6237393">On the other hand, Mascuilli did in fact have as its basis the, tight line situation that did come up in Crumady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.574" offset="6285667">It did have as a potential, the same type of thing, accident that happened in Crumady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.835" offset="6314715">There were no electric cutout switches in Mascuilli and it wouldve been very easy for the court in Mascuilli to have pitched -- I'm talking about the District Court now -- to have pitched its decision in favor of the plaintiff on an unseaworthiness basis not an operational negligence basis but on the basis that the ship was improperly rigged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.423" offset="6405099">And the condition that we say must be incident of any case where liability is imposed on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.633" offset="6437909">That condition did then exist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.335" offset="6460688">Certainly, the citation of Mahnich and Crumady does not give rise to any thought that this Court is reversing on a theory of instantaneous unseaworthiness or operational negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.333" offset="6532681">This is a case, if the Court please and all unseaworthiness cases are cases of liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.908" offset="6562983">That is of course true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.278" offset="6572492">This man who was injured was standing on a barge next door to the ship which was being loaded, the cargo was being handled from the barge to the ship, the sling was brought down too quickly, struck him, knocked him off the barge and caused his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.107" offset="6651800">He was immediately adjacent to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.278" offset="6668518">There was no unseaworthiness present that we can dissent or that anyone has suggested in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.869" offset="6706866">The fact is that this was operational negligence the winch man let the swing down too fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.424" offset="6745109">Since it's liability without fault, is it a matter of having an insurance liability for anyone who goes on and board a ship, who has a business on board a ship, who is a passenger, who is a workman?</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.594" offset="6813759">If so, then we submit, it's up to Congress to make that decision or certainly, it's up to this Court to do it and this Court has not yet done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.073" offset="6855659">There is no such thing as an insurer's liability as yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.286" offset="6872482">If Your Honors choose to make such a decision, it will be a future decision but none exist on the books as of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.640" offset="6913964">If however, it is any act which causes an injury to another party on board ship regardless of weather, the act is negligent, and regardless of whether the ship becomes unseaworthy, then if the Court please, it is exactly that act that is in fact imposing the ship owner -- the insurer's liability on the ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.863" offset="7022843">And this is what we submit cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.061" offset="7035591">I think that Mr. Justice Stewart suggested that of course in Mr. Brumfields argument and I think thats the answer to the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.569" offset="7077700">It cannot be that you can put liability on an act unless it's negligence or on a condition unless it's unseaworthy -- unseaworthiness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.076" offset="13443636">And by the same token, if that grease was dropped on the seaman or worker himself and say hit him in the eye and put his eye off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.690" offset="13490134">Nonetheless he had held the unseaworthy condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.930" offset="13507062">And this theory that I think generated from the Fifth Circuit to the effect that there must be some time element in order for this negligent act or none negligent act to ripen into unseaworthy condition is just fiction and has no basis on any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.767" offset="13598490">And just because you have to condition and the causation occurring at the same time or seconds apart is the condition itself thats important.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.175" offset="14468054">Now you did squarely hold that an instantaneous operational negligence created unseaworthy condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.540" offset="14505566">And you held it just as clearly as anything as any decision youve ever pronounced from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.050" offset="14527613">Because the lower court found a finding of fact, number 35 that says that the operational negligence occurred, the equipment was seaworthy and it occurred so instantaneously that the officer couldnt warn -- give him a warning whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.131" offset="14591875">It occurred then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.806" offset="14598562">And now the Court denied a liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3640.128" offset="14663868">And it makes that you dont have to have this lapse of time, when you say it must precede the grease dropping and stepping back on or someone steeping momentarily thereafter on the grease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.680" offset="14710053">But it makes no difference whether it was there in a matter of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.208" offset="14824155">You held it in Mascuilli, you did have the same question before this and thats what you did hold in absolutely no uncertain terms.</text>
