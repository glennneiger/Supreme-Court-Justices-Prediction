            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="29.394" offset="220975">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.286" offset="240515">The United States asked the Court to review this case because it seemed to us that the decision of the Court of Claims was inconsistent with and threatened to undermine clearly and repeatedly expressed the congressional policies regarding the jurisdiction and the business of the Indian Claims Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.977" offset="339257">From the outset, Congress has imposed explicit limitations on the Commission’s jurisdiction and has specified that it is a temporary tribunal whose business is to be completed within a fixed period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.543" offset="409579">It was originally established with a life span of 10 years and legislation enacted in 1946 and in a course of three, five-year extensions of the life of the Commission, Congress has shown increasing impatience to see the Commission’s business concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="498709">We express this legislative history in our brief and the current state of the Commission’s business indicates that it is unlikely that, that business will be concluded when the present life of the Commission expires in April of 1972 but we feel in light of the congressional policies expressed, we are oblige to try to see that, that business is expedited.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.346" offset="616782">We reproduced on page 12 of our petition for certiorari in this case some statistics about the present state of the Commission’s business.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.915" offset="658996">At the time we filed the petition in August 1970, 158 Commission cases had proceeded to judgment at which 81 in addition to the present of case had been settled by compromise, and a 159 cases remained to be disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.242" offset="744364">There has, to the best of our knowledge, been a changed in the status of only two cases in the intervening months, so that now 160 of the cases have proceeded to judgment and 157 remained to be disposed of.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="176.068" offset="807685">How does this Court move into this, are we suppose to speed them up?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="181.852" stopTime="819.504">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="181.852" offset="830777">Well, we are attempting in this case to enable the Commission’s business to be concluded in accordance with this congressional policy by asking this Court to review and the Court agreed to review the Court of Claims decision which seemed to ask to undermine, to jeopardize this congressional policy in two ways, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.729" offset="942268">One is that it seemed to us to impair the finality of the judgment’s which have been arrived at in these cases particularly the judgment’s arrived at through the process of settlement and compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.484" offset="1013321">We believe the Court of Claims failed to properly respect the principles of res judicata in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.543" offset="1041533">And the second way in which this decision seemed to us to jeopardize these congressional policies was by impermissibly expanding the Commission’s jurisdiction beyond the statutory cut-off dates that Congress imposed on the Commission’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.062" offset="1127633">And if I may, I’ll proceed first to the res judicata issue in the case because under our view of the case that issue should be dispositive of the case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.530" offset="1201507">Now, there’s a lengthy background, historical background which I think need not be reviewed in detail, I have asked the clerk to distribute a map to each of the Justices which may illuminate a little bit just what we’re talking about here relative to the res judicata issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.341" offset="1308714">Much of the history was reviewed by this Court in a decision in volume 330 U.S. written by Mr. Justice Black called the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.597" offset="1373811">It’s 330 U.S. 169.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.946" offset="1395127">It was there noted that in 1868, a reservation was established by treaty arrangement with Confederated Bands of Utes which included all of the Ute Indians and that reservation was the entire large rectangular area on this map bordered in red and also in orange at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.386" offset="1512887">And the treaty specified that any change in the reservation must be approved by three quarters of the males of the entire Confederated Bands of Utes.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.434" offset="1569102">The first change that took place was in 1874, the so-called Brunot Cession which is not in dispute in the present case and that ceded to the United States the area, the rectangular area marked off in yellow-orange crayon in our map.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.945" offset="1683101">And remaining after the Brunot Cession which was approved by three quarters of the males of the entire Confederated Bands was the rest of the reservation which was all one undifferentiated Ute reservation at the time as it had been under the 1868 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.793" offset="1766588">The map that we have used includes numbers on it so-called Royce numbers which were later applied by Charles Royce who drew up this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.020" offset="1807444">This is a copy of Charles Royce’s map drawn in 1896 but at the time, there was no such thing as Royce Areas there was only the one undifferentiated Ute Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.263" offset="1868466">Then by an agreement reached in 1880 as a result of the massacre which occurred at the Meeker Agency in the northern portion of the reservation and this too was reviewed in this Court’s previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.679" offset="1938056">There was in effect a forced sale of this entire reservation to the United States and the language of the 1880 agreement ceded the reservation to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.794" offset="2022588">We have it reproduced in our brief in the appendix to our brief the legislation which is found in volume 21 of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.133" offset="2071907">It was an agreement between the Confederated Bands of Utes which include the respondents in this case and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.044" offset="2107538">And on page 44 of our brief, we find the relevant language of the chiefs and headmen, I'm reading the last full paragraph now of the Confederated Bands, agree to use their best efforts to procure the consent, had to be consent of three quarters of the males to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Reservation in Colorado with the exception of provisions for settlement by individual Indians in severalty and in the case of the Utes in the southern portion that settlement was to be made along the La Plata River in Colorado which is the area shaded in green on our map and if there was insufficient land there for the allotments in severalty to the individual Indians then they were to be settled under the La Plate River and it's vicinity in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.354" offset="2380779">That language is right at the bottom of page 44 of the statute and repeatedly the statute refers to this proviso all to the session of all of the lands as a proviso for allotments in severalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.949" offset="2459146">That language is used on page 45 at the beginning of the third paragraph allotments and severalty of said lands and at the very bottom of that page the land that should be divided among the said Indians in severalty, and again at the bottom of page 46 that the reference to settlement in severalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.116" offset="2571786">And accordingly, in this Court’s previous decision dealing with the treaty at page 174 of volume 330 of the U.S. Reports after the relevant language of the treaty as quoted, this Court said quite succinctly, “This Act authorize specific allotments to individual Indians from the lands so ceded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="655.798" offset="2726536">The Court referred to this as the land ceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.256" offset="2740433">All of the lands of then present reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.076" offset="2767705">The dominant intent of those who sponsored this legislation and this treaty was to extinguish reservation life for the Ute Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.479" offset="2817337">This is clear from the reports and from the legislative history which we cite extensively in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.201" offset="2848162">This was partly for retaliatory reasons of the massacre and partly it represented prevalence of the view that many held at the time that it was wasteful of land to try to maintain the Indians in their aboriginal state that they should be settled on homestead size plots to be farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.437" offset="2949099">Views were expressed by some who opposed the legislation that the Indians weren’t ready for this kind of settlement but those views did not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.919" offset="2999045">The Act was enacted and the agreement was duly ratified by the Ute Indians, by the Confederated Band which included the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.626" offset="3041886">There were subsequently legislation which was not referred to in the course of the settlement agreement in 1950 in which we rely and which I will refer to just briefly in the historical part of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.989" offset="3111372">We refer to the subsequent legislation at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.718" offset="3126209">The 1882 Act was a very short statute which provided for the first time for the line to be surveyed which appears as the dotted line on our map.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.496" offset="3189321">This was necessary because all of the Utes in the northern part of the ceded reservation had been removed to Utah and therefore that part of the reservation was ready for settlement by non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.138" offset="3275943">But the allotments had not yet been made to the Utes in the southern portion the so-called Southern Utes including the respondents and the settlement could not be made by the non-Indians until after the individual allotments had been made and therefore it was necessary to survey a line to cutoff the southern portion so that the northern portion could be open to non-Indian settlement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="841.187" offset="3468100">Well, the fact is that the Indians were still in the entire southern area.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.550" offset="3485550">They had not yet been settled along the La Plata valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.023" offset="3499447">The Southern area therefore was not a practical matter ready for settlement by the white settlers and that was why Congress said that this line should be drawn so that the northern part could be opened for settlements for homesteading and for sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.105" offset="3587741">In the 1895 legislation which then ensued the House Report which we quote on page 9 of our brief refer to the Southern Indians “anomalous condition of having ceded their reservation” that was the word used “having ceded their reservation and yet remaining upon it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="897.843" offset="3694738">And for that reason Congress decided that a reservation should be restored to the Southern Utes and for the first time a Southern Ute reservation was established by the Act of 1895 which we refer to and reproduce in the appendix to our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.418" offset="4165047">Now this is of significance because of the settlement agreement of that we think of the Court of Claims should have honored in our plea of res judicata in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.945" offset="4231189">That settlement agreement which was formalized in the Court of Claims judgment was added into in 1950 the relevant portions of it are set forth on pages 98 and 99 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.375" offset="4316871">In these excerpts, these indented excerpts that appear in Judge Skelton’s dissenting opinion on the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.691" offset="4350098">The judgment entered was entered, you notice in the first excerpt has full settlement in payment for the complete extinguishment of plaintiffs’ right, title, interest, estate, claims, and demands of whatsoever in nature to the land ceded by the plaintiffs to the defendant by the Act of 1880 and after a schedule of lands was included in the settlement agreement the portion on page 99 says that the judgment is res judicata not only as to the land described in this settlement but whether included there in or not also as to any land formerly owned or claim by the plaintiffs in Western Colorado ceded to defendant by the Act of June 15, 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.208" offset="4564198">Now the respondents were parties to that settlement agreement and the four cases that were settled in that judgment after several years of negotiation and compromise between the Government and the present counsel for the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.487" offset="4629295">The Confederated Bands of Utes including the Southern Utes were awarded almost $32 million in settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.437" offset="4665135">Judge Skelton estimates that this amounted to $15,600.00 per individual Indian not for family but for individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.809" offset="4710588">The settlement provided pursuant to stipulation of the tribes that 40% of the award would go to the Southern Utes including the respondents and this is a recited in Section 672 of Title 25 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.593" offset="4801703">It seems significant to us that although the respondents now claimed that no Southern Ute lands were involved in that settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.774" offset="4842454">Their percentage of the award that’s 40% was larger than the one third which was specified in the 1880 agreement in legislation as the share that the Southern Utes were to take in proceeds under that agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.605" offset="4945795">As a matter of fact, the settlement agreement recited very specifically and this is at page 43 of volume 117 in the Court of Claims “such judgment shall be final adjudication of all issues between the plaintiffs and the defendant in the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.966" offset="5039208">It recited this, as to each of the settlements, I’m quoting the one that’s directly relevant here, appears on 438 of volume 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.488" offset="5081318">But also of great significance in our view is the context in which this settlement and judgment were reached, the context of contemporaneous litigation in this Court between the same parties represented by the same counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.704" offset="5154147">On pages 11 and 12 of our brief, we cite a Council for the Utes repeated an emphatic representations in that case, in the complaint and in the briefs and the case that's in volume 330 U.S. that the 1880 agreement had ceded to the Government all of the consolidated bands, Colorado lands except for the individual allotments in severalty which were provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.387" offset="5284968">And is noted in our brief, this was also the view taken in previous Court of Claims cases and the Government in it's brief in that case in this Court acknowledged the correctness of this representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.837" offset="5350693">Moreover, this Court in language which we quote in our brief on page 25 of our brief and I think this is very significant, this Court specifically referred to the then pending Court of Claims litigation which reached settlement three years later in 1950 and said in the language that we quote there in the middle of page 25 of our brief, “except for 13 treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid are those to the North of an outside the 1868 treaty reservation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.509" offset="5545357">And the Court in that case this case rejected their claim for payment for those lands that were north of the treaty reservation, the original treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.003" offset="5587362">And the Court went on to say it is considered that petitioners, the Confederated Utes including the respondents have either been or are currently pressing litigation in the Court of Claims by which they seek to be compensated for the White River Valley lands and in fact for all of the land which was contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation and that is the entire large rectangle on the map which of course includes the lands in the southern strip for which the Court of Claims upheld in additional reward in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.733" offset="5758307">Now we emphasize this language, we believe that was correct but we emphasized this language not because there’s no possibility that this Court could have been an error in saying this but because this language was based on representations of the same counsel who then negotiated the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.912" offset="5863006">They were aware of what this Court had held and had said in the case 1947, and it seems inconceivable to us at least that counsel, aware that the Court had said this about the litigation then pending, would enter into a settlement agreement using this broad language referring to all of the lands ceded in 1880 Act without reservation of any other claims, a settlement which recite that it’s a final adjudication of everything that was of issue in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.237" offset="6004276">It seems inconceivable to us that counsel would enter into such a settlement agreement using that language in the context of this Court’s recent opinion if they had mend to reserve further claims to the southern lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.902" offset="7678934">I'm having a chart brought in if I may so that as Mr. Wallace says the history of the treatment by the United States of the Confederated Bands in Ute Indians -- Confederated Bands of Ute Indians by the United States is somewhat complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.254" offset="7768377">I would like to use this to give a picture as we see it and as it relates to the case before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.482" offset="7809337">Like the Government’s sketch, this is adopted from Royce 1896 Bureau of Ethnology report interpretation of Indian land sessions in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.153" offset="7867956">Prior to 1868, the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians who were composed of the White River Band the Uncompahgre Band, and the Southern Ute Band occupied in the usual Indian fashion a tremendous area in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.152" offset="7955937">In 1868, the Confederated Bands, the three units comprising Confederated Bands agreed to limit its area of occupation to the outside perimeters shown on this sketch approximately or just slightly lower than 16 million hectares.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.171" offset="8080071">Somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.692" offset="8098147">In 1873, as counsel has explained, there is a highly mineralized area found in the location of Colorado which is identified here as Royce Area 566.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.512" offset="8153422">The United States obtained from the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians and an agreement to cede that that was ceded in 1873 and ratified by an Act of Congress of 1874.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.450" offset="8209220">The next Act of course is the agreement between the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians in the United States an agreement which was worked out by nine representatives of the three bands constituting with Confederated Bands of Ute Indians over a period of several weeks in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.655" offset="8286020">As indicated, it was decided by the people of Colorado and probably people and Congress that the Confederated Bands be removed from Colorado because of many things but because eventually of the Meeker Massacre which occurred in 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.058" offset="8355610">That agreement provided that the chiefs and headmen of the Confederated Bands would exercise their most persuasive powers to get their people to agree to a cession of lands indicated in what I call the 1868 reservation that agreement had to be ratified or accepted by three quarters of the male adult Utes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.859" offset="8482774">It was to be brought back to Congress for ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.722" offset="8502209">It provided for assessment of the 1868 reservation with two extremely important exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.893" offset="8530944">One was is it provided that the Uncompahgre Band which occupied generally the middle area of the 1868 reservation was to be provided with land on the Grand River near the mouth of the Gunnison River in a western portion of middle section of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.843" offset="8614745">The other important exception on the one which determines this case, there’s the fact that I preserved for the Southern Ute area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.288" offset="9096547">Whether it was reserve for the Southern Utes, that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.888" offset="9114937">The 1882 Act came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.759" offset="9126431">There was concern in the Attorney General to Congress that it did not dispose under the public land laws, the area indicated a 616 without additional legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.557" offset="9173556">Congress responded with two facts in the 1882 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.742" offset="9194350">First it opened area 616 to dispose along under the public land laws and it provided for a line to be drawn between the area to be dispose of under that Act and the area occupied by the Southern Ute Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.694" offset="9274180">That line was drawn as I indicate from the Southwest corner of Royce Area 566 to the boundary of the territory in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.139" offset="9327888">Now from that period on from 1882 until 1895, in every session of Congress save one, in most days most of the Congress has had three sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.538" offset="9377520">There was legislation pending concerning the treatment and disposition of the Southern Utes and their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.236" offset="9412315">When it came along the 1888, Congress passed a law which established to Commission to negotiate with the Southern Utes for preservation or settlement of their treaty and other rights including the possibility of exchange of “their reservation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.240" offset="9504371">Their reservation meant only Royce Area 617.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.545" offset="9533524">They reached agreement with the Utes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.889" offset="9542928">The Utes agreed to the Southern Utes to trade that area for an area in Utah territory three times as large as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.947" offset="9583156">There was objection from the citizens in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.369" offset="9600815">The Utes were sort of unwanted people at this time even the territory of New Mexico didn’t want them to move there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.143" offset="9627982">But this agreement in 1888 which provided for exchange of that reservation for the exchange for the land in Utah was reached by the Commission and it passed the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.206" offset="9692244">It died in a House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.674" offset="9702066">Still there was a continuation of legislative effort throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.862" offset="9726830">In about 1893 or 1894, Congress sort of changed this direction toward the handling of the Southern Ute reservation and I might say that during all of this time, there was adequate, an apple administrative recognition of the ownership of the area Royce 617 involved on the part of administrative officers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.717" offset="9834245">When 1895 came along, Congress had some slight heat or tension to the Act of 1880 by saying that the property involved in the Royce Area 617 should be handled as provided by the 1880 treaty as herein provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.699" offset="9950124">It then changed direction considerably from what it had done in the 1880 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.645" offset="9977919">The 1880 Act had provided for instance the proceeds from the lands to be sold in the Royce Area 616 should be divided three ways between the White Rivers, the Uncompahgre, and the Southern Utes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.093" offset="10043747">In 1895, and even though the treaty of 1868 had required that any session of Ute land obtain permission from three quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.564" offset="10093589">The male, adults of the bands involved it provided possibly different factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.950" offset="10135176">First, it created the divisions between Royce Area 617.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.747" offset="10170389">It said, those members of the Southern Ute Tribe who elect and are qualified to receive allotments shall be allotted in the area at the east end of this track as to those who did not elect or were not qualified, the Government would create and reserve for them a reservation in a 40-mile track in the western end of Royce Area 617.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.305" offset="10304554">Congress didn’t require the three quarters of the male, adult Utes vote for this required only a majority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.297" offset="10340603">It also provided that within six months following the passage of that Act, the President should arrange for the allotments for those to be allotted in the eastern end and the balance should be sold under the public land lost at not less than $1.25 per acre.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.465" offset="10717184">This was on of the factors which caused Congress to give this problem so much consideration also caused the administrative officers to be so concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.073" offset="10763682">The Southern Utes were setting on a strip of land these 15 miles wide and advancing settlement was encroaching on all sides especially to the north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.389" offset="10816972">The City of Durango which was in the session of 1873 along in 1895 had reached the population 4,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.403" offset="10856991">The administrators were concerned that friction would develop between a non-Indians and Indians and this is one of the reasons there were access to remove the Southern Utes from what the administrative officers considered a small, slender portion of land on which there to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.407" offset="10937031">Now the area on the east which was not allotted was put up for sale and in the 1902, Congress passed another Act which is called the Free Homestead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.305" offset="11000560">Now the 1895 Act which provided for the allotting in the east provided that after the deduction of expenses of sale, the remainder, the proceeds should be saved and put in trust for the benefit of the Southern Utes and the Southern Utes only; another clear indication of the congressional recognition that Royce Area 617 was Southern Ute territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.656" offset="11114036">Now, two administrative decisions came along in 1903 and 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.048" offset="11139532">1903 one man sought a homestead in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.643" offset="11157922">He used history, the fact that this had been ceded by the Act of 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.215" offset="11184253">His application was denied, reviewed and denied by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.578" offset="11205674">The same application type of application was made under the Minerals Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.444" offset="11237125">And again was denied by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.010" offset="11251440">And the final main Act which shows beyond any doubt that this area, Royce Area 617 was preserved for the Southern Utes and was not ceded by the Act of 1880 is a fact that in that year, the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to provisions the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 restored to the Southern Ute Tribe in excess of 300,000 acres of land in the eastern section of Royce Area 617 which had not been disposed of under the public land laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.903" offset="11414967">In the meantime, between 1900 and 1938, the United States Government had given away free to homesteaders in excess of 225,000 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.335" offset="11480691">And it did this in clear violation of the Act of 1895 which provided for sale of that land to settlers at not less than $1.25 per acre, the balance to be saved and held in trust for the Southern Utes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.641" offset="11557909">Now, the Government says we ignore all of this history.</text>

            <text syncTime="4127.995" offset="16615320">Well that is a misprint, I’m sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.581" offset="16625664">The word should be “sole” and the sole exceptions were unoccupied agricultural lands on the La Plata River, agricultural lands on Grand River, etcetera for individual allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.051" offset="16691597">That is the representation that the Ute Band made at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.889" offset="16710928">They’re now claiming that that reservation in the 1880 Act was for a reservation for the Southern Ute Tribe but it seems to me that in light of what they had said in the 1947 litigation and what this Court had said that the stipulation in 1950 would have read quite differently if they had meant to reserve Southern Ute Lands from that settlement.</text>
