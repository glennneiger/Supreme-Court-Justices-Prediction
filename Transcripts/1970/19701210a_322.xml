            <text syncTime="16.213" offset="64784">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.987" offset="79935">This case raises the same constitutional issue as to proceeding case in reverse raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.180" offset="108669">The question is whether due process requires the right to jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.856" offset="135419">However, the facts in this case are somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.141" offset="152555">Both Joseph McKeiver and Edward Terry were tried after the date of this Court’s decision in Duncan versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.106" offset="188395">Both were 15-years old at the time of their trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.605" offset="206367">Under Pennsylvania juvenile court law, both of them stood the risk of confinement until they were 21-years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.417" offset="237610">So that at the time of the trial, a possible outcome was that they would be confined until they were 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.673" offset="266658">Unfortunately, the institutions in which they risk confinement are far from being as attractive as those described for the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.244" offset="304901">The worst of the institutions to which Philadelphia juveniles can withstand is a place called Camp Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.223" offset="328829">Camp Hill is a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.174" offset="336666">It has been described as a prison by Justice Hoffman of our Superior Court who for many years was an outstanding juvenile court judge.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="92.308" offset="369162">Well, returning to what Mr. Justice White raised in the previous argument that you heard, what’s the connection between the kind of institutions and the constitutional issue involved here?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel E. Farmer</label>
            <text syncTime="106.885" offset="427468">It seems to me that if it could be proven overwhelmingly that there was no punishment, that in fact the juvenile court was an exact parallel to the model of let us say a mental commitment proceeding rather than the stigmatizing for the commission of crime and punishment type of proceeding that it is, there might be some question as to the right.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="129.584" offset="518269">You don’t think confinement alone under the -- without more is enough to trigger the constitutional claim for a jury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_e_farmer" startTime="140.267" stopTime="254.609">
            <label>Mr. Daniel E. Farmer</label>
            <text syncTime="140.267" offset="561006">I think it might be Your Honor but I don’t think I have to maintain that because I think it’s so clear from the -- both the facts in Pennsylvania and the materials found in the National Crime Commission, studies of our juvenile court system that in fact that it is not a genuinely rehabilitative system.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.845" offset="627357">It closely approximate a system of finding out about wrongs and imposing punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.661" offset="670616">Joseph McKeiver was charged with robbery, larceny and receiving stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.494" offset="697887">These are felonies under the penal code of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.283" offset="713038">Robbery carries an adult penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.996" offset="735922">Larceny carries an adult penalty of imprisonment for up to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.342" offset="765283">Edward Terry was charged with assault and battery and conspiracy, those are misdemeanors which for an adult carry imprisonment penalties of up to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.927" offset="823693">One of the contentions made by the opponents is that juvenile court judges view their role in fact finding as something very different than their role when they are sitting as juvenile court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.600" offset="886387">But I respectfully direct the Court’s attention to page 16 of the appendix where the Court makes the finding and the Court says and I quote, “the Court adjudicates him delinquent of larceny and robbery, does not adjudicate the juvenile delinquent of receiving stolen goods”.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.341" offset="961306">So its clear that the Court’s frame of mind as it approaches solely the fact finding issue is very much the frame of mind of a judge when he is trying the facts in an adult criminal case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="254.609" stopTime="276.002">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="254.609" offset="1018358">Well, how could he do it any other way when there are multiple specific acts of delinquency alleged?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.379" offset="1069453">Wouldn’t the whole process be worse off if he didn’t pinpoint his findings?</text>

            <text syncTime="277.989" offset="1111876">All I’m saying is that the process in the juvenile court, a fact finding is almost identical even in terms of the mental processes through which the judge must go with what the judge goes through in an adult bench trial for the same crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.928" offset="1191706">Edward Terry was committed to a state correctional institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.864" offset="1991367">The County Court which was formally a court of general jurisdiction but limited civilly, those judges became judges of the family division of the court of common pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.116" offset="2040372">So that the present judges of the family division are judges who used to be judges of a court of general jurisdiction but with limits on the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.331" offset="2089273">The issue that seems to have drawn the most fire from the other side and which seems to be at the heart of this case is whether or not the grant of the right to jury trial will interfere in those distinctive features of the juvenile court process which hold out promise that the system may in the future become genuinely rehabilitative.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.155" offset="2180598">I would like to go through the juvenile court process step by step to persuade this Court that the bulk indeed almost all of the juvenile court process that relates to, its rehabilitative purposes will not be touched by jury trials which affect only fact finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.266" offset="2477035">The fact finding -- the features of the juvenile court which distinguish and which hopefully will someday lead to it becoming a genuinely rehabilitative system are first that it has a socialized intake procedure, that is when an arresting officer comes in with an offense, he maybe able to make out that the crime was committed but an employee of the juvenile court may decide that there will not be a delinquency petition filed but the case will be adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.834" offset="2583301">The juvenile court judge has a broad range of alternatives available to him in terms of disposition of the juvenile prior to the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.675" offset="2666684">Finally, when we turn to the trial itself, there’s a great deal of talk from the other side about jury trials ripping out the socialized process of the juvenile court, jury trials interfering with the juvenile court judge’s ability to guide and mold the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.227" offset="2732826">Juvenile jury trials injecting formality into the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.410" offset="2757590">Those ideas have tremendous evocative power but when we turn to analyze them in detail, I think it can be seen that the -- those notions what the judge can actually do are not going to be adversely affected by agreeing of the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.118" offset="2828434">In its brief, the national council to juvenile judges suggested as its only concrete meaning to guiding and molding by the juvenile judge that the juvenile judge will no longer be able to make findings of delinquency on hearsay evidence but 1202 in its right to confrontation and cross examination is now precluding findings of delinquency based on hearsay evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.360" offset="3613362">To return to the point of the judge’s discretion in the fact finding hearing, the heart of his discretion it seems to me the only real legitimate discretion he has left in the fact finding is this power to find that in fact the juvenile committed the act which would be delinquency but to abstain in the social best interest of the juvenile from entering on the record an adjudication of delinquency, a jury trial won’t change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.197" offset="3716702">As I envisioned it, the jury will return a piece of paper which says we find that the facts alleged in the delinquency petition are established beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.961" offset="3755781">At that point, the judge is still free to make his own determination of whether the child’s best interest requires an adjudication of delinquency or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.313" offset="3797159">He could even suspend the adjudication of delinquency pending some probationary period.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.921" offset="3823595">That’s all the juvenile court judge can do now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.935" offset="4339670">It’s argued that such a backlog will be created, that there will be a long gap between when the juvenile first enters the system and when the juvenile is tried and that the rapid changes in his personality will interfere with rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.892" offset="4407484">I think that the brief of the public defender of Washington DC shows quite well that the experience in the states granting the right statutorily has been that very few jury trials are requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.097" offset="4468297">In the District of Columbia, there has been a very special problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.333" offset="4481254">There had been a lot of request for jury trials and a serious backlog has been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.499" offset="4501943">And the Congress worried about that backlog and in the belief that the backlog was created by the number of jury trial requests repealed the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.997" offset="4539977">However, on page 17 of the amicus brief of the public defender of Washington, they cite a professional management study that was made at the District of Columbia juvenile court and the conclusion of that study was and this conclusion was not available to the Congress, the conclusion of that study was that contrary to the notion Congress had in its mind when they repealed the right that the reason there was a backlog was because there was not proper calendar control, not because there was a large number of request for jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.378" offset="4673411">So I think that in repealing the right to jury trial, Congress acted under a misapprehension of fact because it did not have that study available to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.701" offset="6122789">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.898" offset="6139507">Starting with the decisions in Gault, Winship and Duncan, I would submit to Your Honors that there is implicit in the rationale of those cases, the conclusion that jury trials are not required for juvenile proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.654" offset="6206589">That in Gault, this court said that due process of law does not require displacing the substantive benefits of the juvenile court process and this Court further said that the features of the juvenile court system are not to be impaired by constitutional domestication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.422" offset="6285688">I think that what the Court referred to as it amplified its opinion and rationale in Gault was precisely this issue which is here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.325" offset="6325290">And the same import was present in the Winship opinion with the language that there was to be no effect on the formality, flexibility or speed of the juvenile court process and as the juvenile court process is taken up and come to groups with, it is precisely those factors reserved in Winship which militate against the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.476" offset="6413897">The same thing I submit to Your Honors is President Duncan, one of the footnotes, there is a reference to the conclusion that there is to be no widespread change in the criminal process in the state and that this Court could encompass and envision an entirely fair process without the juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.200" offset="6488712">I think that brings us right to the central question which is presented in this case as to what the difference would be if there is a jury trial I suppose to a bench trial in the juvenile process and I would suggest to Your Honors that there would be a great loss in the intimacy of the proceeding, if you have a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.402" offset="6581603">Yesterday, the question was raised in the North Carolina case as to whether the matter would be public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.406" offset="7353574">I know of no occasion when someone has complained about the military obtaining a record and I know of no such request and I think it would be the procedure of our juvenile court not to let anybody have those records because I think that would be an improper disclosure under our juvenile court law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.689" offset="7422746">But this entire area of disclosure of records has just not been raised or litigated on the Philadelphia scene and we have raised and litigated virtually every -- many, many issues involving the allegation of improper police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.076" offset="7484291">Returning if I may, to the central question as to just what kind of a trial you have with the jury as contrasted with the judge alone, I would submit to Your Honors that there would be at least four factors which would come into play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.150" offset="7548552">As I would characterize them, the factor of intimacy, the father figure, the general flexibility and the aspect of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.014" offset="7580003">With respect to the question of intimacy where there is a bench trial and a judge dissents and the juvenile is before them, there is a straight line between that judge and that juvenile and it is vastly different when you bring a jury into a courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.520" offset="7650011">As soon as the jury is in the courtroom, then there is the immediate import of the tactics of acquittal and quite properly so under our judicial system, the thrust of the lawyer for the defense is to do everything he can to secure an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.224" offset="7720856">When there is a proceeding before a judge alone, lawyers respond very differently and so do those who are there to be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.699" offset="7762756">There is much less emphasis upon excluding material and now I’m talking about material which may properly be before a judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.827" offset="12415269">We have a practice in Pennsylvania of having the waiver signed at the time of trial, must be signed by the trial judge before whom the case goes.</text>
