            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in number 31 original, the State of Utah against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.543" offset="225573">Mr. Strauss, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="34.667" offset="242082">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.108" offset="259845">This is a case in this Court's original jurisdiction which was brought by the State of Utah under authority granted by the Congress to determine whether the United States or Utah prior to a quitclaim deed given by the United States, had title to the lands lying below the meander line of the Great Salt Lake which is a shallow and very salty body of water of some size lying wholly within the State of Utah in its northern portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.892" offset="394951">After a variety of procedural rulings which I need not to remind the Court of.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.711" offset="418252">The case was referred to Special Master, the Honorable J. Cullen Ganey to report to this Court on the issue of the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.740" offset="454301">That issue has several aspects and then the proceedings immediately had had, he decided only one of those which is whether the Great Salt Lake was a navigable body of water on the day when Utah became a State, January 4, 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.660" offset="525981">And the parties have fully agreed that if the Great Salt Lake was not navigable on that day, then the United States continued its ownership of all the lands below the meander line and in that situation, further proceedings will eventually be required to determine if the market value of the lands which have subsequently been quickclaimed to Utah, so that Utah may pay that value for the quitclaim deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.295" offset="632560">If on the other hand, the Great Salt Lake was navigable on that day in January 1896 then the lake that passed to Utah at that time, instant as part of the operation of the Principle of Equal Footing or Equality Among the States, then is no necessity for Utah to pay for lands which were within the boundaries of the lake as they existed on that day, save possibly for such lands as have been since relicted by the recession of the lake from its shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.561" offset="781667">And the issues where the boundaries of the lake were on January 4, 1896 and whether the United States continued entitle or obtain title to such lands as might have relicted after that date, again, is an issue which is not before the Court at this time and which would have to be decided in a subsequent proceeding if the Court should rule for Utah in the present proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.004" offset="883440">And I might just very briefly remark in that connection, that while the report of the special master is in some minor respect possibly seems to rule on the reliction issue on the one hand in conclusion of law 18 or in the proposed decree to state that if the lake was navigable, Utah obtained titles to all lands within the meander line, I think it is clear and that counsel for Utah will agree that the issues are as I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.157" offset="1020008">The question of reliction remains open for future decision and if the lake was navigable on January 4th, the lands which Utah took at that time were the lands which were under the lake's waters at that time and not the lands which might have happen to be within the meander line which had been drawn at some earlier time.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="249.545" offset="1101511">Does this mean Mr. Strauss, that if Utah should prevail here that the proposed decree of the Special Master would not be proper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="263.334" stopTime="491.469">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="263.334" offset="1156681">Well, I think it's question of construction, indeed whether the decree is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.241" offset="1176325">If it is susceptible to a reading then it's inconsistent with what I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.086" offset="1191685">This Court has always followed the practice in past of inviting proposals for decree after original cases and I -- we have been assuming it would do so in this case then we can confront the question at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.495" offset="1269321">Now, if I may turn to the issue which is here as I've said, the only issue is whether the Great Salt Lake was navigable on the day that Utah became a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.505" offset="1313416">There were hearings in Salt Lake City before the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.306" offset="1328567">Both oral testimony and numerous documents were produced and on that basis, the Special Master has prepared a lengthy report in which he concludes that the lake is navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.670" offset="1370049">And while we dispute that final conclusion, I should make it clear as I think our brief does that on the whole we acknowledge that the report is correct and the statement to the fact strictly speaking of the case we think the Master has done an excellent job and don't mean by arguing legal points here to suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.540" offset="1465553">We accept all the strictly factual findings made in the report and have made exceptions only the findings of law and to two of the findings of fact which in our view, embody essentially mixed questions of law and of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.573" offset="1521664">We contend that the lake was not navigable for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.075" offset="1535666">The first is that the lake presents such obstacles to navigation in its natural state that it could never be used as a channel of useful commerce and trade by water without improvements of an unusual extent being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.021" offset="1599404">And the second is that even if the lake were navigable, in fact, it lacks any connection in interstate or foreign commerce or trade and for that reason, it should be found not navigable in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.705" offset="1650186">Taking up the question of navigability in fact again, the parties are largely in agreement of what the underlying law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.446" offset="1681115">The proper test was first stated by this Court in the Daniel Ball in 10 Wallace and the Court said there that waters are navigable, in fact, when they are used or are susceptible of being used in their ordinary condition as highways for commerce over which trade and travel are or maybe conducted in the customary mode of trade and travel on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.960" offset="1783202">And I think the Court will find that the principal dispute here is what that word susceptible means.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.991" offset="1807339">Perhaps, some argument about the extent to which improvements may occur without departing from the ordinary conditions of waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.098" offset="1847777">And what the Court meant when it said, that they must be useful as highways for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.501" offset="1873377">The master did not find that the Great Salt Lake was actually in use as a highway for commerce on January 4, 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.683" offset="1910053">He found only that it was capable or susceptible of such use.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.548" offset="1929592">Not counting excursion trips which have been made he found the boating uses of the lake have been more of a private nature rather than by individual contractors for hire, that's finding of fact 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.078" offset="1983718">In finding of fact 52, he's found no evidence to show that there was ever any regularly scheduled freight or passenger service operated on the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.562" offset="2025618">So, the question is whether it's reasonable to believe that this lake in its ordinary natural condition could become a highway of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.413" offset="2057070">The master's report on the whole is a discussion of that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.469" offset="2069295">Did he find what the ordinary and natural condition was, Mr. Strauss, for finding on that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="498.406" offset="2096985">I -- he found that on that date, the lake was approximately 77 miles long and taking its greatest length about 33 miles wide and exposed approximately 100 and -- excuse me, 15,000 square miles of water and to the sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.268" offset="2168456">That its elevation, there is some confusion, I think there's a typographical error at one point but I think it's clear that he found that its elevation at statehood was 4,201 feet which would give it, at its greatest depth, the depth of 30 feet, an average depth of 13 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.365" offset="2256854">We have submitted to the clerk and to counsel and asked him to distribute to you a small map of the lake to which I'll be referring later on in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="549.535" offset="2301471">What I was really getting at it is what is meant by body of water in its natural state or condition as applied to this lake?</text>

            <text syncTime="561.220" offset="2348283">Well basically, perhaps the simplest way to answer it would be to refer to this Court's decision in the Montello which involved the Fox River.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.885" offset="2386944">The Fox River was a body river which had water -- which had existed in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.822" offset="2410663">Would transport boats of two-and-a-half foot depths down it for a considerable distance, although, there was some rapids and riffles to be gone through.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.037" offset="2455489">It had been improved by the time a case got to this Court, questioning whether it was a navigable waterway or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.615" offset="2485791">And in deciding whether it was a navigable waterway, the Court said, “We will not concern ourselves with those improvements, with those canals, ditches, locks and so forth, but rather with the river as it was when man found it, unimproved, unexcavated, entrenched” and the issue was whether in those circumstances, it could carry trade and commerce and the Court found that these boats of two-and-a-half foot depths carrying substantial loads of lumber and other goods, in fact, frequently ran the river engaging in commerce of a very substantial sort on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.874" offset="2650885">And so --</text>

            <text syncTime="637.783" offset="2654542">A lot of the or to say a lot pf -- there are there few methods of I gather of traveling in very shallow waters and I remember down the everglades with these aired propel boats?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_strauss" startTime="651.274" stopTime="672.730">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="651.274" offset="2708459">That's right, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.931" offset="2715146">Thankfully, again, 1896 perhaps is helpful to us in that respect that it's quite clear from the cases that the question of navigation is with the means of navigation which were available at the time and I don't believe that an airboat would have been available in 1896.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.447" offset="2805112">I think it may also be -- I think another appropriate response to that of course one has today amphibious trucks of enormous dimension and hovercraft and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.610" offset="2861850">Virtually no case which this Court has decided would not involve a body of water which couldn't be navigated by one or another of those crafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.612" offset="2905840">The United States versus Oregon, for example, the waters in those lakes were in some places only inches deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.022" offset="2931440">Quite plainly, one of these airboats could've navigated those waters as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="710.729" offset="2946278">Of course here, the master very clearly found that as of the date of statehood in January 1896 the lake was physically capable of being used in its ordinary condition as a highway for floating and affording passage to watercraft in the manner over which trade and travel was or might be conducted in the customary modes of travel on water at that time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="765.258" offset="3164453">I think it might be appropriate at this time to refer to this map which I've asked the Clerk to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.272" offset="3196426">The think black outline, the thick line running around the periphery of the lake is the 4,200 foot line, it's a contour map, is approximately, slightly less, but approximately with the level that the lake was at statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.104" offset="3271764">The thick blue line is approximately the level that the state, that the lake is today, again, somewhat less.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.645" offset="3305932">The white areas then, between the blue line and the black line are areas which have been exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.467" offset="3341249">There is a -- since the time of statehood, there is a five-foot vertical difference involved between those two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.776" offset="3382523">So that I think one can say that the waters to which the master was referring in the passage which you have read are the waters within the blue line and it can be seen that indeed those waters do run virtually from the northern tip of the lake, to virtually the southern tip of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.671" offset="3458069">I think it can also be seen, however, that along the eastern and western shores of the lake as the master also specifically found, in particular behind Stansbury Island and Carrington Island in the lower left, and the whole of the Bear River Bay and then Farmington Bay along the right, that there is a very wide expanse of land which has been exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.279" offset="3564440">Now, to give you some notion of the extent of that land while the vertical scale here is five feet between the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.312" offset="3604668">The horizontal scale is eight feet to the inch or each one eighth of an inch represents one mile in horizontal dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.709" offset="3650226">I think the Court will see that there are considerable extents of water exposed -- of land exposed around the edge, where that horizontal scale is a quarter of an inch or greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.449" offset="3705187">Or in other words, where something on the order of -- takes something on the order of only a two-foot difference in depth over the course of a mile's horizontal distance and this is basically where the argument in the case rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.334" offset="3796720">It's true, one can go from one carefully selected point on the lake to another carefully selected point on the lake, but this is a lake and not a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.812" offset="3838621">With a river, one is only concerned with traveling the length of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.396" offset="3856906">Crossing the river is never a very great concern so far as navigability is -- when navigability is an issue and has never been at issue in this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.089" offset="3903718">But we don't think a lake is very useful for commerce, when you can't get out of the lake to any place else and when you can only visit one or two places upon its shores, that in essence is the contention of the United States here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.836" offset="7262751">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.983" offset="7279261">First, I would like to state that Utah does agree that the issue of reliction is not before the Court at this time, that the question is one of navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.699" offset="7338193">Utah further agrees that in order for the Great Salt Lake to be found navigable in January 4, 1896, it must have been navigable in its natural and ordinary condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.567" offset="7401618">We submit that the master so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.332" offset="7420740">We disagree with the United States in the interpretation of this language of susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.488" offset="7457311">We believe it to be clear on the Court's language in United States versus Holt State Bank, United States versus Utah, that actual use at statehood is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.806" offset="7522617">It is a capacity for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.509" offset="7533380">We believe, we showed a great deal more than a naked physical capacity, but we believe that that is all that was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.706" offset="7570160">That is does the body of water have sufficient length, width, depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.427" offset="7593044">Is it dependable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.505" offset="7597432">Is it there year in, year out?</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.870" offset="7606836">All seasons of the year?</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.821" offset="7618644">Could it be used if the need arises?</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.137" offset="7635884">In fact in the Holt State Bank case, the evidence was that Mud Lake as it was called, only enjoined -- enjoyed a very limited historical use and at the time of trial was drained and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.072" offset="7707669">It had absolutely no future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.273" offset="7720417">Consequently, any discussion as to what the future may hold as far as a build up of a commerce with boats going everywhere on the lake at various points is simply irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.601" offset="7781752">Title either vested on January 4, 1896 in Utah or it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.831" offset="7806725">It has been floating, waiting for experience to show what the traffic will be on the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.049" offset="7839535">This is why the Court has used and correctly so the very definitive test of susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.098" offset="7871718">Secondly, we believe that of course, the actual uses demonstrate a susceptibility very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.422" offset="7913096">The master found a variety of uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.936" offset="7923127">He found the great many different kinds of boats that have been used on the lake both before and after statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.177" offset="7952071">It's true, some were used for pleasure, but it's also true, some were used in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.063" offset="7979656">And again in United States versus Utah, this Court said that no matter what they use, it is still relevant to show the susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.986" offset="8027303">The United States in the earlier case made the very argument, it's making here that well too many of these uses are private in nature as opposed to being paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.427" offset="8069099">This Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.306" offset="8096580">Turning to the argument that there is no access to the like, that it is too difficult to get to, so that the otherwise usable capacity is made useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.950" offset="8179127">I would first refer to the map which counsel has submitted to the Court and point out that the Special Master found that Antelope Island had been continuously inhabited since 1848 and the witness which was spoken of earlier, Zela Walker Manning testified that she was born on that island in the early 1890's, lived there and that her testimony was that boats were used to transport livestock, household supplies, grain, farm equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.175" offset="8352057">This is across the very area which the United States says its too shallow to navigate and that you can't get your boat to the shore or off in the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.085" offset="8399705">The same as true of Freemont Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.983" offset="8407333">It has sustained a viable livestock industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.306" offset="8432619">Further as has already been noted, there are a number of places on the lake where the bed is deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.034" offset="8471489">We don't deny that there some pretty flat shores there and that there are some bogs, but again, we don't believe unlimited capacity is a requirement that you have to be able to get in at every spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.825" offset="8522689">Again, in United States versus Utah, this Court observed that the 65 miles of the Colorado River which it found to be navigable flowed through Rock Canyons for a large extent that had walls from 600 to 1,200 feet in height.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.439" offset="8621119">In the Mud Lake case, the Court concluded that that lake was navigable even though sand bars prevented the unrestricted use of the lake and here, the Special Master found that the shallow waters which are around the shore could easily be avoided by keeping into the navigable channels which he had found extended substantially throughout the length and width of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.101" offset="8743790">The point is that if someone needs to build a pier or build a harbor, there are some good spots to build them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.705" offset="8778167">This is not the type of artificial construction which takes a case out of the navigability for title purposes and puts it under the Commerce Clause definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.486" offset="8825292">We're not required to dredge the channel, do a lot of improvements, there is just simply harbor access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.382" offset="8860923">The Master found that there are very few natural harbors in the world and the one witness, in fact, the only witness who was an expert in navigation Mr. Thomas Lundy testified that he was familiar with many of the navigable waters of the United States as well as other parts of the world and was only aware of one natural harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.033" offset="8987460">Mr. Lundy was associated on the Great Salt Lake for a period of two years, where he was involved in the design, construction and operation of a fleet of 39 boats and barges that were used to place a causeway fill across the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.071" offset="9067708">And as a part of that project, it was necessary to construct a harbor on the Westside of the Promontory Mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.744" offset="9106369">He testified that rather than being an impediment, that the lake was unusually susceptible in this regard because it was easy, it was inexpensive to construct the harbor because of the clay sediments which made up the bed, the lack of bedrock that they -- I think that he mentioned that the harbor was 400 by 1,500 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.802" offset="9202604">He further testified that they had absolutely no maintenance problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.185" offset="9220159">The reason for this he said, is that the lake has no currents, so you don't the sediments moving back in like you do on most river systems and it is like you do in the harbors in the San Francisco Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.975" offset="9291316">Again on access, the Special Master found that a number of piers and docking facilities existed at various points on the southern shore and on the eastern shore of the lake.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.567" offset="11209644">There was debris, ice during times of the year and the most serious impediment, the shifting sand bars that these would cause the water to spread out, loose its depths and in that case, the evidence was that a good portion of the year, the water was only three feet deep, much, much less deep than the waters of the Great Salt Lake but still navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.537" offset="11317478">And that again, the shifting sand bars caused the channel to divide and shift around.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.192" offset="11372126">In fact and again as I was saying, the Court said that under the equal footing doctrine, because they were navigable, in fact, they were Utah's property and it was clear that the Court was not announcing or applying a new concept or a new doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.588" offset="11469720">This principle was already well-established by prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.594" offset="11513710">Utah further suggests on the question of interstate navigability, the argument of the United States on interstate navigability that whatever doubts may have existed before they were removed by the passage of the Submerged Lands Act, that the legislative history of that Act makes it very clear, that Congress was confirming and ratifying title in the states to inland waters which were intrastate and which were navigable in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.434" offset="11729063">So in summary, Utah would submit that the report, the findings of the Special Master are fully supported by the facts of the case that he did apply the correct rules of law, correct rationale of prior decisions of this Court and that his report and decree should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.370" offset="12104808">It was well settled at the time.</text>
