            <label>Mr. Philip J. Shea</label>
            <text syncTime="30.167" offset="224005">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.643" offset="229961">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.220" offset="240201">The issue raised by this appeal that a three-judge District Court sitting in Phoenix, Arizona by its decree of May 19, 1970, abused its discretion and committed error by refusing to assure a preliminary injunction to enjoin the operation of the admittedly unconstitutional reapportionment plan and the reapportionment was before the court enacted by a special session of a state legislature and signed into law on January 22, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.753" offset="378337">As in all prior apportionment statues before it, it stubbornly clung to the idea that reapportionment should be brought about on the basis of voter registration and not on the basis of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="432253">Now, the use of voter registration as distinguished from the use of population, of people in Arizona has a particularly invidious discriminatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.089" offset="495679">It probably would in any place because of poor people and certain minorities don’t register as much other people, as much as effluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.561" offset="525667">It is particularly so in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.243" offset="540296">The northeastern part of the State of Arizona which is one-sixth of a very large state, contains the highest concentration of Indians of any area in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.507" offset="597452">There are about 70,000 American Indians, Navajos and Hopis and some Apaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.460" offset="637262">The average sized district, the legislative district in Arizona is 54,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.316" offset="668609">The 70,000 people in the northeastern part, 70,000 Indians in northeastern Arizona are still under this reapportionment plan dominated by their white neighbors to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.769" offset="718451">In South Phoenix of this, a very poor area, it is mostly poor black, poor Mexican-American, poor white.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.889" offset="770905">In the legislative district in South Phoenix and it’s just one, there are 70,000 people in an area in northeastern Phoenix, an area which all white, an area which is affluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.371" offset="824822">There are 27,000 people, more than twice as many people in South Phoenix in a district as in northeastern Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.330" offset="860662">Now, this discrimination of course is invidious, of course it’s horrible and so we complain that Court committed error, it clearly abused its discretion by refusing to enjoin it.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.969" offset="907264">The voter registration as the basis of the apportionment of Arizona has along history.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.028" offset="923460">As matter of fact, it’s the only way we got the reapportion of legislature, at least the lower house, beginning with the adoption of the Arizona Constitution in 1913 which is the basis of -- which was the original statement of the apportionment arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.015" offset="995453">The lower house, the House of Representatives is a portion with a basis of a voter registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.423" offset="1021053">The upper house, the State Senate was then apportioned on the basis of county representation, two members from each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.777" offset="1050520">Now, this suit was failed by Gary Peter Klahr, then a third year law student, in April 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.568" offset="1077687">The law at that time seems quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.483" offset="1089285">This Court had seem to -- made it simple and flat and direct statement, “there should be one man, one vote.”</text>
            <text syncTime="254.301" offset="1120528">Nevertheless, the Court did not act on the complaint and did not hold hearings on it until about a-year-and-a-half, more than a-year-and-a-half later.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.455" offset="1173191">It was waiting patiently, the legislation to the job for the reason that I’m sure the Attorney General is going to say here today that the legislative should be given an opportunity to do to remedy the wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.530" offset="1225540">Now, legislature more than a year after the suit was filed, enacted something called Senate Bill 11 which provided for a terribly malapportioned State Senate and it didn’t deal whatever with terribly malapportioned House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.942" offset="1303176">The -- after a hearing on that Bill, the Court by its decree and it was first decree issued in this case, the decree of February 22, 1966, held that the constitutional arrangement of both houses was unconstitution -- that is the Arizona Constitution arrangement was unconstitutional under U.S. Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.813" offset="1394604">And also that Senate Bill 11 was unconstitutional and went on to impose a Court plan what it in its decree called a temporary plan, temporary provisional plan, that was based on voter registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.817" offset="1474644">At least, it was based on voter registration in the urban areas of Phoenix and Tucson and outside of the counties including Phoenix and Tucson, the rural counties, a portion was based on county, 1966 counties, census of following respecting county lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.983" offset="1555310">Now, the malapportionment resulting from the use of this system, that is to say voter registration in the cities and respecting county lines in rural areas was gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.540" offset="1613511">They were -- the deviation was plus 16% to cent I believe to minus 6% and that’s just in the county areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.231" offset="1644335">There’s no way of computing how gross much more gross the malapportionment was under that plan in the urban areas where voter registration was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.275" offset="1676518">Nonetheless, this temporary provisional plan, so-called was used in 1966 and again in 1968, the legislature still having failed to act in a valid way.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.349" offset="1736808">The legislator did enact, try its hand then again in 1967 and it was declared unconstitutional and then it came back in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.964" offset="1787277">Now, the arguments, physical arguments on part of the respondent is not that the plan is in effect, the new temporary provisional plan, not that it’s constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.065" offset="1847672">It’s grossly malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.031" offset="1859480">It’s a gross case of malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.168" offset="1868048">The argument is that well the Court ordered that this plan be used in the elections of the November 1970, and therefore, it loses its affect, loses its sting after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.406" offset="1933040">And the reason that we came here to complain was the history does not show that the malapportionment plan loses its sting the day after the election and that it goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.939" offset="1983091">The decree of February 22, 1966, set up a plan which was used not only in ‘66 but in ‘68 and why isn’t something done.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.118" offset="2023842">The fact is the Court can insist on sitting back and waiting for the legislature to act which is very nice and they should give them a reasonable a chance, but seven years is a far too long.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.858" offset="4106846">And they’ll go kicking and screaming before they change it and that’s particularly true when you have legislatures we now have with a control by the majority party from these people that are from Northeast Phoenix, where they have 27,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.313" offset="4176645">And when they start reapportioning, half of them have to go or a good number of them have to go.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.488" offset="5137324">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.681" offset="5150072">I would like to briefly review for the Court some of the history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.296" offset="5172537">As Mr. Shea properly stated, it was filed in April 1964 at -- no action was taken in the legislature because at that time this legislature was in adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.379" offset="5220916">It said we’ll not meet again until 1965 and at that time, it made some passing attempts at legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.007" offset="5267414">Then, in a special session,in October 1965, it passed that -- one house passed a Bill, the Senate passed a Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.751" offset="5314330">That was then before the Court in the hearings we had in November of 1965, and lest there be a feeling that the present majority was the majority then, the Senate was elected in 1964, had two republicans and 26 democrats, had 35 republicans and 45 democrats in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.088" offset="5407744">That was under the old Senate before reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.244" offset="5424358">In 1965 we had a three-day hearing before then Circuit Judge Pope, the judge Welsh and I can’t recall other justices –judge was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.616" offset="5497814">Then in February 1966, the decree was issued and the parties were told to agree on the two populous counties for the division of Maricopa and Pima County, an agreement was is in effect reached and the Court changed a few precincts and the agreement was reached between the major in effect the parties, I mean the political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.954" offset="5607215">At that time, the plaintiff intervener was not in the action, it was between Mr. Klahr and the Governor, that time there was a democratic governor and the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.582" offset="5649742">The hearing, the decree was established the fact that we had 30 districts in the states and each senatorial district had two House Members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.825" offset="5710660">The counties were kept together as units except in the two major counties and there they were subdivided by a formula that the Court approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.069" offset="5755695">That the Court in effect suggested and that was bringing the 1960 census figures up to date by ratio of the voter registration in the county to the precinct involved because in Arizona, the rapid growth patterns, if we use census tracks which if you've ever read the census tracks, they say up to a telephone poll in effect over a creek and down to an old minings --there’s no legal descriptions in the sense that we use in any other legal works and avoiding the census tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.165" offset="5920057">So we used precincts in the 1966 division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.721" offset="5942209">In the election of 1966 in the Senate, there were 16 republicans elected and 14 democrats, 33 republicans in the House and 27 democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.817" offset="5990588">For the first time in history, Republican Party had a majority in ether House or both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.876" offset="6022875">So I say that to you for this one reason that the present leadership of the House in Senate are the beneficiaries of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.931" offset="6055058">If it was not for reapportionment, they would still be in the minority, and not only do they act in good faith in an attempt to reapportion, it is to their own enlightened self-interest because they would not be there without reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.853" offset="6126738">In 1967, there was a special session in which another attempt was made to have a legislated enacted reapportionment to replace the court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.926" offset="6187029">That special session was in the Spring of -- in May of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.387" offset="6212942">At that time, the matter was referred to the people and our Constitution says that 5% of the voters may refer to the people any Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.311" offset="6248573">No Bill becomes a law for 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.818" offset="6258604">So prior to its effective date, this was referred to the people by 5% of the electorate which meant it went to the ballot in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.749" offset="6302386">The people approved it in 1968, and we had a hearing in January of 1969 in which the Court struck down House Bill 1 it was called, because it did not follow -- it did use registration figures only because in the meantime, the Kirkpatrick and the Rockefeller case had come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.170" offset="6404054">At the time of the first decree in 1966, the Court was laboring under the thought as Mr. Frank reminded them in our hearing last Spring of a so-called Seller Amendment which was then pending in the Congress that we could have a 15% variation in figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.013" offset="6491408">That as -- following this Court’s decision in Kirkpatrick no longer of course is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.389" offset="6528920">In the hearing we had in last April on the present plan in which they were elected, the plaintiff intervener's witness, a Mr. Cohen Pelt (ph) who were testified before the ad hoc House and Senate Committee, testified that the Senate -- that the census tracks would not be available until August of 1971, that is on page 168 of the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.306" offset="8464593">The first one is critically important and that is the availability of the figures because that has so much to do with the timing and say that we now have the population 70 -- population figures by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.365" offset="8520808">Well, that is to say that the 1970 population figures by county is published in a little pamphlet that you buy for 35 cents, it doesn’t mean it's the only figures available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.513" offset="8573471">It said that this summer, and possibly in June the other figures, the more complete figures which we all agree are necessary, the census track figures are available in tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.641" offset="8613909">Well, you can call this number here of the U.S Census Bureau in Washington, D.C and they’ll say well, we don’t have them on tapes and we don’t have them on a brochure that costs 35 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.786" offset="8662497">But, they are there, you see, they are there if anybody has the will to find them, to dig them out to do these things.</text>
