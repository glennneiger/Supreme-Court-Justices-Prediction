            <text syncTime="39.914" offset="264004">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.537" offset="266512">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.637" offset="274975">These cases are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.224" offset="293261">The issue is similar to that involved in the preceding case, but different in a very fundamental respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.244" offset="313323">The -- each of these three criminal convictions were tried after the date of this Court's decision in Duncan versus Louisiana, and under the holding of DeStefano against Woods, therefore, the cases that I am now about to argue are governed by the Duncan rule by which this Court held that Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury by virtue of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is applicable to the state criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.249" offset="413424">As a result of that holding, the primary question before the Court in these cases is whether the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution secures unanimity in jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.588" offset="470789">The petitioners in each of the -- each of the three petitioners in these cases were convicted of a serious crime by less than a unanimous jury in the State of Oregon in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article I, Section 11 of the Oregon Constitution which permits a jury to render a verdict of guilty other than murder in the first degree by 10 out of 12 votes with 2 jurors in disagreement before the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.779" offset="575488">In the Madden case, the charge was grand larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.814" offset="587609">The record shows the jury was out less than 30 minutes and rendered a verdict of guilty by 11-1 and Madden was sentenced to 3 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.394" offset="618015">In the Apodaca case, the charge was assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.094" offset="636824">The jury was out for 41 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.276" offset="645496">They rendered a verdict of guilty by a vote of 11-1, and Apodaca was sentenced to 5 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.133" offset="664931">In the Cooper case, the charge was burglary in a dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.576" offset="678724">The jury was out for 51 minutes and rendered a verdict by a vote of 10-2, and Cooper was sentenced to three-and-half years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.255" offset="709444">Each of the cases was appealed to the Court of Appeals of Oregon which followed the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Oregon which, by a 4-3 vote in state began, held that interpreting Duncan that the rule of unanimity, Historic Rule of Unanimity, was not incorporated by the Sixth Amendment and was not applicable to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.792" offset="783527">The Supreme Court of Oregon denied review in these cases and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.801" offset="807560">In Williams against Florida, decided last term, this Court held that only those common law requisites of trial by jury that are fundamental in their purpose that are essential to the functioning of a jury as an institution secured by the Sixth Amendment, and the mere fact that a procedure was part of the jury requisites, a common law does not itself satisfy the standard for inclusion in the Sixth Amendment unless there is a showing that that procedure is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.077" offset="928664">Our argument here is plainly within the holding of Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.073" offset="940680">We think that there was, as the Court said in Williams, there was no showing that the number 12 could be shown to have served any special or significant function.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.664" offset="975057">We think there are several reasons, why the requirement of unanimity serves important functions for the jury, and it's on this basis, we ask the Court, applying to Williams holding to hold that the right of unanimity was incorporated by the Sixth Amendment and is therefore, applicable to the trial of these petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.873" offset="1175886">That's what this Court said and that the issue, therefore, for the Court to decide in each instance is the fundamental nature of the requisite in issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="282.523" offset="1234505">Mr. Justice White said for the Court in Williams that, in each case in which there is a question of whether a jury requisite is incorporated in the Sixth Amendment, as part of the Sixth Amendment guarantee, it will look to the historic purposes of the jury, the functioning of the jury, and determine and interpreting the word “jury” in the Sixth Amendment which is what -- the text we looked to, what that word “jury” means.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.499" offset="1318410">It certainly means something, and we think that there are some of the common law requisites that are incorporated by the use of the word “jury” in the Sixth Amendment and as the Court held in Williams, some are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.652" offset="1358952">And, the test in interpreting the word “jury” in the Sixth Amendment which is the source, that the test is the fundamental nature of the essential purposes of the requisite in issue in terms of jury trial.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="324.156" stopTime="337.239">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="324.156" offset="1401062">How does Mr. Madison's unsuccessful effort to have the unanimous verdict enter into the scales, if it enters in?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="337.239" offset="1453307">In answer to that question, Mr. Chief Justice, I would just take the holding of the Court in Williams that the history of an effort to make the Sixth Amendment more specific by including the word “unanimity” in the Sixth Amendment can be read either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.195" offset="1513179">It can be read to be interpreted, as Mr. Justice Holland said in his concurring opinion in Williams, that it was so much assumed that the requirement of unanimity and 12 men in that case was incorporated by the use of the word “jury,” there was no necessity for particularization.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.500" offset="1582352">It could also be argued that that was not assumed, that an effort was made, and that the effort failed and that has significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.448" offset="1614221">This Court's interpretation in Williams of that history said the question is open, that we cannot -- there is not enough guidance either way from the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.268" offset="1653509">Examining that very process of Mr. Madison's proposed amendment, it's consideration, it's passage on one side, it's defeat on the other, and it's ultimate defeat, this Court considering that history said the question is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.651" offset="1703037">Now, we look to fundamentalness.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.487" offset="1710352">I approach this case exactly within the test which was framed by the Court in Williams, and I would like to argue to the Court that in at least three respects, three very important respects, the requirement of unanimity serves that fundamental function that the Court was talking about in Williams when it said we are going to only incorporate those that serve a fundamental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.184" offset="1789137">And the functions that we think it does serve that are fundamental is its effect on the process of deliberation, its effect on the government's burden of proof, and its effect on the constitutional requirements, that a cross-section of the community participate in jury decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.647" offset="1854966">I'd like to briefly take those up -- each one up without repeating unnecessarily on the argument in the case that preceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.887" offset="1891955">The Court -- this Court in Allen against United States, in 1896, said the very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views and by arguments among the jurors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.534" offset="1938557">The process of group deliberation by jury tests the juror's understanding of the evidence, requires dissenting and majority views in order to reach a verdict come out of the jury room, requires them to put their impressions of the evidence to a test, and has historically been recognized as a very important safeguard in weeding out erroneous or misunderstandings of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.733" offset="2031344">The requirement of unanimity, wherever there is any dissenter in the jury room, requires that the jury discuss the case and come out with some kind of consensus upon full discussion and consideration of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.018" offset="2084425">Now, the majority verdict rule undercuts deliberation in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.617" offset="2102815">When the first vote of the jury shows that there is the requisite majority for a verdict, regardless of whether there any dissenters, there is no deliberation at all and the jury comes back to the Court room and renders its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.202" offset="2149209">In a case of that kind, even though one or two jurors in the Oregon procedure or one, two, or three jurors in the Louisiana procedure have objections to the finding of guilt feel that there is doubt about the evidence, there is no opportunity whatsoever for them to so much as express their views and have the possibility of them convincing the majority of the correctness of their views, there's no deliberation whatsoever.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="532.415" stopTime="539.143">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="532.415" offset="2234055">Are you positive of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="534.456" offset="2242205">Do we know that a jury doesn't deliberate before it votes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_b_sobol" startTime="539.143" stopTime="591.512">
            <label>Mr. Robert B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="539.143" offset="2261013">Well, we don't know about any particular jury whether it does or it does not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.969" offset="2280239">But, the time that the juries in these cases were out for example, which in all cases was less than an hour and in one case was less than half an hour, is very strong indication of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.344" offset="2317751">More important indication of that is the fact that, again going back to Kalven &amp; Zeisel, which seems to be the text in terms of jury functioning that in the State of Oregon and the State of Louisiana, 25% of jury verdicts are split verdicts, whereas, across the country, only 5% of the juries hang.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.597" offset="2390789">So, if those facts, if that survey is accurate, it would indicate that in many, many cases, five times as often as a jury would hang, the deliberative process is short-circuited by the fact that the -- a certain number of jurors are entitled to render a verdict under the constitutional procedure at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.542" offset="3254606">On the deliberation point, I think it's important to note that, quantitatively, the most important function of this majority verdict rule is not to avoid hung juries, but to short-circuit the process of deliberation because as I've indicated, 25% of the criminal trials in these jurisdictions result in split verdicts in situations where the nationwide evidence is very strong that a consensus would be reached, an unanimous jury verdict would be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.455" offset="3354185">So a very important function, a very important product, not functions in the sense it's intended, but a very important product of the rules of allowing majority verdicts is that the historic deliberative process of the jury is short-circuited.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.371" offset="3405908">In going back to Williams, I would suggest the process of the jury deliberating together, exchanging views, considering the views of everybody in the jury room is one of the fundamental requisites of the jury system which we -- I would argue, under Williams, is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.810" offset="3463586">Now, Oregon makes a peculiar kind of answer to this assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.354" offset="3481767">It points to the English statute which was adopted in 1967 which establishes a minimum period of deliberation before the jury verdict by a 10-1 or 11-1 vote can be received and says, “well, there are other ways of doing it” and, my answer to that is perhaps there are other ways of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.561" offset="3550626">Perhaps, unanimity is not the only way of assuring deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.198" offset="3565150">I happen to think it's the best, but the important point for this is the Court hasn't got that before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.752" offset="3743410">Yes, sir, and that's the point I'm about to get to as the second essential fundamental purpose of trial by a unanimous jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.855" offset="3783847">We think the requirement of the unanimity is closely related to the requirement of burden -- to the burden of proof imposed on the government in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.583" offset="3822717">In Winship, this Court articulated it as a constitutional matter that that burden of proof was guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond the particular articulation, it has always been clear that there is a very high burden of proof on the government in criminal cases and that burden of proof in practice means, and has always meant, one thing, and that is convincing everybody in the jury room of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.882" offset="3911952">It's perfectly clear, as the preceding argument seem to acknowledge, that where less jurors than 12 can convict or less jurors than all can convict, it is easier to convict, less evidence is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.496" offset="3966391">Now, I don't think the question -- to give my response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think the question in a due process in a criminal procedure case before this Court is simply whether convictions are harder or easier, obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.356" offset="4021770">I think the question is much more complicated than that, but in this case there are two points that distinguish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.645" offset="4042982">One is that you have an historic system for the functioning of the reasonable doubt standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.231" offset="4061372">Reasonable doubt means you convince everybody in the jury room of something.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.350" offset="4077777">When you tinker with that standard, when you say two-thirds will do or three-quarters will do or five or six will do, you are lowering the government's burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.709" offset="4111214">You are altering whatever “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” has always meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.862" offset="4123857">It's being altered in these cases and less proof will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.058" offset="4140680">Now, the second thing which I think, which I think is a very important aspect of this, is that this is not a case where we're saying a particular procedural rule will alter the rate of convictions in the sense of their exclusion of confessions or exclusion of illegally seized evidence where the countervailing factor is not the correctness of the fact-finding but police conduct or administrative conduct where other factors are being weighed against the probable outcome of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.919" offset="4252066">Here, the alteration before the Court affects the integrity of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.496" offset="4270352">As the opinions of a Court in Winship recognized, whenever there is an ex post facto determination of facts, whenever some later body is determining what happened, there's always a chance of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.104" offset="4312775">The tradition of this country is that chance of error is reduced to what is considered an acceptable point by requiring every juror to concur in the determination of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.858" offset="6103834">That's true, Mr. Justice White, but I think that there is less certainty about the finding of guilt which this Court in Winship and in numerous cases, it has indicated as a prime function of the requisites of the procedure in criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.337" offset="6165692">I'd like to briefly touch on our last points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.153" offset="6181052">We think, although I don't have time to explore the point at length, that the requirement of unanimity has an important relationship with the jury cases in this Court having to do with a cross-section of the community participating in the jury decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.921" offset="6236118">I think that there is something ironic about almost 100 years of case after case in this Court concerning the panel from which the jury must be drawn, leading to the possibility that the newly included persons, the cross-section people first included on juries, minorities particularly now can be ousted from participation in the verdict by a rule which allows a 9-3 or 10-2 vote and could conceivably be a 9-3 vote against the vote, the voice of the very people that 100 years of decisions of this Court have secured the right to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.680" offset="6371119">I think the right to participate, at the very least, means the right to participate in the process of deliberation of the jury and the rendition of a verdict, not simply to sit in a jury box and go in and watch your vote which is -- could possibly go against them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="1692.698" offset="6875178">Well, I think when we're talking about altering a time-honored constitutional procedure which goes back in the decisions of this Court to almost 100 years in terms of unanimity in jury process which is integrally related to the burden of proof, when a change in that is proposed, a radical change in that is proposed in terms of the functioning of the jury trial, the chances of that change in procedure, weakening protections is a very important consideration because the Court can never be sure of a thing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.535" offset="6998580">All it can look at is what the prospects are that this alteration of procedure will have that impact, will have the impact on offsetting a guaranteed right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.280" offset="7037555">In this moment, I'm referring to the cross-section right, but I think that also goes to the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.750" offset="7055423">I can't argue to this Court that there is not reasonable doubt in one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.908" offset="7072037">All I'm saying is that the standard of its determination has been lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.997" offset="7092412">Lastly, I would like to just touch for a moment on the practicalities here that unlike the case in Williams where many states had juries fewer than 12, here there were only two states that have non-majority -- that have non-unanimous rules except for a very small handful of cases punishable by less than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.649" offset="7167018">There are only two states that are substantially involved in this decision, Oregon and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.485" offset="7182378">Secondly, a transfer from the system that prevails in this state to the historic constitutional rule is a very simple matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.929" offset="7208082">It doesn't require calling more jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.816" offset="7215710">It doesn't require much at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.960" offset="7224278">It simply requires the judge to instruct the jury as judges in 48 states in the federal system instruct the jury that they have to bring in the determination by a unanimous vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.119" offset="7264820">And, while there will be substantially more deliberation as a result of the unanimity rule, an important point we think in our favor, the increase in hung juries as a result of this was only 2 or 3%, but we think that's a very important 2 or 3% because those are cases in which there was substantial and prolonged doubt, and that doubt should lead to either a retrial or at least not a finding of guilt in those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.595" offset="7434825">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.340" offset="7449767">I will not repeat Mrs. Korns' history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.842" offset="7459798">I found it accurate and detailed in the brief, and Mr. Sobol has stated this case fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.245" offset="7485398">I would like to say at the outset that I am defending the non-unanimous jury verdict system not only because we have three cases, three convictions, at Bar and several others stacked up as certiorari -- petitions for certiorari pending, but because it is a good system and it works and it is to be defended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.185" offset="7581111">As Mr. Justice Stewart indicated in his questioning, it is a two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.167" offset="7601068">It is not simply another darling of the prosecutor's nursery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.942" offset="7620190">People are acquitted in the same manner that people are convicted by 10-2 verdicts in situations which, in another state, would result in a hung verdict -- a hung jury and a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.140" offset="7668987">And, to take just a moment with Mr. Kalven &amp; Zeisel, before moving on, I do want to dispute one thing and these also were asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.426" offset="7710051">In regard to the ultimate deadlock statistics that they set out, out of the cases they have studied, they show 42 cases deadlocked at 10-2. 34 of them, that's 1%, were deadlocked with convicting majorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.607" offset="7770864">19% were convicted -- were deadlocked with acquitting majorities and in -- where I come from, in Multnomah County, the conviction rate is 85%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.306" offset="7817571">That figure where those cases allowed to go to 10-2 verdicts would have been favorable to the defendant, not to the state, by an insignificant percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.032" offset="7856546">And, in cases of initial voting, they sampled 156 cases and of those, none, which began at 11-1, were hung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.624" offset="7898864">Those which went with initial votes of 2 or 3 to convict were hung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.253" offset="7933450">There were 7% of those hung, and the reverse situation there were none hung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.117" offset="7952886">So, again, those are juries likely to convict -- pardon me, likely to acquit where 7% were hung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.437" offset="7990188">So, even on that statistic, this system -- it would seem, according to those figures, are favorable to the defendant and not to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.579" offset="8022685">I'm here to defend it because Oregon believes it to be a good system and the American Law Institute agreed with that in 1931 when it recommended it and substantially the form which Oregon adopted, as well as an Oregon Commission which had many distinguished members including the Senator to be, Wayne Morse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.392" offset="8105963">The English adopted the same system, somewhat modified, requiring a minimum deliberation time in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.044" offset="8144624">The American Bar Association project on minimum standards of criminal justice have approved -- that's the wrong word, endorsed the system for us in the American states and a very extinguished panel both on the groups which drafted the report and the general project committee headed by Judge Lombard which approved it in 1968, and I'm speaking, therefore, of the approved draft and not the tentative draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.792" offset="8263534">In Oregon, as sort of a lab model in the federal system, has shown that it works and the experience in Oregon has been that it seems to sort the innocent from the guilty and it does it in a way which is fair and which is accurate and which is expeditious and that's what the criminal justice system is suppose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.438" offset="8342110">There is no cry of injustice which I am aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.150" offset="8352977">There are theoretical objections raised, such as Mr. Sobol's, but no one has claimed injustice, most certainly no more so than in states which require unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.112" offset="8400833">Kalven and Zeisel, in an article -- in a subsequent article which they wrote as sort of an advisory article to the British who were considering the Criminal Justice Act of 1967, recommended against adoption of that Act, but they also acknowledged that the Oregon system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.685" offset="8463109">It achieves justice fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.533" offset="8470528">There's no breakdown of justice in Oregon, and there is no breakdown and no cry of injustice in these cases either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.405" offset="8501979">Two of the defendants in the cases before the Court took the stand and admitted guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.148" offset="8524967">One admitted complicity, the other one admitted guilt and asked for sympathy and, in the third case, he was convicted on the basis of a voluntary confession and he did not present a case or, in any way, deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.505" offset="8574391">They were out, granted, for periods of under an hour, but no jury faced with those facts could or should have acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.575" offset="8602708">Those would've been miscarriages of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.767" offset="8619426">I do want to briefly mention history which has already been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.068" offset="8636667">The senate did delete the unanimity requirement of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.350" offset="8653803">The House failed to restore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.462" offset="8662267">The reason is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.418" offset="8674074">It is not as Mr. Sobol suggests that it was not necessary to detail the procedure because that was understood as a part of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.548" offset="8726632">Rather, we get the history from Madison's letter at the time, which is referred to in Williams versus Florida and which I refer to in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.126" offset="8760905">We get the similar history of Article III, Section 2 from the Federalist No. 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.022" offset="8792461">The reason it was not included was because the practice of the states at the time was diverse, and therefore, there was not the inclination to lock all the states into one uniform system and, as the Chief Justice has pointed out, 4 -- at least 4 of, which I'm aware, of the colonies, North Carolina may have changed by then, did practice non-unanimous systems and that's 4 out of 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.697" offset="8899145">New York had a strange system which the Federalist refers to, where there was an appeal as a matter of right from one jury to another until somebody had 2 out of 3 verdicts, which is essentially a 24 out of 36 vote, two-thirds vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.209" offset="8961212">So, the practice was not uniform and that is the reason it was not locked in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.355" offset="8981797">Counsel suggests, I think incorrectly, that this Court write into the Sixth Amendment what the Senate or the framers took out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.010" offset="9016487">The federal unanimity, incidentally, is statutory, at least in my view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.896" offset="9039997">I point out in my brief at page 19 that the effort at the convention to insert in Article III, Section 2 the language “and a trial by jury shall be preserved as usual in criminal cases” was defeated and the constitutional conventions of Eliot's debates shows it and, again, the argument was there's no such thing as “as usual” at this point of history in the American colonies.</text>
