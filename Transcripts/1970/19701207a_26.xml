            <text syncTime="38.318" offset="256606">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.246" offset="268309">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.671" offset="282102">It involves the criminal conviction of Father James E. Groppi from resisting arrest during a civil rights demonstration that took place in August of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.107" offset="323793">At issue is the constitutionality of the Wisconsin statute which prohibited the change of venue in Father Groppi's case because he was charged with a misdemeanor rather than a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.953" offset="371231">The facts of the case briefly state are as follows: Father Groppi, a Roman Catholic priest, advisor to the NAACP Youth Council and an active civil rights leader for number of years in Milwaukee was arrested on August 31, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.948" offset="443120">He was charged with resisting arrest, a misdemeanor punishable under Wisconsin law by a maximum of one year and a $500.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.724" offset="482304">He was convicted after a jury trial on February 9, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.980" offset="507277">The testimony at trial just laid out in some detail in our brief, is significant in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.859" offset="534758">First, it is clear that the activities out of which his criminal charge arose were considered crimes of major precautions by the people of Milwaukee, whatever the technical classification of the crime with which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.145" offset="591914">Thus, the defendant's arrest occurred in the course of a civil rights march, protesting a proclamation issued by the Mayor of Milwaukee, banning all marches and demonstrations from 4 p.m. to 9 a.m. for a 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.158" offset="648025">That proclamation had itself been issued in response to a series of civil rights demonstrations, marches and activities participated in by Father Groppi and the Youth Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.838" offset="694732">The testimony is also significant in that the States and the defenses' versions of the facts essential to his guilt or innocence on the resisting arrest charge were in basic conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.342" offset="744782">The state witnesses testified that while Father Groppi was being carried in a limp position to the police wagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.878" offset="774875">He kicked the policeman who was carrying him by the left leg, meanwhile shouting a profanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.727" offset="798281">Defense witnesses testified that that same officer had gouged Father Groppi's leg and then it was in response to that that Father Groppi demanded his name and badge number.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.486" offset="841331">The defense denied that there've been any kicking or any profanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.905" offset="862960">The defendant moved prior to trial for change of venue on the grounds that massive and prejudicial news coverage that he had received as a civil rights leader and in connection with this case in Milwaukee County had created community prejudice preventing an impartial jury trial in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.477" offset="933282">He asked for an opportunity to prove the nature in extent of that news coverage and its effect on the community and then the likelihood of an impartial trial in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.957" offset="979153">This motion was denied for that in evidentiary hearing on the sole ground that the Wisconsin statute at issue prohibited a change of venue in misdemeanor cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.497" offset="1105377">The Trial Court interpreted that very specifically to prohibit change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.922" offset="1123035">It was on that ground such denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.276" offset="1132440">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin in its opinion again interprets that statute to absolutely prohibit change of venue in a misdemeanor case.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.035" offset="1183535">It says only that in a felony case of change of venue may be allowed but the Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion specifically says both that the motion was denied on the ground that the statute provided for change of venue only in felony matters, that's 208 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.680" offset="1270053">And then if the Supreme Court itself said, the applicable statute specifies that a change of venue based on community prejudice shall only be permitted in felony cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.214" offset="1852270">In fact that a specific misdemeanor court did not exist, it seems to me wouldn't be at bar to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.432" offset="2713057">The reason that voir dire, when the State makes the argument that the defendant had an opportunity to show community prejudice in this case either on voir dire or on a motion for continuance or in a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.752" offset="2786408">And it's the failure to do this that deprives them of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.098" offset="2799783">Our answer to that is that whereas claim constitutional is claim, is that the circumstances are such that only a change of venue can protect his right to an impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.020" offset="2843460">There is no reason that he should be required to pursue remedies which he considers inadequate in order to get a record of community prejudice into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.167" offset="2892048">And we contend this is so particularly because pursuit of those remedies might involve waiver of vital constitutional rights and might be fruitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.019" offset="2927470">In particular, both continuance and voir dire, continuance under Wisconsin law had the defendant move for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.214" offset="2956204">He would have waived his right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.549" offset="2965608">Secondly, the kind of proof he might have been able to get in a motion for a continuance, would have been that he would indeed have been able to get a fair trial in Wisconsin eventually and it's not a very thing that he is claiming he could not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.097" offset="3019734">As far as voir dire is concerned, he is allowed under Wisconsin law to ask questions of particular jurors or presumably is with respect to whether or not they heard particular information of same things but he would not be allowed to bring in outside witnesses to show that the community as a whole was exposed to prejudice which is the kind of evidence to this Court found in Rideau was relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.050" offset="5539610">The other problem, with the introducing this evidence on a motion for a new trial and the other reason that it would be fruitless is that there is no indication, a change of venue would be possible in Wisconsin even such motion will want.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.721" offset="5730304">I think the given of the Wisconsin statute denying change of venue and there would be no possibility of their granting a change of venue and it says Groppi's contention in this case that a simple -- I mean granting a new trial under those circumstances would really be the same as granting a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.423" offset="5797073">That's his contention that that would be an inadequate remedy because of -- in the circumstances, particular case because of his continued civil rights activity because the prejudice really resulted from his notoriety as a person not from the facts of the particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.210" offset="5860185">There is no reason to believe that the prejudice would disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.516" offset="5877426">In any event, our only real contention is that he was entirely at least to unhearing to show that a continuance would not have been inadequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.456" offset="5913161">I just like to point out that the one case which -- or the two cases which have really dealt with the statute like Wisconsin's both held that on the record where the defendant had no opportunity to get community prejudice in at the change of venue motion hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.494" offset="5973347">The fact that there was no community prejudice in the record was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.670" offset="6010023">I'd like to just briefly discuss the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.723" offset="6038235">Our basic argument is the statute is in violation of the defendant's right both under the Due Process and under the Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.029" offset="6075538">We start with the fundamental proposition that a criminal defendant in our system has a right to have his innocence or guilt determined on the evidence by an impartial trier of fact whether the case is a felony or misdemeanor, a serious or petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.769" offset="6130500">Since Wisconsin law provides that the trial of fact in all criminal cases be a jury, it's our contention that the defendant had a federal due process right to all procedures essential to ensure that that jury was impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.034" offset="6187551">The court below and the state contend the change of venue has only one or several methods to insure jury impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.094" offset="6219734">It is our contention that the other methods available to deal with pretrial publicity have inherent limitations and that therefore change of venue may under some circumstances be constitutionally necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.773" offset="6266441">Continuance, as I've said may be ineffective but the publicity may revive and that it conflicts with the defendant's right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.744" offset="6302386">Voir dire may be ineffective for reasons I've also described and for -- also for reasons that this Court in Rideau recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.609" offset="6337808">In Rideau, this Court based its finding that due process required a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.160" offset="6355989">In that case, on the exposure of the community to prejudicial publicity it specifically refused to base its finding on a particularized examination of the transcript of the voir dire proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.520" offset="6421504">If change of venue is required depending on the circumstances by due process, then we contend that it cannot be limited to felony cases, that there is no rational for this distinction because as this case indicates community prejudice may arise from the personality and notoriety of the individual, rather than the particular crime and also from the substance of the activities not just from the technical charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.038" offset="7467551">If the Court please, I would like first of all just to mention briefly a -- what is the difference of opinion about the statement of facts, the respondent did not take issue in its brief with the statement of facts presented in the appellants brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.820" offset="7578624">The misunderstanding arises in this fashion. That the statement of facts in the appellants brief contains considerable detail, factual detail about what happened at the trial, what the testimony of this witness was and that witness was and our disagreement arises and that the respondent takes a position that such facts do not have any relevance whatsoever with respect to the issue which the appellant seeks to raise and seeks to have decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.393" offset="7720939">The ground rules of this Court as I understand them and as expressed by this Court in Mooney versus Holohan and other cases is that, an appellant who seeks reversal of his conviction on the grounds that he has been denied a constitutional right must show that he and not some hypothetical member of a class has been denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.663" offset="7846013">The constitutional right the appellant seeks to have indicated here is the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.436" offset="7893138">That is a jury that is not affected by community prejudice to the point where it cannot judge the issues of fact impartially in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.280" offset="7936502">The constitutional right is sought to be indicated is not change of venue but the right to an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.632" offset="7977880">Now, the appellant says that under certain circumstances and this is following this expression or something similar to it is found four different places in the briefs filed by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.243" offset="8048306">The Court is told that under certain circumstances a change of venue may be constitutionally necessary even in a misdemeanor case to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury and the reason we contend that the appellant repeatedly says under some circumstances, this may be constitutionally necessary is because the appellant recognizes that this Court has not been given a factual record, a factual setting in which against which the constitutional issue can be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.694" offset="8242134">The question that the appellant seeks to raise is certainly an interesting one, it's a tantalizing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.075" offset="8275675">There is not much law previous authority on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.033" offset="8295528">There will apparently be less in the future because of the trend among the States to grant changes of venue in all criminal cases and not to limit the right to change venue to felonies or capital crimes or make such other distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.565" offset="8361671">It's the respondent's position that the Court is being asked to give an advisory opinion and this Court has repeatedly said in the past that it does not seat to give advisory opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.921" offset="14871071">First, with respect to new trial, I just want to make absolutely clear that under the two cases that we had found dealing with the standards from reversal on the grounds that the trial was unfair on a motion after verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.293" offset="14924570">The standard is entirely different from the constitutionally required standard for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.482" offset="14949334">One case is State versus Nutley, says that reversal for an unfair trial can be granted only with the publicity with such that the jurors could not help but predetermine the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.506" offset="14997400">The other case is Zelmer versus State which is not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.881" offset="15014849">It's at 159 northwest 2d 669.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.599" offset="15029791">It's a 1968 Wisconsin Supreme Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.356" offset="15044838">It says that you can reverse only if the Court is convinced that the defendant should not have been found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.396" offset="15068975">I think the constitutional standard that this Court has defined in cases like Rideau, Irvin, Shepherd and a number of others is a standard of potential for prejudice not an extreme likelihood that the defendant would not be found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.451" offset="15137207">Secondly, on the continuance remedy, I think it's clear that in the case like this continuance would be inadequate unless somebody like Father Groppi is simply to stop the kind of civil rights activity in which he was engaged and continues to be engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.658" offset="15198020">Thirdly, in considering the adequacy of the record of community prejudice made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.483" offset="15221321">I think it's important to recognize that this is not an entirely new issue that the Court is being asked to decide that in Rideau, this Court made it very clear the change of venue was a constitutionally required method of guaranteeing theory impartiality in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.823" offset="15302614">All we asked for below and all we're asking for it now is the chance to prove those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.834" offset="15326751">Finally, as the few points with respect to the record of community prejudice in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.431" offset="15353083">That it gets important to recognize that when the defense counsel went before the judge in this case and asked him to take judicial notice of adverse news coverage, it was before that court at that time which had been living for months indeed years with prejudicial publicity about Father Groppi not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.481" offset="15421315">Secondly, I believe it's fairly common for courts to take judicial notice of or to be asked to take judicial notice of adverse news coverage and that if they consider that inadequate, want to see it or want some kind of showing that they can ask for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.376" offset="15492890">Thirdly, on the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3848.878" offset="15498846">On that point, isn't that the conventional way if you are asking the Court to take judicial notice of the whole category at least to suggest by way of proffer, some specific instances as to alert the Court to the area?</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.811" offset="15578572">The defendant did suggest both in his affidavit in the motion and also in those proposed findings of fact which you asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.472" offset="15621308">The kind of television and newspaper coverage and to answer finally specifically that question about the proposed findings of fact that appear, I think it's in record 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.952" offset="15667179">They were rejected in the record at page 9 is the hearing on the motion for a change of venue and the court rejected those charge findings of fact on the same grounds that it rejected that proffer of proof, saying in page 9 that change of venue was asked for and the motion will be denied and not being provided for in the Wisconsin statutes.</text>
