            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in number 204, Crampton against the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.923" offset="255039">Mr. Callahan, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Callahan</label>
            <text syncTime="46.229" offset="288266">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.719" offset="306239">The Crampton case presents a similar challenge to the imposition of the death penalty or cases of murder in the first degree under the Ohio procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.028" offset="355453">Similar to McGautha, the McGautha case in California, we decry the lack of standards to guide a jury in the selection of its penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.061" offset="403623">We have the added feature in Ohio of contending that a procedure which permits a jury to consider and determine the issues of guilt and punishment in a single proceeding violates the defendant’s rights under the Fifth Amendment to be free from self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.594" offset="493798">The statutes involved in the Crampton case are the statute which defines murder in the first degree in Ohio which sets up the felony type murders and the necessity of deliberate or premeditated malice and also prescribes the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.379" offset="560880">The statute says that the punishment is death unless the jury recommends mercy in which event the punishment is imprisonment in the penitentiary for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.014" offset="599437">We are also bringing to the attention of the Court the statute which provides the right of allocution to a defendant in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.545" offset="633501">The factual context of the Crampton situation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.547" offset="653563">James Crampton was a man approximately 40 years of age at the time of this incident, and he had been married to Wilma Crampton approximately four months at the time of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.102" offset="723780">In November of 1966, shortly after the couple were married, Crampton admitted himself voluntarily to a hospital for treatment for drug addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.223" offset="776234">He later was confined under the court order of the Probate Court of Lucas County, Ohio to the Toledo State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.632" offset="813850">Shortly before the holidays of 1966, Crampton was released to his wife Wilma on a trial visit by the State Hospital authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.738" offset="854288">In January of 1967, she remonstrated with him to return to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.786" offset="886471">He refused then he left the family home. He remained away for approximately ten days to two weeks during which time, he was with a friend whom he admit in Pontiac, Michigan and traveled throughout the Ohio, Michigan and Indiana area procuring drugs with money that they obtained from thefts generally in motels.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.210" offset="980198">On January 17, he returned to Toledo, Ohio and came to the residence of his wife at approximately seven o’clock in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.859" offset="1018859">Later the same evening, he was found driving a stolen car in the streets of downtown Toledo with a 45 caliber automatic on the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.293" offset="1052505">His wife’s body was discovered the following morning having been shot through the head with what appeared to be a 45 caliber automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.978" offset="1091271">When he came to the Lucas County Court, he entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to the charge of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.892" offset="1138918">At the trial of his case before a jury, he did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.865" offset="1158875">He supplied in order to support his plea of not guilty by a reason of insanity, the medical records from the hospitals that he had been in both before and after his arrest, and also his mother testified on his behalf with reference to his background.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.541" offset="1225540">The jury had to decide at a single seat whether or not the defendant was guilty or innocent, whether or not he was insane at the time of the crime or possess its faculties at the time of the crime and whether his punishment should be life imprisonment or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.484" offset="1309341">The instruction given to the jury and we have no quarrel with the instructions with reference to the guilt or the insanity issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.764" offset="1350405">The instruction given to the jury on the question of punishment was, if you find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, this appears at page 5 five of the petitioner’s brief, the punishment is death unless you recommend mercy in which event the punishment is imprisonment during the penitentiary for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.580" offset="1429713">The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree did not recommend mercy and the defendant came before the court and was sentenced to death by electrocution in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.723" offset="1482271">His appeal to the Ohio courts, the judgment of the lower courts have been upheld and this court has granted certiorari on the question of the standards question and what has been alluded to as the single verdict question.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.844" offset="1538800">In view of the fact that the standards question has been treated in depth to this point, I will address myself first to the question of Fifth Amendment problem as it arises in the Crampton case.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.852" offset="1626781">No Mr. Chief Justice, the -- once the jury in Ohio imposes the penalty of death it cannot be modified or affected by the trial court or by any appellate court unless there is a legal error found in the record with reference to the conviction and if the conviction falls of course the punishment falls with it but the sentence of death in and of itself imposed by the jury is absolutely immune at all stages in the trial and appellate procedure in Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.005" offset="1755408">Do you consider that an important -- further important distinction from the McGautha case?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Callahan</label>
            <text syncTime="418.387" offset="1776933">I do indeed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.739" offset="1794278">The petitioner Crampton contends that he has under the Federal Constitution, two rights involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.017" offset="1843388">One is the right not to incriminate himself under the Fifth Amendment, and the second is the right if he is found guilty of the charge made against him to have his sentence be imposed on a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.324" offset="1904619">We contend that this is a due process right and that this latter right includes the right to a hearing on the question of life or death and the right to address evidence to the question of his punishment, address evidence to his sentence under the Ohio unitary trial procedure however, there is a dilemma confronting the defendant in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.682" offset="2014124">If he invokes his Fifth Amendment right, the jury decides his punishment without ever hearing from the man whose life they hold in their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.063" offset="2059577">If he waives his Fifth Amendment right, he will take the stand and subjects himself not only to the possibility of incriminating himself but also he had subject to impeachment as to his credibility and in Ohio this covers a great range of inquiry not only prior convictions for felonies and statutory misdemeanors in the civilian courts and in the military courts, he can be queried about his dishonorable discharge from service, any changes in employment and indication in a recent cases that he can be subject to impeachment by questioning about pending indictments, not convictions but only pending indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.203" offset="2236165">The only limitation placed upon the subject by the courts of Ohio is that his limitation is within the discretion of the trial court and if the trial court does not abuse this discretion and it clearly shows by the record that there is an abusive discretion, there is no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.675" offset="2306069">So to avoid this --</text>

            <text syncTime="564.583" offset="2361657">Under the Ashbrook case in Ohio, Mr. Justice Marshall, it would appear that the question of punishment is not an issue and no evidence can be addressed by the defendant to the question of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.933" offset="2419127">He must only go and present evidence on the question of his guilt or his responsibility for the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.802" offset="2490598">Now, I will admit that in many cases in Ohio and I think this is in one of the opinions written by the Honorable Chief Justice at an earlier time indicated that in many cases a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is entered and many mitigating factors directed toward the sentencing come in, in an indirect fashion under the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.272" offset="2592475">Did it put in evidence beyond the issue of guilt, evidence that goes on and the issue of punishment?</text>

            <text syncTime="631.195" offset="2628106">Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe that it would be difficult to distinguish whether the state’s evidence is directed to the issue of guilt or punishment because the aggravating factors that would be necessarily involved in a proving the crime itself would also be directed toward the punishment phase of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.130" offset="2839907">Is it not as practical matter possible for a defendant in any capital case to put the whole range of his right in evidence by use of psychiatric and other expert testimony as to his background, his boyhood, his habits, his narcotic addition if any, the whole range of his behavior pattern, and his lifestyle?</text>

            <text syncTime="722.703" offset="2994134">That’s correct, but there is incriminating evidence that comes in with this psychiatric testimony or testimony of the psychiatric type.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.652" offset="3026004">In the course of entering these hospitals, a full and complete record is taken with respect to his case history.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.675" offset="3050036">If he has been involved in prior criminal incidents, they are appearing not only in the admission’s report, in the psychologist report and many times in the findings by the psychiatrist and he is when he submits the evidence of his background through medical records off times incriminating himself vicariously through what he has said to the psychiatrist at an earlier occasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.710" offset="3186186">It would be difficult however to try a case in front of the jury and attempt to block part of the medical records from a technical standpoint to deprive the jury of some part of the medical record when you are submitting the others for their examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.318" offset="3248671">So there is a certain compulsion to submit to the jury the entire medical record and when there is this evidence in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.763" offset="3290467">When the defendant Crampton was confronted with the dilemma in the present case, he elected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right and he thereby surrendered his right to address the jury who is in effect the sentencer in this case on the right of his punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.123" offset="3359848">Now the statute in Ohio, with reference to allocution is a mandatory statute so held by our Supreme Court and we go through the ritual in Ohio of bringing the defendant before the court in a capital case after he has been found guilty without a recommendation of mercy by the jury and asking him if he has anything to say as to why sentence should not be imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.665" offset="3462040">The court is not the sentencer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.905" offset="3474996">It merely imposing the verdict on the basis of the mandatory allocution statute he has asked this but the statute is meaningless totally meaningless in the cases of murder in the first degree but even -- where a death penalty has been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.870" offset="3530898">Now, if you can conceive of a situation wherein the judge asks the question, “Do you have anything to say why judgment should not be imposed against you” and a reason where to be advanced by the defendant in this hypothetical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.735" offset="3598294">There is a serious question as to whether the judge, the trial judge could modify or in any way reach the sentence that has been imposed by the jury to amend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.075" offset="3647718">It’s totally insulated under the laws of Ohio once the jury has made this decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.765" offset="8794467">The petitioner’s basic decision in regard to the question of bifurcation of trials and capital cases consist of three matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.051" offset="8843577">His first position is that there is a collision of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.914" offset="8866983">In this particular case, he claims his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his alleged Fourteenth Amendment right to allocution are colliding, and that one impermissibly burdens the exercise of his privilege not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.230" offset="8956322">His reliance in that regard on the cases of U.S. versus Jackson, Simmons and cases were two specific constitutional rights were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.810" offset="9018598">It is further the amici claim that we have a question of fundamental fairness under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.515" offset="9065409">It is the position of the State of Ohio that there is no collision of constitutional right in that number one, allocution has never risen to a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.876" offset="9142836">Secondly, that there is no burden or penalty on the exercise of his right against self-incrimination because allocution evidence can be admitted by other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.583" offset="9221726">Secondly, the petitioner had a choice to do what he considered would benefit him the most when he made his decision not to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.801" offset="9278568">There was no compulsion, there was no extra burden it was a pure voluntary choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.334" offset="9312737">It is also our position that the unitary trial is fundamentally fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.585" offset="10073736">We submit to this Court that as argued by counsel, the allocation statute in the State of Ohio as in most other states is really only a legal objection and it is so historically, and this Court has noted that distinction in the case of Schwab versus Berggren decided in 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.066" offset="10211662">As stated in me Government’s brief, it is usually something like be pleading of a pardon or any other type of legal objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.452" offset="10261191">It actually has nothing to do with the sentencing discretion regarding the defendant’s opportunity to give mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.686" offset="10298075">The only place where I could imagine that this plea of allocution under the Ohio statute reply would be where the defendant could claim that there is an insufficiency of the evidence upon which the verdict was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.261" offset="10376443">These are the normal things that will be brought up on a motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.759" offset="10402356">In regard further to allocution, the Court in Williams versus New York, Williams versus Oklahoma held that the due process clause did not require a hearing and to give a convicted person an opportunity to participate in a sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.217" offset="10504234">The Hill case in 1962, although not a capital case, specifically stated that allocution was not a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.702" offset="10558151">Petitioner claims his only claim as to elevating allocution to a constitutional right is base on the decision of the Court in Specht.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.883" offset="10618859">But that case is easily distinguishable, that case had its defendants upon another fact-finding determination which had to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.449" offset="10685210">From these cases, we submit that the petitioner’s reliance on cases such as Simmons, Jackson-Denno is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.492" offset="10733380">We are not dealing with two specific constitutional rights and we submit that the issue is very similar indeed to the case of Spencer versus Texas is a two-part trial necessary purely because the jury must decide two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.749" offset="10806418">We submit that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.597" offset="10853752">As noted in the discussion with Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.339" offset="10868694">In this case, the defendant’s mother did testify, there was testimony of two psychiatrists, there was testimony of a physician and there was introduced them to the record three different hospital records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.315" offset="10932642">All of these we submit can only serve one purpose and that was to mitigate the penalty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.058" offset="10979558">In this case, the petitioner did not take the stand and he then claim that the procedures of the unitary trial necessarily chilled the assertion of his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.131" offset="11043924">His decision to take the stand or not is a decision similar I submit to the guilty plea cases decided by this Court last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.378" offset="11100871">The question is, was it compelled?</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.040" offset="11107558">Was it a voluntary decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.467" offset="11133262">We state that the case of Williams versus Florida, the alibi -- notice of alibi case, this Court stated that the defendant faces such a dilemma demanding a choice between complete silence in presenting a defense has never been thought to be an invasion of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.940" offset="11239111">In the instant case, either impeachment evidence or similar acts of evidence was introduced into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.752" offset="11278399">If it had been, the Court under Ohio law would have had to give limiting instructions to the jury as to the nature of that evidence and how they could consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.113" offset="11339839">This Court has held that under the doctrine of Spencer versus Texas, those types of leavening instructions are perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.224" offset="11384247">The petitioner in this case introduced practically everything he could introduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.666" offset="11414026">If the procedure in Spencer versus Texas was fundamentally fair, were prior crime evidence was introduce without any question now I submit in a unitary capital case where impeachment is only possible if the defendant takes the stand that we have a trial more eminently fair than in Spencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.133" offset="11535862">We submit further that the sentencing in a unitary trial is rational when based on the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.118" offset="11587793">All of the facts in this case came out in that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.461" offset="11601168">All of the facts of the defendant’s background, the jury saw this defendant sitting there for the week that the case tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.279" offset="11640456">They saw the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.553" offset="11645576">They heard his psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.089" offset="11667728">We would also submit, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.663" offset="11678072">I would like to come back to one other thing the question of the jury instruction in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.273" offset="11728436">The Court will find in volume 1 of the record in this case that on the -- before their examination of the entire veneer of the juries, the Court did a little more than what was found in a final charge on it described the duties of juries functions when it came to the recommendation of mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.523" offset="11813491">The Court there stated that, that decision must be based upon the facts and circumstances in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.740" offset="11862288">We also submit to the Court that the alternative of the bifurcated trial is -- the alternative of a bifurcated trial is not free of potential harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.987" offset="11923310">Just again as in the guilty plea cases where this Court stated that it would not be fair or that would be cruel to make all defendants submit to a jury trial we respectfully submit that it would also be cruel to make all defendants submit to a penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.177" offset="12040129">The use of the unitary trial has a very long history in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.497" offset="12077328">Only six states as the Court has noted have the split verdict procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.236" offset="12100315">The States have a very valid interest and purpose in maintaining that unitary trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.363" offset="12136782">The alternative of bifurcation and I submit possibly trifurcation and quadfurcation, if a constitutional principle is to be announced could only add to the time, cost and complexity of criminal trials and appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.208" offset="12220165">That burden became very evident this very morning when it was stated that 69% of the penalty trials in California had been reversed requiring new juries, more court time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.284" offset="12288502">The extra burden would be disproportionate we submit to the alleged possible benefits and in some instances actually detrimental to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.071" offset="12355688">There have been cases where defendants have complained that they had to stand a penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.632" offset="12401873">We submit that the convenience of a single proceeding weighs heavily against an added procedure which this Court has stated is not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.432" offset="12473135">In regard to the standards issue, as I have stated in the bifurcated trial argument, the decision is based upon the evidence in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.052" offset="12535620">The Ohio Supreme Court cases have so held the Howell case, the Caldwell, the Shelton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.441" offset="12561115">The Ashbrook case which has been cited by the petitioner here that there can be no evidence introduced pointing towards mercy was a Court of Appeals case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.886" offset="12598941">The Supreme Court of the State of Ohio in this very case indirectly overruled the Court of Appeals holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.329" offset="12644707">I think that the question is ultimately, have any type of standards ever be attainable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.884" offset="12702908">We submit that it would be almost impossible to articulate any type of list of factors in advance for every conceivable situation that might arise in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.741" offset="12770304">To say that on one hand there are required findings a jury must make or to say no on the other hand that it is just a matter of reference to the jury so it can guide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.500" offset="12857344">We think is an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.623" offset="12869883">Constitutionally, if it is required it would have to be findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.573" offset="12893706">This Court in the past in the Winston case and in the Enbridge case approved full jury discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.472" offset="12937279">We don’t believe and we submit earnestly that regardless of any standards that the decisions of the juries would not be any different in what they are today and the two cases the Court is now hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.707" offset="13018154">The jury discretion expresses the conscience of the community as this Court has held in Witherspoon and it is in the end a value judgment as to the sentence and not to guilt and it should not be subject to the same formalities of the guilt determination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.130" offset="13131943">The long standing and widespread use of absolute discretion which this Court noted plus the fact that no Court has ever ruled in favor of the defendant on this particular issue and there had been many, many cases as cited in the briefs, we believe reflects that the principle of the unitary trial was standardless discretion to the jury is not only constitutionally sound but one in the administration of criminal justice is now required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.563" offset="13325667">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.714" offset="13602252">Much the same factors are included in the recently publish preliminary or study draft of a New Federal Criminal Code by the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws but it’s not surprising that they are very similar to those the Model Penal Code because Professor Schwartz who was the director of that study was the associate reporter for the American Law Institute Study of the Modern Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.385" offset="13744880">In the massive investigation into the actual experience in California which is published a year ago in the Stanford Law Review, there were some 175 factors which they work out and undertook to tabulate to see what the actual experience had been and I would hazard a guess that putting a 175 factors before a jury and in particular without any clear instruction is to how they should be weighed and I don’t know how such instructions could be given would not be a productive assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.678" offset="13942053">There’s one more factor with respect to standards that I think might be worth mentioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.848" offset="13966712">The statutory pattern in these two cases vary somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.455" offset="13989177">In California, the jury is given discretion to determine the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.004" offset="14015404">In Ohio, the statute provides that the penalty for first-degree murder is death but that if the jury recommends mercy and then it shall be life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.049" offset="14059604">There’s some suggestion in some of the briefs that this is a very vital distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.272" offset="14080502">I do not believe that it is any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.265" offset="14092413">I think that it is considering the solemnity and the obvious significance of the task with which the jury is confronted and all experience shows the juries are particularly properly selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.513" offset="14153435">Juries are extremely conscientious on this test that it does not make any difference either in result or in law as to which formulation is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.201" offset="14200142">Now, I will turn to the split trial or bifurcated trial issue which is presented only in the Crampton case and first, I would like to ask to enter a question asked by Mr. Justice Black, he asked when the question of the necessity for a bifurcated trial was first raised and we believed that it wasn’t in the New Jersey case cited in our brief at page 29 of State against Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.229" offset="14328247">And that was in 1961 and appeal was taken from that decision to this Court and it was dismissed for one of a substantial federal question in 1961.</text>

            <text syncTime="3673.468" offset="14797197">I am not, I do not believe it was ever contended that it was constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.854" offset="14818826">It has been contended that this was wise, safe penology and good way for state to set up its criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.577" offset="14857697">I have never seen a serious contention except in these cases that it is constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.072" offset="14887685">Incidentally, State against Johnson also involved the standards issue and there again the Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it did not raise a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.266" offset="14948394">With respect to the bifurcated trial, we have again a question that seems to me essentially is separation of powers even assuming that the bifurcated trial is a good thing or is a desirable innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.746" offset="15006386">Is this a determination which should be made by the people through their representatives in the legislatures or in Congress or is this something that this Court should now as an exercise of the judicial power find to be required by the very general language of the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.939" offset="15103143">This Court has already in various ways indicated that bifurcated trials are not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.714" offset="15138252">The clearest example is Spencer against Texas to which in reference has already been made and which is discuss at pages 84 and 87 of our brief decided just three years ago and with a clear statement there that there is no basis for finding it required by the Constitution whatever its merits may otherwise be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.282" offset="15244518">The constitutional intention -- constitutional contention made there was surely more serious than that advanced here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.994" offset="15283388">That case strikes me as a tougher case than this one do decide but the court did not accept it making it plain that the details or procedure in criminal cases are to a very great extent matters to be decided by the legislature of the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.338" offset="15360711">It may be noted too that this Court has never required a two-stage trial in the exercise of its supervisory power over the trial of federal criminal cases though such trials have been required or at least authorized in certain circumstances by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.207" offset="15456214">As I’ve been indicated, bifurcated trials have been adopted in this country now by six states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.763" offset="15478471">The first being California in 57 are experienced so far as relatively limited and the procedure is surely in the experimental stage hardly a situation for constitutional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.766" offset="15538448">Incidentally, California has trifurcated trials by the express provision of its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.562" offset="15561644">If there is an issue us to sanity, you have guilt sanity and penalty as separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.993" offset="15587349">It has been suggested that some other issues like alibi and self-defense are just logically susceptible to this treatment and you could have great multiplication on trials at least theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.685" offset="15646072">Now, it’s argued that split trials must be provided in order to avoid a violation of the defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.819" offset="15686614">But this contention will not with stand analysis as several decisions of this Court show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.863" offset="15714826">The guilty plea cases of last spring a very close to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.060" offset="15739591">But the privilege against self-incrimination does not mean that only matters adverse to the defendant are barred while he remains free to show those things which are favorable to him through his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.759" offset="15798418">On the contrary, the privilege means that the defendant cannot be called as a witness at his own criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.200" offset="15828198">On the other hand, he is always free to be a witness if he chooses but if he is a witness he is a witness for all purposes including cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.943" offset="15871143">The effort of the trial is to get at the truth including facts which are adverse to the defendant as well as those which are favorable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.808" offset="15910640">For basic policy reasons, the Constitution limits the effort to develop the truth by providing that the defendant cannot be compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.264" offset="15952436">That is his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.319" offset="15960691">It is for him to decide whether to exercise it, guided by the assistance of his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.964" offset="15983261">It is often a hard choice for the defendant would like to show favorable matters without getting himself involved in the unfavorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.415" offset="16020982">But the pressure comes from the facts which have been adduced that the trials through witnesses other than the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.951" offset="16047208">He is not deprived of his privilege merely because he would like to testify to favorable matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.354" offset="16076779">This is well-illustrated by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.894" offset="16090990">In fact, the defendant here did exercise his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.717" offset="16110216">He did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.804" offset="16118575">It cannot be said here that he was deprived of his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.999" offset="16135398">Moreover, as a matter of the record he did not ask for a bifurcated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.034" offset="16155460">It is true that the Law of Ohio does not provide for such a division of the trial but the fact remains that he did not seek it and there may well have been reasons for that decision as I shall explain in the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.808" offset="16214601">Moreover, he did have an opportunity to show favorable matters, true witnesses other than himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.507" offset="16245426">The defendant’s mother testified and he introduced substantial medical evidence on the insanity issue, thus, putting before the jury much material bearing on the defendant himself and his backgrounds a favorable to his interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.498" offset="16313344">It is true that he did not testify himself but that surely does not mean its exact opposite that he was denied his privilege against self-discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.404" offset="16360991">And indeed, this highlights the basic difficulty with the bifurcated trial as it has been developed in the six American States which now use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.062" offset="16407594">In the penalty trial, the State can and does show things adverse to the defendant which would not be admissible in the unitary trial and I think the McGautha case itself is a very clearly example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.065" offset="16467675">If there had not been a separate trial, much that was harmful to McGautha and much that serve to distinguish him from his co-defendant, I would not have before the jury because there was a separate penalty trial, the State showed the prior convictions, the two co-defendants testified each one trying to charge the other with having a fire to shot and the jury drew its conclusions from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.734" offset="16582301">Notable among the things which can be shown are the prior criminal convictions and other evidence reflecting adversely on the defendant’s character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.032" offset="16623470">Thoughtful students have concluded that a death penalty is more likely in a bifurcated trial than it is a unitary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.314" offset="16664639">Indeed, we might well have arguments before this Court that the bifurcated trial deprives the defendant of due process of law though such an argument would presumably be in effective in the light of this Court’s decision in such cases Spencer against Texas and the two Williams cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.416" offset="16753037">It would be improvident we believe to freeze this ambivalent procedure with its merits and demerits still elusive into a constitutional directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.185" offset="16800162">With a clear indication that separate penalty trials may have an adverse effect on defendants who are exposed to them, there is a need for prudent restraint in deciding that the Constitution requires their adoption as an integral feature of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.837" offset="16870693">Certainly, our experience with bifurcated capital trials over the past 13 years is empty of any genuine or compelling indication that such procedures are more fair to an accuse than the traditional unitary trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.300" offset="16944567">In this situation, a procedure never thought of when the due process clause became part of our Constitution in 1790 and again in 1868, you’ll remember in 1790 the trial had to be began and completed between sunup and sundown and never seriously advance in the first 175 years of our constitutional history should not now be read into the due process clause where it surely cannot be found by any accepted process of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.932" offset="17083120">If that were to be done perhaps it could be said that it would be hard to articulate the standard which lead to the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.957" offset="17119169">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4268.283" offset="17176534">I will not repeat what has been said generally with respects to standards but I would submit to the Court that Ohio as it has been suggested in a couple of briefs filed in this case could be considered to have a standard cited on page 20 of the petitioner’s brief is the case of Howell versus State in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that was error -- not error to charge the jury in the capital case “to consider and determine whether or not in view of all the circumstances and facts leading up to and attending the alleged homicide as disclosed by the evidence you should or should not make such recommendation of mercy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.128" offset="17383842">I will submit that that is merely an instruction to the jury that they should consider all of the evidence in the case and it may be a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.729" offset="17418324">But if not an adequate standard and it was not given in the Crampton case, the only instruction that was given to the jury that is other, that is the seated jury, the 12 people appears at page 5 of the petitioner’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.374" offset="17504841">If you find the defendant guilty of murder on the first degree the punishment is death unless you recommend mercy in which case it is life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.665" offset="17533994">But the instruction goes on and is diametrically opposed to the instruction which follow the penalty trial in California and the instruction which appears at page 6 of the brief says you must not be influenced by any considerations of sympathy or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.387" offset="17608913">I submit that when you tell the jury that one of the things that must not consider is sympathy, you have effectively stopped any argument by the defendant for mercy in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.779" offset="17686444">The distinguished Solicitor General has indicated that the single verdict trial, the bifurcated trial would be available also to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.558" offset="17733569">In cases of self-defense defenses or in case of alibi defenses, the distinction that I would point out with reference to those two observations is that both of this matters self-defense and alibi relate to the question of the defendants guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.461" offset="17813191">They do not go to the question of his punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4751.309" offset="19108655">What are the grounds for granting mercy in the case and there is a colloquy there between the judge and the foreman of the jury that betrays the jury’s curiosity as to the standards necessary for the granting of mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.732" offset="19174275">Even to the point where they want to consider the sociological and environmental factors in it and it’s possible that these standards should not be as detailed as the standards in the Model Penal Code but there should be some guidelines given to the jury so that they could move ahead on this question of standards with guidelines rather than operate in the vacuum as they appear to be doing in Caldwell case which we have cited.</text>
