            <text syncTime="2.088" offset="8255">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.932" offset="23719">Yesterday, I pointed out that since the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, managing other people’s money’s in various fiduciary capacities has been a traditional banking function.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.015" offset="80039">And that the individual managing agency account has been one way of performing that function along with testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, executorships and the like and other forms of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.364" offset="137404">In the beginning, the Federal Reserve Board followed the common law and forbade National Banks to commingle the assets of different beneficiaries or different principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.556" offset="190171">About 1920, it began relax that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.456" offset="205740">And in 1937, there came a major relaxation that permitted the commingling of the 101 of different trust executorships and guardianships and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.022" offset="260075">And under that new regulation, the now familiar common trust fund grew and flourished.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.923" offset="291631">Partly, I think because the economies of commingling which reduced the management cost and partly because of the advantages of diversification.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.110" offset="348369">The statute goes back to 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.341" offset="361326">The commingling was not authorized until about 1920 then on a very small scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.784" offset="387135">And then commingling on the scale that we’re all familiar with for the common trust fund came in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.299" offset="417123">But in 1937, the rule was not relaxed so far as individual managing agency accounts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.314" offset="453172">It was relaxed for all other fiduciary capacity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="127.901" offset="511582">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.835" offset="519314">The effect of Regulation 9 which is an issue in the next case is to extend to managing agencies, the same privilege to commingle that it proved to be successful and so free from abuse in the case of trust and that kind of fiduciary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.375" offset="605414">Indeed, if you will look -- when you come to look at Regulation 9, you would see that it treats commingling strict trust funds and managing agency funds in exactly parallel capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.207" offset="668735">The reasons for this were very well stated somewhat later by the Federal Reserve Board in a letter to the Congress speaking of the public interest in having banks continue to offer this kind of managing agency commingled investment account and a letter quoted in the back of our brief on page 35 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="190.210" offset="760790">We had pointed out that there were three advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.164" offset="772598">First, this was a means of performing a traditional banking function more efficiently and at less cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.359" offset="805407">Second, that it provided competition for the mutual funds which of course in these cases are seeking to preserve a monopolistic or quasi-monopolistic position free from competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.442" offset="853682">And third, that in special cases, it enabled a combination of investment and other special fiduciary services.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.245" offset="892970">During the time that Regulation 9 was under consideration, the Securities in Exchange Commission took the position that any commingled fund of managing agency accounts would be subject to the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.642" offset="966531">It said that the interest in the fund would be securities, that the fund or the bank would be an issuer or underwriter and that consequently, there had to be registration under the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.982" offset="1027866">I would point out in this connection however and indeed emphasize that while the SEC and Chairman Cary and Chairman Cohen stood very stoutly on the position that there must be conformity with the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.867" offset="1087425">They never took the view that the managing agency commingled investment account.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.692" offset="1106756">It was unlawful or in anyway against the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.742" offset="1122952">Indeed from the very beginning, Chairman Cary later Chairman Cohen and the staff all indicated that they would look favorably at exempting a managing agency commingled investment account.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.851" offset="1179376">For many of the provisions of the Investment Company Act that might be a bar to performing the function authorized by the comptroller under Regulation 9 and later approved by the Federal Reserve Board.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="307.646" offset="1230576">Now if there were about a single investor of the 1940 Act would not be applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.273" offset="1261087">And the 1940 Act would not be applicable to the type of common trust fund involving an Inter-Vivo or Testamentary Trust because it is expressly exempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.181" offset="1332663">No, that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.482" offset="1337887">It was the pooling that the SEC said brought it under the Investment Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.187" offset="1364741">Wasn’t it plus the issuing of certificates of participation or whatever you call it, the selling of shares?</text>

            <text syncTime="350.514" offset="1402044">I think their position was that even if there were no piece of paper, it would be the interest, the undivided interest would nevertheless be regarded as something that brought them under the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.834" offset="1471321">That’s my understanding of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.466" offset="1489816">Of course as we do it there are those certificates.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="378.543" offset="1514162">For a purpose I suppose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="380.868" stopTime="611.095">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="380.868" offset="1523461">For the purpose of carrying -- we say for the purpose of carrying out our fiduciary responsibilities and for no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.422" offset="1561600">It was a controversy between the comptroller and the commission which led to congressional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.602" offset="1594305">During that controversy, City Bank developed the plan in which it was believed would comply both with the requirements of the banking laws and be satisfactory to the SEC under the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.294" offset="1653133">And what it contemplated was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.076" offset="1664209">City Bank would continue to receive assets in their fiduciary capacity under the relation of managing agent and principle with all the fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.772" offset="1711020">And it was discretion to invest those through a common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.761" offset="1734949">To the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act, the common fund or account as it came to be called, was given a separate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.226" offset="1780820">The principles, the customer investors were given Certificates of Participation which were nonassignable and nontransferable which would terminate upon their death.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.491" offset="1833900">The certificate holders were given the right to choose as they wished a committee made up of five individuals as it developed, two of whom were not required to be connected with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.917" offset="1895654">And the committee or the participants were given power to terminate the bank’s investment adviser contract and anytime at the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.075" offset="1944242">That subject however to the possibility of that is very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.258" offset="1960960">The bank has a custody of all the assets, manages, tends to them in every way, chooses what investments to make and to change and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.412" offset="2001607">So, in the ordinary day-to-day operation, the whole thing is carried out by the bank subject only to this possibility of the certificate holders exercising common control to kick the bank out.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.895" offset="2063569">There are a few other minor departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.214" offset="2076839">They’re outlined in our brief in footnote 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.736" offset="2090841">None of them, I think affect the theory or the fiduciary relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.864" offset="2111425">Certainly none affect the individual fiduciary relation between the bank and the customer investor’s principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.042" offset="2144131">And the bank continues to be required to conform.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.887" offset="2159491">In all respects except I’ve mentioned and the other details to the provisions of regulation that.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.132" offset="2188434">Now, from the standpoint of the banking laws, it seemed important that all these activities be conducted as the Federal Reserve Board later put it as an arm or department of the bank as one of many functions within the trust department of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.601" offset="2250397">And while the managing -- while the investment advisers contract alone might be enough to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.144" offset="2296477">It seemed advisable to the bank and its lawyers that a majority of the Board of Directors should also be officers of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.359" offset="2329391">And it was that that led to the application for an exemption from Section 10(c) which provides that a bank may not have a majority of the Board of Directors of an investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.652" offset="2382576">When the matter came before the SEC, it made three critical findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.851" offset="2411311">The first on page 60, points out that this account which is technically an investment company.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.899" offset="2467527">It pointed out that this was not the kind of investment company and at with Section 10(c) appeared to be (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="625.376" offset="2501486">Although Section 10(c) is general in terms, it does not appear that it was directed at the type of open-ended investment company represented by the account and then skipping a few sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.278" offset="2549029">It is clear that the account is substantially different both in purpose and nature of operation from the bank dominated investment companies which led to passage of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.810" offset="2599184">The second finding is over on page 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.894" offset="2619559">In our opinion in the commission sent, the bank you shown that substantial safeguards are present here against conflicts of interest which could arise as a result of the bank’s commercial banking activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.948" offset="2675775">And the third finding which is in flaccid is that the exemption to permit these activities to go forward would be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.779" offset="2727079">We submit first in our legal argument that if these findings are reasonable, these conclusions are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.178" offset="2764696">Then, the commissions order is plainly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.459" offset="2781832">Section 6(c) of the statute which is on the back of our brief on page 7(a) plainly gives the commission the power to exempt any person conditionally or unconditionally from any provision or provisions of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.077" offset="2856229">Surely the words in a provision or provision to this title are broad enough to encompass the provisions of Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="722.935" offset="2891651">And the fact that literally the bank, the account that falls within Section 10(c), does not defeat the power to exempt because of course the very purpose of the power to exempt is to take care of cases which literally fall within the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.560" offset="2962181">Furthermore, that has been the consistent interpretation of Section 10(c) for 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.169" offset="2996663">It was explained to Congress when Section 10(c) was pending before it in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.624" offset="3018397">That the aim was to take care of cases which had not been foreseen by the drafts which might fall within the literal language of the statute but in the judgment of the commission not really within its policy or spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.960" offset="3079837">At the time, Section 10(c) was before Congress, there was no commingling of managing agency accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.653" offset="3118602">Common trust funds, the nearest analog were exempted from the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.203" offset="3144725">And consequently I suggest that if the commission’s findings are reasonable then this is a classic case for an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.137" offset="3184536">The commission’s finding that the proposed relationship between City Bank and the account is not the kind addressed by Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="805.810" offset="3223197">It seems to me to be supported by five considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.670" offset="3246602">First, the type of Investment Company with which Congress was concerned in 1940 when it was debating Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="821.249" offset="3284950">Was a close-end investment company, a fixed pool of securities which bank insiders were selling very largely in the hope of making their own profit, a company in which they certainly had an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.670" offset="3346599">This account of course, is wholly the property of the customers, the principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.780" offset="3375020">It’s run solely for their benefit and the bank gets nothing more from it than the usual fee that it gets for any fiduciary service of the subject to the comptroller of the currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.473" offset="3425802">Second, those investment companies for the most part purported to be independent concerns with as -- when the customer but it’s not the customer, when the investor bought a share, he thought he was buying a share in the Investment Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.580" offset="3494243">And if the bank through its control over the directors dominated it, he wasn’t getting something free from the influence of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.497" offset="3533949">Here of course when he goes to the bank and opens his managing agency account.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.272" offset="3553071">What he is looking for is the bank services.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.344" offset="3565296">And what he gets subject to this power of ultimate control is the bank services throughout the entire enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.893" offset="3607510">Third, I would emphasize that there is in this instance but not in the kind of Investment Company at which Section 10(c) is concerned, a direct fiduciary relation between the bank and the individual customer investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.447" offset="3997780">They may make no loans to the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.825" offset="4007288">They may have no interest in the securities that the account acquires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.381" offset="4025469">Indeed, Regulation 9 even would restrict the bank from buying securities of companies to which it has made a shaky loan, of where that would be a breach of trust and the controller’s representatives have instructed to be on the lookout for such things in the instruction we’ve putted on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.661" offset="4122540">I would emphasize that this direct fiduciary relationship was noted by the District Court in the ICI case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.084" offset="4156291">It spelled out in the Hoga affidavit, the Executive Vice President of the bank in the ICI case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.356" offset="4185339">It was also noted by the Court of Appeals and the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.955" offset="4203729">A fourth difference between the Investment Company at which Section 10(c) was directed and the account is of course that the securities affiliates and the Associated Investment Companies at which Section 10(c) was directed were set out for the purpose of evading the banking laws and getting out from under scrutiny of the controller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.218" offset="4308846">I Perhaps shouldn’t say vague but avoid, I don’t meant there was any deceit about it whereas all these activities are carried on as I said a moment ago constantly under the control of the controller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.268" offset="4369032">The result is from those four differences that none of the evils which were pointed to during the investigation and the bank securities affiliates and bank dominated investment companies are possible the presence setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.328" offset="4441234">Indeed, not even the petitioners argue that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.825" offset="4463282">Mr. Lewin(ph) argues that the SEC findings are immaterial because Section 10(c) imposes a rigid barrier to the banks ever having a majority on the Board of Directors where there is any possible conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.593" offset="4542276">Even so it’s found that this is not the kind of thing that 10(c) was directed at, even so the commission finds that there are adequate safeguards and even so the commission finds that the existence of the account is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.086" offset="4608313">I submit that that argument is unsupportable for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.396" offset="4625554">First, it’s certainly contrary to the plain words of Section 6(c) which give power to exempt without restriction except for the necessary findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.200" offset="4672784">Second, and very important, the characteristics of the account or the relationship between the bank and the account that are said to give rise to the danger of abuse here are characteristics that are attendant upon all fiduciary banking functions and we know that Congress didn’t find them so dangerous as to prohibit this kind of relationship because it authorized such fiduciary banking functions in Section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act now Title 12 Section 92(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.909" offset="4823562">It would certainly be incongruous if Congress somehow had singled out this one special form of activity which is just like the others, so far as any of these problems are concerned, and forbidden it, especially since in this case, but has not only the usual safeguards of the fiduciary relationship in the controller supervision but one has the additional safeguards of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.041" offset="4940069">We’ve outlined in our brief, a number of indications as the commission did in its opinion that the board was -- that the Congress was not seeking such a rigid separation between banks and investment companies as Mr. Levin argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.017" offset="5016033">There’s a grandfather clause in Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.443" offset="5029721">Banks are allowed to act as investment advisers which from a day-to-day point of view is the really controlling manager of the investing company and of course, we lay great stress on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.481" offset="5081861">The one form of commingling that was none at the time the Investment Company Act was adopted, the common trust fund was exempted from the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.327" offset="5125224">An important analog even though the commission said we couldn’t bring ourselves within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.715" offset="5154795">The remaining question is whether there was adequate support for the SEC findings that there were adequate safeguards against abuse of the banks control over the fund to the detriment of investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.363" offset="5217384">The commission took up point by point all the abuses which it was said might result and found that they were not sufficiently serious and that they were adequate safeguards against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.545" offset="5278093">Judge Bazelon took them up point by point as the same arguments were made to the controller and he rejected them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.805" offset="5307141">The Federal Reserve Board scrutinized most of them in the letter that is set forth at the end of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.969" offset="5339847">And it concluded too that there were adequate safeguards and that the existence of such funds would be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.265" offset="5377045">Consequently, we submit that the commission’s findings are reasonably based in the record and that its judgment ended its order, should therefore be affirmed and the order -- and the judgment of the court below affirm.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1375.612" offset="5502433">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.798" offset="5519151">At the outset, I would just like to explain in view of the somewhat unusual posture of this case that the commission is not appearing here in defense of its order one, why the United States is appearing in this case and secondly, why we think that the commission’s position in this case does not undermine the validity of it’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.412" offset="5617580">As it’s been indicated when the commission granted this exemption in 1966, the vote was four to one with a strong dissent against the grant of the exemption by Commissioner Badge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.629" offset="5674423">The commission vigorously defended its order early in 1967 before the Court of Appeals and that Court unanimously upheld the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.572" offset="5722279">Now, by the time the case reach this Court however and this Court had granted the petition there had been a significant change in the membership of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.875" offset="5763448">Three of the five commissioners who had originally participated in the case were no longer on the commission and of the remaining two, one is Mr. Bage(ph) who by that point had become chairman, had voted against the exemption that the other commissioner had voted in favor of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.540" offset="5830113">And it was in that posture that the commission advised the solicitor general in June of 1970, that it was taking a position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.389" offset="5869505">This is the statement that Mr. Levin read to the Court yesterday from page three of the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.238" offset="5892911">And I just like to reiterate two of the sentences that the commission included in its statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.661" offset="5918616">The commission said, the three subsequently appointed members of the commission are not prepared to take any position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.830" offset="5947246">This was after the commission had pointed out that there are only two remaining members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.777" offset="5963024">And one was -- had voted for and one had voted against the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.806" offset="5979220">Accordingly, the commission expresses no position on the merits and urges neither affirmance nor reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.292" offset="6017149">Now, we think what in effect the commission has said to us in this case is that it is not able at this time to master a quorum to decide what position to take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.400" offset="6065528">Only two members of the commission at that point were prepared to vote on what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.098" offset="6100323">We strongly disagree with Mr. Levin’s characterization of the commission’s action yesterday as that the commission had disavowed its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.909" offset="6139611">The commission has not disavowed its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.628" offset="6150478">If I may just mix an athletic metaphor for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.148" offset="6164584">The commission in this case contrary to petitioner's suggestion has not thrown in the tile on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.117" offset="6184438">It is merely sitting this one out on the sidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.336" offset="6265313">Yes, it’s the one that says there’s no assurance that the commission would reach the same judgment if a similar matter is again presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.263" offset="6289032">I think that merely is a rather briefer statement of what was said in the original brief that is as of that time the commission didn’t know what its position would be because there are only two of the original commissioners then available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.789" offset="6359144">I would like to just say that the commission has not disavowed its decision and it seems to us that basically, the validity of the commission's action must be determined on what happened when it acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.055" offset="6412121">Not on the basis of the fact that sometime thereafter there had been changes in the membership of the agency and that the present membership is not prepared now to state, what position it would take if the issue came before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.467" offset="6461858">Indeed, there's another change in the offering in the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.438" offset="6473665">We talked about shifts in membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.634" offset="6482442">Chairman Badge who was the lone dissenter has announced his retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.469" offset="6497802">So that presumably by the time this case gets back to the commission, there’ll only be one of the original commissioners and we think that the commission by definition is a continuing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.553" offset="6542211">It continues as an entity without regard to changes in its membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.637" offset="6562482">And that if the commission’s action was valid when it was taken, it should be upheld even though changes in the body since that time might suggest that if the commission would have considered anew, the commission might come up the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.703" offset="6626743">The commission in this case has not asked this Court to remand the case -- for it to take another look at the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.550" offset="6654119">And I think the reason it hasn’t done that is again the same reason that there is no majority of the commission that it’s prepared to take any position at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.966" offset="6747847">No, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.909" offset="6751608">We were not but we came in to the case because it was our belief that in view of the importance of this issue and in view of the fact that the Court of Appeals had unanimously upheld the commission’s order, we thought it was not appropriate that the validity of the audit should just be defended by the bank which had received the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.512" offset="6826005">We thought there is an interest to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.994" offset="6831961">And in addition to that although we haven’t set it forth in our brief, the Government, the solicitor general representing all Government agencies has an interest in the basic legal issue here which is the scope of judicial review of an agency or granting an exemption, a question that this Court has not directly dealt with as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.604" offset="6918374">Well, this is the way of background as to why we think it was appropriate to give weight to the discretion of the commission in this case even though the commission is not here appearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.587" offset="6966335">In defense of its order, I’d like to turn briefly to the merits which Mr. Cocks has fully covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.949" offset="6995696">And why we think that in this case, the commission clearly has not abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.939" offset="7015654">The statute under which the commission granted this exemption Section 6(c) gives the commission authority in the broadest possible terms that allows it to exempt any person, any transaction from any class of persons, from any provision of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.044" offset="7088170">And there is certainly nothing in that sweeping language that in anyway suggests that Section 10 of the Act is not within the commission’s power to exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.906" offset="7131533">What we think the Congress is obviously contemplated by this Section is that the commission shall have authority to exempt any transaction, any person, any security within its terms, if the particular thing for which exemption is sought comes within these public interest factors that are listed as the conditions for the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.196" offset="7216692">That is if the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the purpose is fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.555" offset="7266220">Now, the determination, the weighing of these many factors that make up to this broad public interest standard is of necessity, something that calls for a very difficult, close, and subtle factors of balancing of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.567" offset="7326198">This is not the kind of thing that is capable of precise measurement, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.197" offset="7344692">You can’t take a yardstick and say whether it reaches a certain point and therefore is or is not consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.428" offset="7377711">The granting of an exemption, the decision whether or not the public interest standards are met in this kind of a case is really the essence of administrative discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.177" offset="7412611">It’s the kind of thing that necessarily has to be within the discretion of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.352" offset="7433404">And we have developed in our brief and as Mr. Cox has indicated at some length, the commission certainly in this case did not abuse its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.782" offset="7471125">The basic evils at which 10 Section (c) was directed are not the evils present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.499" offset="7501949">Section 10(c) was put into the Act because of a lot of abuses that had been shown to have taken place in the 1920’s in the way in which the banks operated these investment affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.414" offset="7549597">What the banks were doing, they were using the investment affiliates as methods for speculating in the Securities market and they were unloading on the investment companies, a lot of the speculative securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.802" offset="9811174">I think the whole question of self dealing is another problem in this which is the bank is a fiduciary and its relationships with the participants in the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.375" offset="9853492">And if what the bank does, if it should sell something to the account in a way they violate its fiduciary obligations, I would think that the bank would run afoul of that and of course the controllers constantly inspecting these banks, and inspects them three times every two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.296" offset="9917127">It's trust department inspects the account of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.709" offset="9934785">And as a result of this, if they soar any existence of this self dealing, it seems to me it would be quickly corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.553" offset="9970207">So that on balance as I say, we think that this is an area within the commission’s discretion, and that the commission has not abused its discretion in granting the exemption here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.263" offset="10052963">Mr. Justice Black may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.094" offset="10072294">I wanted to clarify a response that I gave yesterday in connection with the question that Mr. Justice Harlan directed with respect to the commission's use of Section 6(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.261" offset="10120986">I said that exempt of authority was used frequently and it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.151" offset="10144601">But I did not mean that it was used frequently in connection with Section 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.732" offset="10166857">The commission has used Section 6(c) in two cases both on the same day back in 1959 in an opposed order and there was no opinion but the -- in those cases in one of them -- all of the stock of the investment company and it was not an open-ended investment company regarding variety of investment company of the kind that we have in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.192" offset="10288692">But rather a small business investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.348" offset="10301336">It’s a special arrangement designed to facilitate loans to small business concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.611" offset="10334354">In one of the cases all of the stock of the small business investment company was owned by the bank itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.643" offset="10366537">In the other case, the stock was owned by the bank and by a trustee for the benefit of stockholders and in the recitals in those particular orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.611" offset="10410423">In both orders, there’s the same recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.043" offset="10424111">And the recital is that the applicant investment company believes that it’s entitled to the exemption and I quote, in view of the fact that the public investor interest in applicant investment company is confined to the shareholders of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.482" offset="10489835">So that there we have the very much different situation than we have here because you don’t have the potential conflicts of interest between the bank and the investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.883" offset="10539468">Now, in terms of the scope of the statute, I simply want to make it clear that the type of relationship, the commingled agency account is a relationship that is very specifically reached by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.209" offset="10644793">The legislative history refers to the situation of the commingled agency account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.260" offset="10673006">It’s not a bank sponsored account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.706" offset="10682723">But there was a situation specifically referred to in the legislative history of where certain people had deposited money on an agency basis with an individual and that individual managed the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.862" offset="10747402">He pooled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.618" offset="10754403">And the legislative history treats that particular commingled managed agency account as an investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.229" offset="10792856">Indeed, the commission in its report to the Congress in the first volume of the investment trust study in part one at page 24 in talking of the types of relationships that give rise to the investment company refers to the corporate form, to the Massachusetts Trust, to the Joint Stock Company and lastly to the agency relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.333" offset="10897241">And I want to quote from that report “it’s a brief passage which indicates what the commission was thinking about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.487" offset="10925871">Another distinctive form of organization of investment companies involves an agency relationship between the individual contributors to the fund and the management upon whom they confer substantially a power of Attorney to act as agent in the investment of the monies contributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.464" offset="11013851">The group of individuals is not a legal entity but rather constitutes in essence the combination of distinct individual interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.726" offset="11054811">Now, the problem of the commingled account and as I say not in terms of the bank but the general concept of the commingled account is considered in considerable detail in the commission's opinion in the Prudential case which was affirmed by the Third Circuit, the citation is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.597" offset="11138299">And there’s a full exploration of that particular aspect of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.465" offset="11161809">Now, with respect to the exemption for the common trust fund that’s been referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.832" offset="11195246">The commission itself in this very Prudential case that I just referred to indeed in the Third Circuit adopted the very language of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.227" offset="11232862">The commission said the following, it referring to the Congress rested this exemption on the special considerations that the funds were used for bonafide the fiduciary purposes rather than as a medium for general public investment and had only a limited impact in the investment fund picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.083" offset="11312274">And that the commission did prepare as part of this Investment Trust study, did prepare a special small volume, pamphlet dealing with the matter of the Common Trust Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.430" offset="11365669">Now, point number one, the commission did not make an extensive study of the Common Trust Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.752" offset="11390955">One of the -- investigating to the matter of the abuses that were involved in the operation of the Common Trust Fund --</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.527" offset="11446021">And the commission pointed out and one of the reasons for it was is that at time, they were all tools and 16 common trust funds in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.243" offset="11480921">And in the aggregate they represented that I believe about $36 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.888" offset="11499520">There was nothing of consequence in terms of the common trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.429" offset="11513626">And the commission pointed out in that report that the participation in the fund and I’m quoting now “in the common trust fund is not available to the general public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.044" offset="11560124">And indeed, the commission at that time in providing the exemption for the common trust fund had before it, the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board with reference to common trust funds and one of the specific provisions in the regulations of the common trust fund at that time and these appear in the appendix to the commission’s study on the commingled trust account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.692" offset="11670674">The regulations refer to the fact that the common trust fund means a fund maintained by a National Bank exclusively for the collective investment and reinvestment of monies contributed thereto by the bank in its capacity, its trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.230" offset="11748833">And then it goes on to say and this is of particular significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.640" offset="11766491">The purpose of this section is to permit the use of common trust funds as defined in Section 169 of the Revenue Act of 1936, for the investment of funds held by true fiduciary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.837" offset="11819259">And then it goes on and the operation of such common trust funds as investment trusts for other than strictly fiduciary purposes is forbidden.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.928" offset="12287687">He could use the trust relationship, create the trust but as I say in terms of the scope of the regulation as it was administered by the Federal Reserve Board was that the trust relationship was not to be used as it is being used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.556" offset="12358217">Actually, it isn’t a trust relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.728" offset="12366890">It’s called a commingled account where in effect you go out and create a common package of securities for all commerce to come in and make an investment in what is a mutual fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.953" offset="12423732">And the Federal Reserve Board as it administered the common trust fund provision that said if you do have an individualized relationship, the kind of thing that you have in a trust relationship where you can pool it but you cannot go up and create an investment company and use the common trust fund as a device to solicit or public participations which is precisely what is being created here and it is for that very reason that the commission had said that it’s subject to Investment Company.</text>
