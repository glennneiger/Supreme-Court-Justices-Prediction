            <text syncTime="25.592" offset="205720">This case is unique I think in the annals of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.753" offset="226408">The question presented has never before been presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.768" offset="254412">The question, does equal protection of the laws under Fourteenth Amendment mean majority rule in special elections to determine questions of public policy?</text>
            <text syncTime="52.991" offset="315329">Put it in another way, does the 60% requirement, the extraordinary majority requirement of the constitution and enabling statutes of the state of West Virginia violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="68.034" offset="375515">The facts in the case are not in dispute, they're simple and they're brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.058" offset="399653">In my home county, Roane County in West Virginia on April 1968, the Board of Education submitted to the people for decision, two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.138" offset="443956">The first question was whether or not to issue of a $1,800,000.00 in general obligation bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.026" offset="471437">Second issue is whether or not to increase the rate of taxation for current expenditures beyond the constitutionally prescribed maximum for a period of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.820" offset="526608">On each of these issues, approximately 51.51% of the persons voting, voted in the affirmative and of course the issues failed the passage to canvas by the Board of Education because of the requisite 60% of the voters did not approve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.648" offset="622007">Constitution of the state of West Virginia was adopted in 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.094" offset="635800">At that time the 60% requirement so far as bond indebtedness or any indebtedness extending beyond the current fiscal year was part of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.045" offset="679581">In 1932, the Tax Limitation Amendment was adopted which set forth maximum tax rates for each political subdivision and this limitation amendment provide that these rates could not be exceeded except by vote of the people and 60% voting in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.447" offset="745200">In 1966, an amendment was presented to the people of West Virginia and the only question in that amendment was whether or not to amend and cancel the 60% requirement and substitute a simple majority requirement and the people voted by a majority to retain the 60% rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.100" offset="831822">Despite this background -- in light of this background, the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of West Virginia decided at the instance of five citizens of our county, allegedly voted in the affirmative on each of these issues, that the 60% requirement, the extraordinary majority requirement was inherently discriminatory in that it diluted or debased the vote of the persons who voted yes as compared to the vote of the persons who voted no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.733" offset="5622262">There is in my brief the argument that was advanced in Georgetown Law journal which does set out many reasons that could exist here to justify such a state provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.559" offset="5669595">There are just a couple of things about the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.366" offset="5676805">I know that the in the allocation of senators, when used for college, of course necessary concessions are made at the time of the original (Inaudible) but we're dealing here with the Fourteenth Amendment and I think that if we recall that the Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.809" offset="5738559">Our Court has said that the Equal Protection Clause forbids an extraordinary majority requirement and yet by Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, dealing with disqualification of officers specifically said, that Congress can buy two-thirds of vote and remove those disqualifications seems highly irregular to me to suggest that one Section of this amendment forbids an extraordinary majority requirement in the next section or the third section requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.159" offset="5836048">And in 1967 the Twenty-fifth Amendment (Inaudible) getting down in more recent history provides for an extraordinary majority vote by Congress in determining whether or not the President does continue to disable -- not able to perform the duties in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.469" offset="5893204">So, I think that -- to summarize my presentation that there's no specific language of a constitution which requires this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.833" offset="5922670">There is no specific holding of this Court which require this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.384" offset="5936880">There's no natural law or rule of reason which requires this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.367" offset="5952867">Our -- framework of our government is based upon a delicate balance of instances of minority veto such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.605" offset="5985782">Bicameral legislatures, this doctrine separation of powers, doctrine of the judicial supremacy, the executive veto, all instances of minority veto and it seems to me that if majority rules, strict majority is to become the only acceptable way of political life in the state and local affairs of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.826" offset="6066657">We must recognize that we've embarked upon a new journey of uncertain duration down a new avenue of judicial activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.164" offset="6188074">In our view, we're dealing here with a voting, an election case that of course does determine questions of whether or not bonds maybe issued or excess levies applied, but it also equally determines whether or not a school will be built for the use of students 20 years in the future as well as the issue of paying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.391" offset="6308968">There is certainly no requirement to our knowledge that the West Virginia Constitution was required to submit to the voter an issue such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.541" offset="6365497">But it is refreshing that it does do so on such an important matter, education and having done so it seems to us that as all roads once led to Rome, the well-established pass of the decisions of this Court and the denial of the vote cases and in the waiting and debasement and dilution cases as well as discrimination of subject matter as found in Hunter versus Erickson are applicable here because there is in effect no doubt, but that the person who because of his conviction on the issue of whether or not bond shall be issued, determined whether or not his vote is to be counted 50% more than that of another of opposite conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.595" offset="11241723">As was pointed out early in connection with our provision of the Constitution involved here, the hope was expressed that this would have something to do with preventing that (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.552" offset="11301595">Well as a matter of fact, the 30 odd states that have no such provision in their constitutions or laws seem to be able to be just as economical and handle these matter just as effectively as the 16 or 17 which clearly do contain provisions of this kind either in their organic law or in their statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.679" offset="11402115">As a matter of fact, there has been a great body of sophisticated knowledge respecting bond issues and taxes that has grown up in recent years, the rating services and matters of that kind which go –– do much better job that respective legislative or constitutional provisions do in attempting to prevent the local governmental bodies from going overboard and making extravagant expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.935" offset="11527084">On that basis, we respectfully submit that the West Virginia Supreme Court correctly decided this issue as did California.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.786" offset="11570552">Thank you Mr. Wise.</text>

            <label>Mr. George M. Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="2873.916" offset="11599078">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.489" offset="11605347">By way of rebuttal, I would like to respond to two of three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.330" offset="11652681">Mr. Wise has made the point at the last that 30 odd states that don't have this rule, don't seemed to be spendthrifts and getting alright, but I think it is also well to remember that the 20 odd states which do have, at least a great percentage of them as far as we know are getting all right in the fields of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.056" offset="11719555">This does not seemed to have been great hindrance to them in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.474" offset="11741288">The question that Mr. Justice Black asked was very intriguing, who decides where lines are to be drawn in this case and of course I would love to argue that this is political question, non-justiciable and if there was anything left in that political non-justiciable political question in theory, I think this would be a classic example for its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.284" offset="11828537">I would like to remind again also that we're dealing here not with the question of minority rule, but the question of minority veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.483" offset="11857272">It seems to me that minority rule would be much more constitutionally impermissible than minority veto, and yet we elect the officers everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.557" offset="11909622">I understand the last election, elected senators from the larger states by 39% or something like that of the votes cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.696" offset="11942118">We elect governors, we elect members of the legislatures and we elect -- as I recall in this of course is not in the record but the last man elected to the board of education of Roane county received less than 30% of the total vote cast in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.671" offset="12002095">So they have many instances of minority rule which I think are much worst than this, and this is of course just minority veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.029" offset="12043473">I do not see anything wrong with protecting minorities as I said earlier, I think that is what the Fourteenth Amendment is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.103" offset="12071790">Then the use of this word, wait, I think it might have caused some of the -- what I considered to be confusion on the part of lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.709" offset="12126229">I am not suggesting that I could have used a better word, I am not sure that I understand what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.670" offset="12138036">It does have a mathematical connotation when we should I think are dealing with philosophical definition of this word equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.678" offset="12174085">And I recall that the lower court quoted opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas In Gray versus Sanders in which he -- it was stated that only -- the only essence of weighting of votes sanctioned by the constitution was in the makeup of the senate and used for electoral college.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.816" offset="12254647">But they emphasized the world only, if the only essence of weighting a vote sanctioned by the constitution of those two then of course the next ordinary majority requirement wouldn't be in essence of weighting a vote because there are certainly several constitutional areas where extra ordinary majority votes are required.</text>
