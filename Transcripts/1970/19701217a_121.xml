            <text syncTime="39.853" offset="262771">I think it's fortuitous that the morning ends with the case that involves a different kind of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.833" offset="294745">We have here a criminal contempt case arising from Pennsylvania which is in my research unprecedented in the law of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.187" offset="344168">We have a defendant who was on trial in 1966 under two very serious charges for prison breach and for holding hostage, in the course of a prison breach, charges which had a potential of life imprisonment under the second of those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.374" offset="436851">The trial lasted 22 days, 22 trial days, it stretched from November 7 until December 22 on a calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.941" offset="475094">During those 22 days of the defendant and two co-defendants were representing themselves on these very serious charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.186" offset="512084">At the conclusion of the trial, after the jury verdict had been brought in on 22nd day, the trial judge opened the next session of Court on Monday morning and excoriated all three defendants, summarily convicted them of criminal contempt and held that as to 11 separate days, although, there were multiple incidents involved, that petitioner Mayberry had been guilty of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.269" offset="652413">On each one of those 11 charges as he recited the facts as he recalled them, he imposed a sentence of a minimum of one year and a maximum of two years in state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.968" offset="707271">After each one of those sentences following the first, he directed that each one of those sentences be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.328" offset="744678">So that the first of his impositions of sentence was a sentence in aggregation of 11 years at a minimum and 22 years at a maximum for criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.184" offset="792116">Now, clarify for me if you will Mr. Reitz the relationship of these sentences collectively to the sentence on the substantive charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.738" offset="838301">He then proceeded Mr. Chief Justice to sentence on a substantive charge and he gave a sentence for prison breach of 10 years which was the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.655" offset="878007">Five years minimum, 10 years maximum which was the maximum permitted by the statutes of Pennsylvania for prison breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.059" offset="923564">He then imposed a sentence of 30 years maximum, 15 years minimum for the charge of holding hostage.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.409" offset="953031">The aggregate of all of that was 40 years on the substantive crimes, 22 years for criminal contempt or a net sentence of 62 years with a 31-year minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.868" offset="1002872">That was the sentence imposed that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.607" offset="1017814">I'm told, although, I have not seen the documents itself that a few days later, he reversed the order of sentencing so that the -- although, he started that Monday morning with the criminal contempt sentence and then followed with the substantive crimes but he directed the sentence on a substantive crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.657" offset="1086046">For 40 years, he served first and then the 22 years for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.858" offset="1106840">But the net effect of the sentencing that morning was 22 years for criminal contempt, 40 years for substantive crime, 62 years total.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.533" offset="1153546">I am aware of no criminal contempt sentence which comes even within a long distance of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.605" offset="1189804">There had been many studies made of criminal contempts over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.984" offset="1215300">None of them reflected a sentence that is even one-seventh, who’s great for any kind of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.746" offset="1254379">In that same session, the judge sentenced the two co-defendants also for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.778" offset="1278516">On exactly the same methodology, he had it this per diem method and it was two years for each day on which he found a criminal contempt had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.341" offset="1328776">The sentences on the co-defendants were somewhat shorter, it were six days in the case of one defendant and seven days in the case of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.161" offset="1419995">One of the co-defendants verbally threatened the life of the judge which never happened in the case of petitioner Mayberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.317" offset="1464613">Some of the obstreperous, disruptive conduct on the part of, one of the co-defendants, it seems to me that have been substantially worse from reading the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.533" offset="1509543">The 11 contempts found against the petitioner Mayberry involved nine counts, nine charges of what I have described as purely verbal epithets directed at the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.091" offset="1559698">They were quite brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.694" offset="2974177">If the sentence in this case had been in the tradition of sentences for courtroom in de quorum a few days or a few dollars that happened in, for example, in the Fisher and Pace case, this Court reviewed many years ago, the amount of procedure that we traditionally have required in that kind of a case is rather slight, and indeed if the judge does as in the Fisher case impose or threaten to impose the sanctions during the course of the trial, the procedural requisites follow from the necessary situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.368" offset="3128822">In this case, we have an obviously much different situation of a very serious crime in the mind of the judge and it seems to me the nature of the penalty quite reinforces the total absence of any process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.538" offset="8929573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.115" offset="8943783">We were originally of the opinion that the entire trial transcript should be printed in the appendix for the Court because we felt that only by reading the entire trial transcript could this Court get some idea of the feelings, and the tensions, and the pressures that existed throughout this long five week trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.339" offset="9016717">Unfortunately, going through the trial transcript we realized that by the court's stenographer merely really taking down the words that happened that so much missed the Court’s stenographer or could not be taken down simply in the method of words that this Court could not feel simply from a cold record, the tensions, and the pressures that existed that day or the response that the petitioner was able to evoke, not only from his co-defendants or from the jury, but from the spectators who were in the courtroom at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.297" offset="9152554">Apparently, it seems to me that the petitioner might be able to take advantage of this cold record in denying, first of all, that he is an extremely intelligent and articulate man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.145" offset="9195917">And secondly, that he was not the ring leader or the instigator of all of these contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.416" offset="9220995">If I may just for a few moments to recap some of the events of the trial that might not necessarily be printed in the trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.804" offset="9258611">This was the second trial that had begun in these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.124" offset="9271881">The first ended in the mistrial when the petitioner alleged that a prospective juror had seen him handcuffed to a sheriff, a mistrial was granted and the petitioner boasted at this time that he would never be brought to trial in these charges, that if all those failed, he would break out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.146" offset="9343979">He threatened the prosecutor and stated that prosecutor would never see him from the trial in these charges for prison breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.489" offset="9377311">These weren’t idle threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.250" offset="9384417">Mayberry had previously broken out of the Eastern Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, the Western Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, the Graterford prison he attempted a prison breach and during the course of this trial, he was able to break out at the Allegany County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.963" offset="9455261">This prison breach occurred almost in the middle of this particular trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.996" offset="9479398">At the time it occurred on a weekend, the petitioner and his two co-defendants as well as three other inmates of the Allegany County Jail broke out, kidnapped the city police officer, who was on duty at that time and were able to get a good distance from the city before they were captured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.561" offset="9549615">It was only because the gun that they had secured from the police officer misfired that a police officer was not killed at close range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.191" offset="9588172">As I say, this occurred during the course of a trial and does not necessarily appear as the matter of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.092" offset="9607711">But in any event, petitioner from the start was deemed to be a very dangerous individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.593" offset="9629759">The courtroom, understandably contained the great number of sheriff’s deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.579" offset="9653687">Trial began before Judge Fiok and Mayberry as has been set forth before decided that he wanted to act as his own counsel and refused the help of counsel that was appointed for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.918" offset="9703006">Counsel, nonetheless appeared throughout the trial and was there at the sentencing for the contempt citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.217" offset="9732263">Mayberry requested from the trial judge that he permitted to come to sidebar, whenever he wished, the trial judge refused this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.335" offset="9764760">First of all, I believe that because Mayberry was a very dangerous individual and a search of Mayberry’s legal papers during the trial revealed that he had placed sharpened razor blades inside of his legal pad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.807" offset="9830588">Secondly, one of the co-defendants had been throwing pencils at the judge, during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.550" offset="9849605">So I mean, there’s a certainly reasonable grounds to believe that the judge himself might have feared that his life was in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.457" offset="9881161">There was a bodyguard especially assigned to the prosecutor after the threats and the petitioner became so numerous across the counsel table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.771" offset="9910418">These again are not recorded in the trial transcript because the court stenographer was not within the hearing range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.767" offset="9938422">Nonetheless, the request for sidebar was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.480" offset="9957334">Mayberry started a series of taunts to the judge which continued throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.605" offset="9985755">His attitude was this, “I want an explanation that satisfies me right now and if I don’t get it, I'm not going to continue with this trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.198" offset="10028178">For example, a very good example I think occurs at the end of trial when he closes to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.785" offset="10050539">He is told that he will only be permitted an hour to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.101" offset="10063809">The end of the hour, he is given an additional 15 minutes, Mayberry decides that he wants just to continue his closing to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.656" offset="10101948">When he refuses to hear the judge’s warnings, he is taken out of the courtroom and another co-defendant is permitted to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.902" offset="10130996">When Mayberry is brought back in again, he gets off and starts closing to the jury again, he’s again taken out of the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.958" offset="10159208">So that the trial judge attempted on several occasions, various different methods, he had him taken out of the room at least 10 or 11 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.380" offset="10208841">When brought back, Mayberry proceeded the same way as when he had left off, when he was taken out of the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.205" offset="10232142">He was bound and gagged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.785" offset="10238516">But unfortunately, he was able to shout through the gag and pound on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.008" offset="10259414">His shoes and the shoes of his co-defendants were removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.641" offset="10269968">He still raised such a ruckus that the trial judge was unable to charge to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.845" offset="10294732">Now, when Mayberry would direct one of his assaults to the trial judge, petitioner’s brief would have you believed that nothing merely happen except the judge said, “Continue on with your questioning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.433" offset="10341125">What happened precisely was this, Mayberry was greatly amused by the fact that there were loud gossips in the courtroom that the jury was shocked that some of the spectators were shocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.888" offset="10386892">He would burst out into this loud laughter which was followed by his co-defendant, who would hoot and howl, and applaud, and stamp their feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.868" offset="10426807">And in fact, the reason we say that Mayberry was the ring leader here was that when he would return to his seat, he would lean across to the prosecutor and say, “Now, watch this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.050" offset="10467558">And would stand up and repeat something.</text>
