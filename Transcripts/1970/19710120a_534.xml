            <text syncTime="53.858" offset="318777">I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.157" offset="327973">I just looked at it within the 15 minutes and thought I had carefully verified this citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.971" offset="367261">The legal issue in this case is much like that in the preceding case except that the question arises under a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.256" offset="412400">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.542" offset="425566">It comes here on direct appeal from the singe-judge District Court for the Central to California which dismissed the indictment on the ground of the statute under which it was brought is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.301" offset="500590">The statutory provision here involved is Section 1461 of Title 18 of the United States Code which is set forth on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.118" offset="571852">This makes guilty of a crime any person who knowingly uses the mail for sending non mailable matter and that term is defined to include every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.426" offset="669027">The indictment charges a violation of Section 1461 in three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.157" offset="699956">Although the appendix contains some other material, particularly the text of an affidavit for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.831" offset="738722">I believe that the only matters that are before the Court are these three counts of the indictment, very brief paragraphs and a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.834" offset="798699">This motion was filed on the ground that Section 1461 is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.269" offset="848436">The government stipulated that the booklet which was the subject of count three had been ordered by a postal inspector who was an adult and that it had no evidence that the other two booklets had not been solicited by adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.535" offset="925550">The court then indicated that this stipulation would be regarded as having been made as an amendment to the indictment in response to a Bill of Particulars to which counsel on both sides concurred and we believe that that brings the situation within this Court's Fruehauf decision in 365 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.538" offset="1037563">The court then dismissed the indictment, relying on Stanley against Georgia which it interpreted as establishing a right to receive obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.478" offset="1097331">The court found that a necessary consequence of Stanley, that individuals cannot be restricted from distributing obscene material commercially through the mails to adults who solicit such material.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.945" offset="1163160">Despite the express disavow in Stanley of any intent to impair the holding in Roth against the United States which sustained a conviction under the very statute involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.894" offset="1226898">The court dismissed the indictment as applied in this particular prosecution and this direct appeal followed under the Criminal Appeals Act as it the stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.686" offset="1290115">This case involves the power of Congress to prohibit use of the mails for commercial distribution of obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.236" offset="1332328">Under the Constitution, Congress is given power to established post offices and post roads and also to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.903" offset="1398993">This Court has consistently upheld the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.002" offset="1419368">Acting under these powers to enact measures designed in the judgment of Congress to promote the public health morals and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.503" offset="1469419">It is nearly a hundred years since this Court upheld the validity of the statute which prohibited the sending of lottery tickets through the mails and in doing so the court like in that statute to the one then in effect, which prohibited the mailing of obscene matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.794" offset="1566595">Only 15 years ago in the Roth case, this Court held constitutional, the very statute which is challenged here, Section 1461 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.431" offset="1629080">Indeed the factual situation in the Roth case is extremely close to that involved here as two of the items in Roth had been mailed in response to an order from a postal inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.892" offset="1694908">Nothing has happened since the Roth case to warrant the conclusion that this exercise of the postal power by Congress is no longer proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.138" offset="1743914">Indeed in the Stanley case, decided less than two years ago, the Court said, "Roth and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today's holding."</text>
            <text syncTime="427.585" offset="1813713">Despite this clear statement in Stanley the Court below held that the result of Stanley was that an exception had been made to Roth so that Section 1461 is unconstitutional as applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.503" offset="1881422">It held that Stanley established the right to receive from which it concluded that there must be a right to send as long as the material was solicited by adults and not directed to children or to an unwilling public.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.274" offset="1960417">That's in the appendix of page 13 in the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.195" offset="1992182">Our argument on this question is the same as that already submitted in the case of the 37 Photographs in which the argument has just been concluded and in our brief and argument as amicus curiae in Byrne against Karalexis, number 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.371" offset="2084864">This case has nothing to do with an invasion of a man's privacy in his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.982" offset="2127287">The defendant did not have these materials for his own edification.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.985" offset="2155290">He is not charged with having them.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.404" offset="2168978">He is charged with mailing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.403" offset="2184965">He had them for a commercial purpose and it is not denied that he deposited them in the mails.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="527.284" stopTime="530.399">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="527.284" offset="2212551">Did the statute dealt in terms of commercial distribution?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="530.399" stopTime="1097.137">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="530.399" offset="2224985">No Mr. Justice I think it would not make any difference whether it was commercial or private.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.410" offset="2257063">It is the policy of the Department of Justice not to persecute in cases where there is purely private transmission of matter which might be regarded as obscene as in that case which was decided in several years ago, where a man took the pictures, sent them to the photographic place for development and they were returned and it is the policy not to persecute in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.576" offset="2381720">Whether that policy is required by any constitutional provision, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.628" offset="2401886">It seems to me to be a reasonable construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.413" offset="2424978">I can imagine situations where though it is private, it is done on a fairly extensive scale let us say from one club to another where the position there taken wouldn't apply and where our argument would be that the statute should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.875" offset="2514840">Stanley, we submit, did not give any special status to obscene material nor any general protection to such material.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.214" offset="2564263">The protection there was given to Stanley and in the privacy of his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.349" offset="2596760">In referring to First Amendment rights, the opinion in Stanley was careful to associate those rights with Mr. Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.685" offset="2638137">There was no suggestion that any First Amendment protection was given to the material itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.722" offset="2670216">Indeed, the specific statement that Roth and the cases following it are not impaired, can have significance, only as recognizing that the materials themselves are not subject to protection and as I mentioned in my argument in the 37 Photographs case this was recognized as recently as last Thursday in this Court's decision in the Mailbox case where the Court referred to the line which separates obscenity from constitutionally protect to the expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.752" offset="2834369">For the purposes of the motion to dismiss in this case, it has been conceded that the materials involved here are indeed obscene and thus under Roth not entitled to the First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.251" offset="2916394">Stanley holds that the state cannot inquire into the contents of a man's library.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.103" offset="2947741">For that inevitably involves supervision of the morality of his own individual thoughts, but this does not require it to condone the distribution of the materials which it legislatively deems inimical to the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.647" offset="3026004">The latter is a judgment which should be left to Congress, as in the case of delusive mails to defraud or for the transportation of lottery tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.145" offset="3087966">Our submission is that Stanley protects Mr. Stanley, but not materials and not purveyors of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.394" offset="3132897">Stanley himself -- itself affirms that it does not impair Roth and the Roth decision clearly requires reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.956" offset="3195173">So far I have argued these cases in what might be called the traditional way, but I would like it add a further word.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.410" offset="3257031">One of the problems in this area is the general lowering of standards, the impairment of public taste which has resulted from an inescapable application of a sort of literary aggressions of law to get shots we must go further and further.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.556" offset="3365595">That off itself would be a matter to work on, but to say that it is required by the Constitution is hard to find in the language of the Constitution and still harder to find in this background history and commonly accepted purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.572" offset="3465697">I suggest that there is not in reality an affinity between Tom Payne, and Sam Adams, and John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and the materials involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.320" offset="3552632">The decisions of the courts do not open up the gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.375" offset="3576874">They give an aura of the legitimacy to the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.489" offset="3597354">It is commonly understood that "I am curious yellow" was approved by the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.076" offset="3635702">The materials involved in this case and others like it are delivered by the United States post office by a man in a blue uniform with the government seal on his shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.651" offset="3694007">It is one thing as far as public standards and taste are concerned to have this traffic going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.107" offset="3723786">It is quite another to have it come with the full sanction and imprimatur of the nation's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.623" offset="3761821">Just last evening, I was reading the current issue of the Saturday review.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.012" offset="3795466">It has an editorial by Norman Cousins, entitled "See everything, do everything, feel nothing."</text>
            <text syncTime="935.880" offset="3846875">He says, one of the busiest through fares in the United States, New York’s 42nd Street, the final step beyond total nudity has now been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.788" offset="3918555">To many it is a travesty that these result has been achieved in the name of the great principle of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.773" offset="3958471">Mr. Cousins go on to observe that defenders of the new trend argue that questions of morality are relative and that any of adult should be allowed to see and do whatever his curiosity or needs demand and he continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.357" offset="4036838">It is a serious error to suppose that the deep personalization of sex is unrelated to other things that are happening to the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.105" offset="4087829">What is most damaging of all is that the process itself obscures what is happening so that our highest responses are being blunted without our knowing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.667" offset="4154075">The First Amendment is one of the great elements in our constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.987" offset="4179362">Like other parts of the Constitution it is not simple in its construction or operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.470" offset="4205275">Like other written text, other problems in the law we will probably keep on searching for its essential meaning and will inevitably proceed by pricking out points and by revising those points through the process of trial and error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.964" offset="4291271">In recent years, we have gone rather far down the road of equating obscenity with freedom of expression in its political and pamphleteering fields with which the founding fathers were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.462" offset="4357204">Perhaps the answer in this difficult area may become clear and more intellectually satisfying if we give up the urge for an absolute construction of the First Amendment and look again at its origin and basically political function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.029" offset="4451453">For these reasons we think that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.180" offset="7228061">The United States may give up the post office when it sees fit, but while it carries on the use of the mail, it is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.051" offset="7267558">Mr. Rosenwein, you were speaking before about a point that I would like to have you clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.153" offset="7292008">If I understood you correctly, you suggested that there were limitations on even First Amendment rights in dealing with ideas, if the presentation was obtrusive?</text>

          <turn speaker="sam_rosenwein" startTime="1810.380" stopTime="1811.429">
            <label>Mr. Sam Rosenwein</label>
            <text syncTime="1810.380" offset="7344880">Right.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1811.429" stopTime="1822.008">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1811.429" offset="7349060">Now where do you find any constitutional limitation to exercise your First Amendments rights in a particular way as distinguished from exercising it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sam_rosenwein" startTime="1822.008" stopTime="2041.870">
            <label>Mr. Sam Rosenwein</label>
            <text syncTime="1822.008" offset="7391378">Well, in generally speaking, in broad terms, there have been so called, imitations of what we call time, place and manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.145" offset="7435995">So for example while you have the right to speak freely and the right to assemble freely, one could not do that at 5 o' clock on the main street when the traffic is going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.355" offset="7472776">Now, in the same fashion, in this area, we have accepted for present purposes that the two compelling considerations that we think the state properly might point to and limiting the distribution of obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.330" offset="7560652">One that it not be distributed to minors, this under a specific statute and they -- we have now in about 35 to 40 states, specific statutes to deal with distribution to minors and the other is obtrusive forcing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.285" offset="7620524">You dealt with that in Rowan to some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.808" offset="7638601">Now, I myself confessed that as far as obtrusiveness and the front is concerned, there will have to be some further thinking in cases as to what that means because obviously I’m not talking of the kind of a front that sometimes comes when we have to listen to speakers we don’t like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.778" offset="7706520">This Court has never held at that justified limitations, but I think I’m talking about a front that virtually invades the privacy of someone that really forces itself upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.143" offset="7751973">That kind of situation, but this is the situation in which the adult citizen is merely asking that he -- can it be -- you -- when Your Honor wrote in Rowan, you pointed out that Congress has permitted citizens to build the wall around their homes so that obtrusive material cannot be forced upon them, Can it be now that the government has a right to put a wall around Mr. Stanley, when Mr. Stanley wants to go out and get a book, he wants to get some explicit material for himself?</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.838" offset="7902751">Can it be that he cannot write and say to someone who has put an ad in the paper, yes I would like to have that material?</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.791" offset="7938487">If our country needs anything, the right of people to choose, I would think that this is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.575" offset="7965654">Certainly, this is perhaps some part of my answer to the Solicitor General, it’s a little different from contemporaneous offense in other parts of the world, in Czechoslovakia or Russia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.261" offset="8016436">This country lets individuals choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.739" offset="8034304">Would you say to a man who’s getting a social security at 65, look here to your money, but don’t spend it for this event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.712" offset="8062203">No, we give the money to the individual and we have confidence that he will use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.774" offset="8086444">The government does not concern itself with what amend choose as to do with his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.359" offset="8108805">Can you say to a man, you can read this or you cannot read this for his own intellectual nourishment and can it be argued that a political speech or as was held in Kingsley, the advocacy of a adultery as a permissible way of life which was held to be constitutionally protecting is alright for a citizen to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.571" offset="8229700">It’s a 100% protected, but the explicit sexual materials which might deal with the very same subject in a little more detail, that citizen cannot read.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2041.870" offset="8270869">Would you agree that the Rowan holding must be read as a having placed limits on the use of the mails in a way that had not been done before?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sam Rosenwein</label>
            <text syncTime="2054.443" offset="8321128">Yes I think that’s – and to some degree that’s true and that congressional decision has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.766" offset="8354461">Now, on the question that congressional action I think of the congressional action is quite appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.880" offset="8386853">We should have congressional action in this area and the reason we should have congressional action in this area is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.501" offset="8413393">Now this 100-year so called venerable statute which is called the Comstock Act and I don’t believe that Mr. Comstock was venerable, not in my opinion, then it would seem to me that in the light of what has happened, it is time for Congress to do what it is doing, begin to go over all of these statutes were obviously overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.858" offset="8518823">The point that we are asking this Court is only to perform a judicial function to declare the statute unconstitutional because it covers consenting adults as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.813" offset="8570650">It covers people who really want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.263" offset="8584443">Congress has indicated that it can act and it has done that, it has done its part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.669" offset="8610043">It has now provided that if an adult and his minors included a rather old minor, but in any event minors included, can even not -- it doesn't have to be subject to even one mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.394" offset="8668975">He can put his name on the list now and get no mailings of sexually oriented material and Congress has provided both civil and penal sanctions for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.330" offset="8716727">So, we have carefully edged out those upon whom material is obtrusively forced ought minus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.832" offset="8750686">What Congress cannot do under the Constitution, we submit, is forbid the mailing of obscene material to an individual, an adult citizen who has requested it and I think that the Court below properly concluded that the indictment should be dismissed because the failure to allege the essential allegations, but again like Mr. Fleishman, I think the Court here might properly say that this Comstock Act is too broad and therefore it cannot stand compatible with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.851" offset="8930826">It is true as the Solicitor General says that two or three decisions that are dealt with Stanley have limited, saying, well it deals only with privacy, but 17 District Judges from California, Massachusetts, Oregon, Minnesota some of the most eminent jurists have read Stanley and have understood in the light of everything that’s gone up to this point and so far as a consenting adult is concerned, he should have his freedom and the man who mails to him should certainly as his steward, as the man who will furnish him this communication to certainly be protected from criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.238" offset="9136358">And I might say if the Court reads those opinions that we have added to our brief, you will find implicit in it, a great sigh of relief from all the judges because we are clogged and our calendars are clogged with cases that really don’t belong there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.877" offset="9218905">And some of the members of the squad maybe too young to remember the probation days, but the fact to the matter is that we are reaching about the same kind of disrespect for the law in those aspects, the enforceability of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.092" offset="9283688">I recall myself coming into the Eastern District in New York and Chief Judge saying well, this is bogging day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.209" offset="9320260">Everybody $10 fine and pharmacists and bootleggers and everybody is marching up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.294" offset="9340531">Shall we return to bootleggers and a First Amendment material, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.832" offset="9366653">Thank you.</text>
