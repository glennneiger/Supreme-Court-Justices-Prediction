            <label>Mr. Lee A. Freeman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.876" offset="222856">This case arises in the midst of several antitrust actions which have been brought on behalf of public schools and libraries and parochial schools seeking damages for an alleged price-fixing conspiracy among numerous publishers and jobbers in the sale of library editions of children's books to institutional schools and libraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.415" offset="317001">This conspiracy is alleged to have lasted from 1959 to 1967 when the defendants entered into a consent decree with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.043" offset="359528">The treble damage proceedings on behalf of the schools and libraries have been pending for approximately three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.939" offset="383143">They are consolidated before Judge Decker in the Northern District of Illinois under Section 1407.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.258" offset="412400">Pursuant to order of court, the plaintiffs initiated extensive discovery efforts taking more than a hundred depositions of various personnel of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.071" offset="463705">These efforts to obtain the evidence and the facts were frustrated by the evasion recalcitrance and further occasion of the witnesses who the plaintiffs sought to depose.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.609" offset="505814">As the District Court found, the witnesses were deliberately evasive, the witnesses exhibit a remarkable lack of memory concerning the critical advance alleged in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.092" offset="555760">There was a great discrepancy between the grand jury testimony of these witnesses and the testimony that they offered at deposition four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.986" offset="599333">There was also a fend ignorance by these witnesses concerning the incriminating correspondence they had either sent or received.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.380" offset="636844">The laps of time between the conclusion of the federal government's proceedings, the grand jury investigation, and the depositions taken in these treble damage actions has obscured the recollection of these witnesses and has prevented in frustrated the plaintiffs from getting the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.828" offset="702673">Part of this delay has been attributable to the defendants since this is the second time that the defendants have sought to mandamus Judge Decker.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.127" offset="735901">The first attempt was denied by the Court of Appeals and certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.985" offset="763277">Faced with this problem, the plaintiffs moved for the production of what has been labeled now debriefing statements which were taken from the grand jury witnesses by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.465" offset="817194">It developed from the testimony of witnesses that the defense counsel had stood outside the door of the grand jury room while the Federal Government was conducting its grand jury investigation and as the witnesses left the grand jury room, defense counsel would take them somewhere else, sit down and either with a tape recorder or stenographer or with handwritten notes would asked the grand jury witnesses what questions have been asked by the grand jury, what answers they had given, what type of evidence they felt that grand jury already possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.395" offset="957001">As the affidavits submitted by the defense counsel show -- this was an effort simply to reconstruct the testimony that had been given by the witnesses called before the grand jury in order to track the grand jury investigation and then advise the corporate client as to what had occurred before the grand jury and how best to meet the evidence that was being developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.550" offset="1053550">Inherently, this effort was not limited to corporate employees or to any other type of employees of a particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.803" offset="1086568">This effort extended over all of the grand jury witnesses whatever grand jury witnesses would consent to sit down with counsel and tell him what had occurred before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.126" offset="1119901">Those statements would take in transcribe by the attorneys and use to advise their corporate clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.387" offset="1148949">Upon the motion, the District Court ordered that the defendants produce these debriefing statements and that if any defendant claim that such statements were privileged either under the attorney personal client privilege, attorney corporate client privilege or under the work product doctrine to set forth the precise circumstances and facts under which these debriefing statements were taken and the basis upon which the privilege was claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.719" offset="1262216">The defendants did submit descriptions and affidavits concerning the nature of these debriefing statements, they appear on our appendix, and none of these affidavits was any claim made that the witness interviewed sought legal advice or that the attorneys rendered legal advice to the witnesses after they left the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.354" offset="1340792">There was no evidence from any of the affidavits filed by defense counsel of any confidential attorney-client relationship between the witnesses interviewed and the defense counsel who conducted the grand jury witness interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.898" offset="1402964">It's conceded, I believe, on this record that these materials were collected in order to advice the corporate clients as to the matters that have occurred before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.459" offset="1449253">On this record, the District Court rejected the assertion that these debriefing statements were protected by the personal attorney-client privilege with one exception where the defense counsel's affidavit had made out a case for assertion of the personal attorney-client privilege, also rejected the assertion of attorney corporate client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.749" offset="1522395">Holding that this privilege only attached to communications made by corporate officials having the authority to seek legal advice and to act upon that advice on behalf for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.237" offset="1568371">District judge further found good cause, substantial need for the production of these documents in overruling the claim or work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.114" offset="1607868">On a writ of mandamus, the Court of Appeals did not disturbed the findings of the District Court with the exceptions that the Court of Appeals held that the attorney corporate client privilege should extend to all debriefing statements taken from employees of whatever rank inside the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.084" offset="1695744">Our first point in this proceeding is that the use of writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.648" offset="1721971">In order and production of the grand jury's statements, the District Court did follow and apply substantial federal precedent already on the books and applied in either jurisdictions with Philadelphia v. Westinghouse, Garrison versus General Motors, Natta v. Hogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.645" offset="1777977">The proposed rules of evidence as the Court of Appeals recognized provided for a control group test precisely identical to that applied by Judge Decker not only that but the law of Illinois in which this Court sits has adopted the control group test.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.779" offset="1854464">Indeed, there was an indication in an opinion by another panel of the Seventh Circuit that this Seventh Circuit itself followed the control group test Rucker v. Wabash Railroad speaks in terms of the privilege not applying due to the fact that the employees were not a sufficient rank to qualify as spokesman for the corporation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.119" offset="1939832">The discovery are simply does not satisfy the pre-requisites for the use of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.117" offset="1955819">There has been charge here that the District Court exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.914" offset="1979016">The most that can be claimed is that the District Court aired in ruling on a significant legal issue within its jurisdiction and we do not believe that the writ of mandamus should not be used by the Court of Appeals to substitute its judgment on the disputed question of law regardless of the fact that it maybe significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.283" offset="2052472">Congress has provided specific circumstances for the review of interlocutory orders and a pretrial discovery ruling is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.606" offset="2089775">The opinion as we cited in (Inaudible) expresses a strong legislative and judicial policy against piecemeal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.724" offset="2122271">There has been no showing on this record that there will be any irreparable harm or any error that cannot be corrected in a normal Courts of Appeal resulting from the production of these debriefings statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.058" offset="2191653">There is no claim that trial strategy has been revealed, there is no claim that the impressions or conclusions of counsel have been turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.821" offset="2222686">Indeed, the District Judge was very careful in weighing the evidence as to each debriefing statement and return to the defendants the only debriefing statement for which it was claimed a work-product protection in terms of impressions of counsel -- conclusions of counsel only in the one instance where the document was substantially the impressions of counsel rather than simply a narration effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.649" offset="2342013">In that one instance, the district judge returned the document to counsel asserting the work product claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.966" offset="2375241">Indeed, this case illustrates the possibility of abuse that flows from piecemeal appeals of interlocutory order since this is the second interlocutory order which has been reviewed and a case has been pending for substantial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.371" offset="2432815">Plaintiffs have been delayed and imputed in the pursuit or discovery by these interruptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.591" offset="2461759">We contend that while mandamus was not appropriate for the Seventh Circuit to employ and we ask that this Court decide that mandamus was not appropriate as a matter of judicial decision supervision that this Court -- the Supreme Court should still undertake to review the substantive issue that is the attorney corporate client -- scope of the attorney corporate client privilege.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee A. Freeman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="615.205" offset="2564159">Well, the Seventh Circuit has created a conflict among the Circuits as a law before the Seventh Circuit ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.474" offset="2589236">The precedent was all moving the same way and now there is confusion created by the Seventh Circuit's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.661" offset="2617971">I don't think that confusion could be raise by a decision of mandamus was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.122" offset="2643884">There will still be the pronouncement of accord in West Reporter that they take that view of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.945" offset="2667186">Moreover, the proposed rules of evidence that are been now drafted considered this very point -- the scope of the attorney corporate client privilege and we believe it's more appropriate for that issue to be decided and litigated context rather than passed on -- in this Court's supervisory role when it reviews these rules and submits them to Congress for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.681" offset="2778049">Of course we feel that we're supported by these rules and so proposed draft has come out in our favor and has adopted to control group test as applied by Judge Decker.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.951" offset="2819218">In short, we feel that this case in the Seventh Circuit in the context that it was presented to the Seventh Circuit did not present a sufficiently exceptional circumstance to warrant the use of the writ of the mandamus.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.529" offset="2917439">In Will, there was no opportunity for the Government to secure review of the ruling that they sought to review by the writ of the mandamus.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.568" offset="3773628">No, I don't think that there is a distinction in terms of the application of privileges as there was no distinction in U.S. v. White with respect to the coverage or the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.541" offset="3821484">I believe as Justice Murphy held, you have to look at the purpose of the organization and whether it be a labor union or trade association or a partnership if that purpose is so associate with an individual's purpose, then it would be protected, whereas if it is a collective purpose or a business purpose, it would not be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.494" offset="3897344">We feel that the control group test as applied by the District Court strikes an appropriate balance for the need for discovery by litigants and the rational for the attorney-client privilege of rational agenda lays a traditional attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.948" offset="3955127">I believe all commentators recognized that the privilege results in a suppression of information and needs to be confine within the narrowest possible limits consistently its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.524" offset="3993475">A consistence with its purpose, the control group test recognizes the privilege with respect to communications to counsel for the purpose of securing legal advice by those corporate officials having the authority to direct the corporate action taken on that advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.259" offset="4056377">The function of the privilege is to protect counsel -- to permit counsel to give advice to the client and for the client to act upon that advice and we believe that logically that provision only extend to corporate officials who respond to the attorney's function as an attorney, the person who acts on the advice is therefore protected in his communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.456" offset="4153240">The control group people -- those people who can act on the attorney's advice are really the only people who occupy a confidential relationship with the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.332" offset="4188662">They are the people who seek the advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.844" offset="4194722">They are the people who implement the advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.371" offset="4204857">The respondents have argued that it is very important for the counsel to give adequate legal advice to secure all of the facts and I believe this relates to your question Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.116" offset="4255848">But we do not believe that the need to secure the facts constitute a rational to apply the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.820" offset="4278627">In this instance, it may be far more important for counsel for Harper and Row to secure the facts from the witnesses who have testified from wholesalers as to the enforcement and maintenance of this price conspiracy than to interview their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.244" offset="4348322">There may be far more damaging that evidence developed before the grand jury from other witnesses than from the corporate employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.231" offset="4376325">We would distinguish sharply then the distinction -- the fact-gathering function of an attorney from the function of giving legal advice and we believe that it is only that function of giving legal advice which authorizes the privilege to apply that communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.405" offset="8421021">I have to devote a few moment to a discussion of what the origin and nature of the privilege is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.716" offset="8446203">Of course, the attorney-client privilege is not a rigid and flexible rule of evidence or of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.688" offset="8470131">It's a rule founded upon justice and reason which has accommodated itself and must continue to accommodate itself to changing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.787" offset="8506493">When it was first to enunciated, so about 300 years ago, it was a privilege available only to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.047" offset="8535542">As early as 1801 however, it was stated by Lord Eldon to be the privilege of the client and the public and so it's been come to be regarded ever since a privilege protecting not only the interest of the client but the interest of the public as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.640" offset="8613909">Originally, it was a privilege limited to pending litigation then to contemplated litigation then to other litigation and as it accommodated itself to expanding conditions it finally became a protection to legal advice without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.415" offset="8693008">Now, originally, it was directed toward communications between an attorney and an individual client and the reason is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.000" offset="8727385">In the 16th and 17th centuries, there was very little but individual clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.321" offset="8752671">Again, it has accommodated itself in this respect to a changing world and it has become increasingly directed toward the protection of confidential information between an attorney and a corporate client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.448" offset="8817142">I think the reason for this recent direction becomes clear when consideration is given to the question of just what the purpose of the privilege is and just how that purpose can be best accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.435" offset="8877119">The purpose I would judge is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.248" offset="8888404">It is universally accepted not only in this country but in all other countries of the civilized world of whose judicial systems I have any knowledge that it is in the interest of the public, that every person whether an individual, an association, or a corporation should be encouraged to seek professional advice in the guidance of its affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.578" offset="8997700">That with a benefit of such advice, he will be more up to conform his conduct whether a personal or corporate to the standards imposed by society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.050" offset="9043571">I think it's further generally accepted that in order to accomplish this subjective communications between a attorney and client, whether verbal or in writing, must be free and uninhibited for human nature being what it is, what it has always has been and what I suppose it always will be depending the coming of the millennium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.969" offset="9131238">The ordinary individual seeking legal advice or providing information upon which legal advice will be predicated either for him or for his or for a corporate employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.999" offset="9191320">He will be more willing to speak freely knowing that the attorney cannot be required to become an informer against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.884" offset="9234892">If he knows that he is protected by the attorney-client privilege and the communication must be held in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.471" offset="9273240">Today, as everyone knows the corporations are exhuming and ever expanding role in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.862" offset="9314826">Today, a corporation is supposed to do more than provide a good product and profits for its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.853" offset="9342830">It's supposed to have an interest in the protection of the environment and the protection of civil rights and in other matters that are important to common welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.250" offset="9384417">It certainly, is no less important that a corporation been formed its actions which have greater rate today than the actions of individuals to the laws of the land and then the best interest of society then that the individual do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.878" offset="9454843">Now, this general acceptance of this proposition is well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.868" offset="9478875">To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Freeman, Sr. is the only person who has ever sought to contest the propriety of the application of the attorney-client privilege to a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.354" offset="9536763">He did that in 1962 and we happen to be on opposite sides of the table of that time as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.802" offset="9562572">His effort however met short shrift at that the hands of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the case American Gas -- Radiant Burners versus American Gas Association certiorari denied by this Court in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.830" offset="9626728">Today, counsel concedes though, I think it is with obvious reluctance, that there has to be an attorney or at least not has to be, I overstate, that there is an attorney-client privilege of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.557" offset="9685556">But they would render it wholly important with the restriction which has suggested namely that an attorney be permitted to communicate in confidence with only a miniscule number of persons in any corporation forming what is described as the control group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.223" offset="9768312">Counsel argues that to go further would constitute an extension of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.254" offset="9792345">He relies basically on the decision of Judge Kirkpatrick and the case of City of Philadelphia versus Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.327" offset="9820662">However, nothing could be further from the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.233" offset="9836335">The control group test when enunciated by Judge Kirkpatrick in 1963, sprung full-blown from his own draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.233" offset="9872280">Prior to that date, it was known to neither man nor court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.877" offset="9886908">On the contrary, the rule as advocated by the respondents here, have been consistently applied prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.686" offset="9926092">I think it is important that neither Judge Kirkpatrick nor any of the limited number of courts which have followed him nor counsel here have given any rationalization of the application of the control group test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.532" offset="10009475">I think you will find that every argument that has been made to date is an argument against the propriety of the attorney-client privilege itself rather than a limitation of its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.006" offset="10075408">In none of the cases cited by petitioners was any analysis made of the results which could be expected to flow from the adoption of those test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.435" offset="10125145">The question is to whether or not it would affect the giving of professional advice and the interest of the public in making sure that that advice was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.109" offset="10163806">Furthermore, none of the cases following the Kirkpatrick decision was the validity of the control group test even a contested issue with the possible exception of a day case in Illinois where the court opinion doesn't make the position of the parties entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.190" offset="10240084">The question and each of these cases was merely whether assuming the validity of the control group test, it could properly be applied to the communications which were there under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.808" offset="10290552">It would appear to me that Judge Kirkpatrick's opinion appears to have resulted from the giving of an undue emphasis to the giving of advice as oppose or rather than the obtaining of information and the feeling that advice need be given only to the limited group dictating policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.647" offset="10385951">The likelihood that a limited group of people may dictate over all policy in a corporation is -- I can see to be of no significance as far as the interest of the public in having every employee through whom a corporation acts and with full knowledge of the law and the consequences of its own action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.691" offset="10490128">Now, the control group test would make it impossible not only to receive information from the employee, but to give advice to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.110" offset="10535790">This is directly contrary to the law as it has been known and I think perhaps at this juncture I might answer the question of Mr. Justice White asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.619" offset="10585840">This is what Dean Wigmore has to say with respect to the availability of the privilege to an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.701" offset="10618128">He says, “This of course includes communications through an interpreter and also communications through a messenger or any other agent of transmission as well as communications originating with the client, agents it made to the attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.284" offset="10692524">As far as I know, no one has here before ever taken the position that there was any distinction between the agent of a sole proprietor or a partnership and the agent of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.954" offset="10751143">The -- it is inconceivable to me that in the interest of the public, there could be any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.468" offset="10785207">If it is in the interest of the public that every person in a -- that every person act with full knowledge of the consequences of its action, then why should the protection of the privilege be limited only to a very small number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.479" offset="10857305">Why should it be denied to the person who made the most in need of the advice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.406" offset="10884995">Now, you may say that, maybe you argued that if you give the advice to a president, it ultimately filters down through challenge of communication and ultimately gets in some form to the person not on the firing line who needs the -- really needs the information to conform his action and the actions of persons whose action he is directing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.291" offset="10968586">But if the advice is to -- if the privileges of value and the advices of value, then the advice should be available in the form in which it is most effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.126" offset="11027832">And I do not see how anyone could argue that advice given to the president of a company has more to do with the action taken by sales manager who was in charge of a sales group than the advice given directly to the sales manager where he can ask questions or he can an get interpretation where he really knows what the significance of the advice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.145" offset="11127933">If the attorney-client privilege has any value, it has value on an ever expanding and broader scale and not on an ever limiting and small scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.060" offset="11187597">If the information given to an attorney is obtained by an employee in the course of and as a result of his employment, I can see no legal, logical or practical reason why the position occupied by the employee or the extent of his ability to dictate the use to be made of a resulting opinion should be a matter of any importance or should be a matter of significance as far as the public interest is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.008" offset="11319359">If it is well informed the advice that a person should have then that advice should be obtained from the source where it is best and most accurately available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.627" offset="11369932">I think it's apparent that the president of a large company very rarely knows the details of the day-to-day operations of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.546" offset="11401592">This is information that you ordinarily would have to collect from my number of broadly based sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.997" offset="11423326">The salesman or the sales manager may best know whether or not there are pricing practices which may be suspect under the Robinson-Patman Act whether those prices may be justified on the basis of meeting of competition or something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.535" offset="14245491">I will state about five things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.089" offset="14251760">I think that the importance of the question is made clear as indicated by the interests of the attorneys throughout the country in the various bar associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.303" offset="14296586">There was no other effective remedy that was available in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.659" offset="14326053">The court below not only refuse to certify but refuse to return the impounded documents so that had respondents chose him to, they could've refuse to produce them and gone up under contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.465" offset="14381223">Obviously, a -- that is obviously a ruling after the documents were released would not be an adequate remedy the information is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.299" offset="14432528">If even more importance to me, failure to review the order of the trial court would have left unresolved in the event of a verdict for the defendants or a settlement an issue which was stated by the Court of Appeals to have substantial importance to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.755" offset="14502431">I think also particularly compelling as the fact that the Court of Appeals in Radiant Burners in 1963 cited with approval the decisions of Judges Leahy and Wyzanski and the Zenith Radio and United Shoe Machinery cases stating that in those cases, the problem posed “where a corporation must act through its officers and employees was competently met.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.725" offset="14614235">In both of those decisions, the privilege was held to protect communications between an attorney and employees of a corporation who were not claimed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.595" offset="14653733">And in fact, obviously were not members of a control group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.147" offset="14671914">An appellate court generally has it within its power to grant mandamus and exceptional situations and I would say that assuredly that power exist for its exercise for the purpose of compelling a lower court to adhere the principles which the appellate court has enunciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.781" offset="14738474">I see the warning sign and in closing, may I say that I consider this to be as an important argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.528" offset="14769507">It has ever been my privilege to make and I only trust -- I have adequately presented the position of the many attorneys who through their bar associations and have shown their concern and the resolution of an issue which in their opinion will have a very serious barring upon their ability to serve the best interests of their clients and of society.</text>

            <text syncTime="3696.946" offset="14891133">To touch briefly on a few points, we submit that it is not possible as defendants wish to mechanically apply the individual attorney privilege to the corporate context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.307" offset="14936586">This Court has already drawn a distinction between individuals and corporations for purposes of their privilege against self-incrimination and to decide the scope of the attorney corporate-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.010" offset="14975457">We must look at the purpose of the privilege and if the purpose of the privilege is to encourage frank discloser to the attorneys that purpose is not fulfilled by applying the privilege to subsidiary or lower issue line employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.036" offset="15027493">The privilege is not necessary to secure reports from these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.218" offset="15044211">In this situation, the attorney stands in no different posture than any ordinary corporate executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.191" offset="15068139">If the employee is asked to submit a report, he will submit a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.240" offset="15092381">The fear that corporations will stop employing attorneys or the attorneys will not properly prepare their cases for corporate client is also a relatively remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.563" offset="15129579">This rule has been in effect to control group rule in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.723" offset="15154239">It has been applied throughout the electrical conspiracy cases by Judge Kirkpatrick, Judge Ryan, and Judge Christiansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.301" offset="15176600">It was applied by Judge Fullam in the Philadelphia Electric versus Anaconda Brass case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.980" offset="15199274">In that case, Judge Fullam held there was no privilege but refused to disclose the debriefing statements because he found there was no good cause for their discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.760" offset="15230412">Indeed, all of the arguments which have been raised by the defendants in support of the privilege are really arguments which go to good cause and they were arguments which were answered by Hickman v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.938" offset="15275133">The idea that an attorney will be a witness against his client, the idea that an attorney will be a source of information for his adversary, the idea that discovery of work product will reward the slothful attorney and penalizing industrious attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.785" offset="15330513">It hasn't happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.677" offset="15334066">It hasn't occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.059" offset="15339604">Courts require quite a substantial showing of need before they open opposing counsel's files to their adversaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.646" offset="15369906">And I think that is sufficient protection to all of the fears which the defendants imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.092" offset="15391744">It really boils down to a balancing of interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.746" offset="15406373">We submit that contrary to respondents -- defendants' representation the material is not otherwise available to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.914" offset="15439078">We must look at the contents of these debriefing statements to determining what kind of material is being suppressed and what justification there is for applying the privilege to all employees when there are such strong reasons for securing this information to make a proper resolution of judicial controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.880" offset="15506892">Thank you.</text>
