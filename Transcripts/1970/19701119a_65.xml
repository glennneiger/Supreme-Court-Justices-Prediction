            <text syncTime="42.940" offset="275101">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.656" offset="281997">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.411" offset="297044">This case involves two issues relating to administrative summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.711" offset="322226">The first issue concerns the right of intervention in summonses enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.015" offset="351483">Intervention under Rule 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an intervention under this Court?s 1964 decision in Reisman versus Caplin.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.674" offset="406026">The second issue relates to the use of administrative summonses in criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.812" offset="438627">Petitioner moved to intervene in an enforcement proceeding in the District Court and was denied intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.080" offset="471646">There was no evidentiary hearing and there has been no written opinion by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.004" offset="495365">However, the court below when it considered petitioner?s intervention, determined that intervention should be governed solely by this Court?s decision in Reisman versus Caplin.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.355" offset="544789">And the Fifth Circuit narrowly construed the Reisman decision to require that a proprietary interest or a privilege relationship be established by the proposed intervener before he should be allowed to intervene in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.893" offset="614902">Secondly, the Fifth Circuit held that the intervener must show that if he would be allowed to intervene, he could successfully defend in the summonses enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.765" offset="666415">The Court of Appeals found that petitioner had not met their requirements and therefore denied intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.861" offset="698807">I believe that the facts in this case are basically undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.801" offset="718555">In 1968, the Internal Revenue Service began conducting an investigation of Mr. Donaldson concerning his alleged failure to file federal income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.652" offset="773935">In connection with this investigation, special agents of the Internal Revenue Service issued administrative summonses to various third parties with whom Mr. Donaldson had transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.265" offset="824404">The respondents in this action, Acme Circus Operating Company Inc. and its accountant Joseph J. Mercurio were such third party witnesses to receive summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.078" offset="875708">Acme and Mercurio are not active parties in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.435" offset="905070">In September of 1968, when Donaldson learned that a special agent had inquired at the Acme Circus Company and requested certain information and certain documents, Acme informed Mr. Donaldson that they would comply with any request made by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.693" offset="986154">But Donaldson believing that the procedures being used to investigate him were not proper and sought to prevent involuntary compliance by the Acme Circus.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.827" offset="1030666">Following the guidelines set down by this Court in the Reisman case, Mr. Donaldson petitioned the District Court for a temporary restraining order enjoining this third party, Acme Circus from complying with any request through summonses by the Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.577" offset="1097644">The District Court granted the temporary restraining order and the third parties were then restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.653" offset="1121991">About seven weeks later the United States then commenced an independent action on petition and order to show a cause to enforce the administrative summonses that had been issued to the Acme Circus.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.140" offset="1175907">The summonses required that Acme and Mercurio furnish information concerning their financial dealings with the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.882" offset="1206941">In the Government?s petition, it alleged that these summonses issued by the special agent were to obtain information necessary for a determination of Donaldson?s correct tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.258" offset="1268381">Donaldson was not named a party to the summonses enforcement action and therefore moved to intervene under Rule 24 (a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, intervention of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.671" offset="1318013">Donaldson alleged that he had an interest in this action and he would be bound by the decision of this action and that he was not adequately represented by the existing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.790" offset="1362526">He also filed proposed answers in which he alleged that the purpose for which the special agent had issued these summonses was not in fact determination of correct tax liability but rather to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.842" offset="1430758">Donaldson also alleged that Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code, the statute under which these summonses is issued, did not authorize the use of the summonses for criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.360" offset="1492825">As we have mentioned, there was no evidentiary hearing, the court simply denied intervention and the case comes before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.451" offset="1537128">And we believe that the courts below have erred in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.558" offset="1553638">First, we believe that under Rule 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Donaldson had an interest which was not adequately represented or protected, and therefore, he should have been allowed to intervene under Rule 24 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="378.786" offset="1618526">Secondly, this Court in its decision of Reisman versus Caplin, specifically approved taxpayer intervention in third party summonses enforcement proceedings in order to allow the taxpayer an opportunity to challenge and improper use of a Section 7602 summonses, and therefore, under the Reisman case, Donaldson was also a proper party to the enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.044" offset="1719568">Finally, Section 7602, the Section of Internal Revenue Code under which this summonses is issued, does not authorize the use of an administrative summonses to conduct criminal investigations and therefore Donaldson would've had a proper defense had he been allowed into the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.542" offset="1865540">I believe that to determine the merits of a defense prior to allowing an individual to litigate his defense would be premature.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.017" offset="1943489">Your Honor, the way this case came up, we had filed our petition for a certiorari on the intervention question.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.981" offset="1971284">The court below, the Fifth Circuit had denied intervention because we could not have won even if we were allowed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.506" offset="1997406">And at the suggestion of the Solicitor General, both the defense and the court itself has now raised as well as the intervention question.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.455" offset="2033142">It's very difficult in this case to adequately discuss the defenses that could've been raised since we have no record, there is no evidentiary hearing, there?s no testimony whatsoever and we prepared our brief, we did it in an objective manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.390" offset="2156962">On whether the administrative summonses can be used when there's a criminal prosecution in the background?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Meldman</label>
            <text syncTime="519.384" offset="2180890">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.534" offset="2185488">As a practical matter or possibly, what we?re trying to say is true, if the Court does not reach the second issue intervention, maybe meaningless back in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.302" offset="2228537">However, I think there are other cases pending that this Court may review that to -- maybe better vehicles for decision on the improper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.922" offset="2291022">As I was saying, we believe there's a number of ways we can reach the intervention question.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.385" offset="2312861">The first would be under Rule 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.610" offset="2337834">Under that rule where an individual claims an interest in the subject matter, disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.552" offset="2385586">And the existing party does not adequately represented his interest, he is to be allowed to intervene in a proceeding in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.416" offset="2417037">Now, recently Rule 24 (a) was amended so as to eliminate two requirements that previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.546" offset="2445563">First, that the movement be bound by a decree in that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.551" offset="2461550">And secondly, that he have either a legal or equitable claim in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.977" offset="2483284">I believe under Rule 24 (a) (2) as its now amended, this taxpayer meets the tests of the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.898" offset="2510973">The subject to the Internal Revenue investigation is the taxpayer?s affairs, a matter I think in which every taxpayer has both the legitimate and substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.625" offset="2549844">This interest would clearly be impaired if improper investigative procedures are utilized to go about making an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.810" offset="2582653">And finally, I think it?s clear even on the limited record we have here that the third parties who were participants in the District Court action had no interest in defending any of Mr. Donaldson?s rights nor challenging the summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.632" offset="2641899">They were willing to comply with whatever the court ruled, both in the District Court, Court of Appeals and it assumed from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.649" offset="2673977">I think in the context of this test, they limit intervention where a taxpayer has a proprietary interest or a privilege relationship in the summonses material would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.557" offset="2717550">Donaldson is protesting the procedures being used to investigate him and not the ownership of the documents that are sought by the Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.761" offset="2754435">In this case, we really only have two interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.478" offset="2769272">We have Donaldson on the one hand who has attempted to prevent disclosure of information through improper procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.006" offset="2799365">The United States on the other hand, was trying to require disclosure of information under what they claim are proper procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.866" offset="2826846">The third party who was the litigant in the District Court really has no interest in which side wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.608" offset="2853804">The second test I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="868.432" offset="3577083">If the Court will recall in the Reisman case, a special agent had issued a summonses to a taxpayer?s accountant for a work papers and some documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.433" offset="3617102">The taxpayer?s attorney brought an injunctive action against both the accountant and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.104" offset="3655764">Going to the District Court -- Court of Appeals? level, each level had a different theory for denying taxpayer the right to restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.568" offset="3685648">When it came before this Court, this Court simply said that what they're asking for is equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.961" offset="3707173">There's an adequate remedy at law, therefore, we dismissed the suit against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.096" offset="3731728">However, the Court went further and I believe that the Court could have stopped at that point had they not wanted to examine the entire procedures under which summonses are issued in Internal Revenue investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.557" offset="3781569">And it's our believe and the Court of Appeals for the third the -- in the Sixth Circuit agree with us that upon this examination, the Court found that the proper procedure to be used would be for a taxpayer to intervene in an enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.498" offset="3849383">Now, the Court went on there and said, ?Should you have a willing third party such as Peat Marwick, the accountant in the Reisman, obviously the taxpayer wouldn?t have no opportunity to raise any defenses if they voluntarily turn the records over.?</text>
            <text syncTime="950.634" offset="3905912">So the Court suggested the procedure to be followed in a situation like that, was to restrain that third party and thereby triggering an enforcement proceeding into which the taxpayer could then intervene and have a -- have an adversary hearing and this is a procedure that we?ve attempted to follow in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.154" offset="4499937">We base this on the fact that this is where the Internal Revenue Service has separated its civil and criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.032" offset="4531493">For example in 1968, they made a public announcement that the purposes of the special agent were to investigate criminal tax fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.195" offset="4572139">That henceforth this special agent must issue Miranda warnings to the taxpayer upon his contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.736" offset="4602337">Thirdly, their internal regulations separate the functions at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.120" offset="4619891">They say that all civil aspects of this case must stop when a special agent enters the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.333" offset="4648730">For this reason, this is where we believe that the line should be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.664" offset="4662000">We might -- may point out to the Court that in the past few months, the Internal Revenue Service has now turned to using regular search warrants by their special agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.840" offset="4730755">In a sense this is all new, special agents have been used for years and years and years and these arguments had never appeared before?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Meldman</label>
            <text syncTime="1165.344" offset="4764714">Your Honor, I believe that, as we have pointed out in our brief at page 29 in the green cover, the regulations that govern the functions of the special agents change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.220" offset="4828244">The case most prominently cited by the courts is Boren versus Tucker saying that there really is no distinction and the regulations existing in 1956 give a very at best grey area between their functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.513" offset="4885400">However, the regulations were changed in 1966 and now under the regulations, the special agent has but one function, to investigate criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.272" offset="4924479">He is not responsible in any manner for either civil penalties or civil tax or civil determinations of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.654" offset="4953945">And we have made a comparison at page 29 of our brief of the two regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.018" offset="4971395">I think this is a critical difference that has come about as you say within the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.409" offset="5028968">I might also point out to the Court in this connection that there is a specific section of the Internal Revenue Code, Sections 7608 that authorizes the special agents to use a search warrant and he need not go outside of the scope of the Internal Revenue Code to find this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.588" offset="5105768">Now, we believe that an examination of the history of Section 7602 and the purposes for which it was issued makes it clear that this was meant to aid the Internal Revenue in determining correct tax liability, not to allow the Internal Revenue Service to conduct criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.514" offset="5205452">There maybe instances during the pendency of a criminal case where a tax liability may be unnecessary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.220" offset="5236276">However, we wish to the -- point out to the court that, for example in this case, where the investigation is for alleged failure to file that there is no need for a civil tax liability to be determined and we don?t feel that this is truly the function that the special agent here is meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.937" offset="5315166">The second alternative they?ve suggested, by the Solicitor General would be a suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.004" offset="5339408">He said, ?This maybe an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.467" offset="5349230">Allow the summonses to be enforced and then if and when there is a criminal prosecution, the taxpayer could then bring a suppression action.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.200" offset="5392175">I would like to point out two things to the Court on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.271" offset="5404505">First, I think suppression is a very drastic remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.072" offset="5415685">By its very nature can be employed only limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.497" offset="5437315">The issuance of the summonses if it?s invalidly issued, I don?t think it would be proper under a Section ? a Rule 41 (e) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.511" offset="5469393">If it was issued for an improper purpose, this too may not be a proper 41 (3) motion for suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.784" offset="5494471">Secondly, we believe had this Court believed that the proper procedure to be followed was suppression that it could've done away with the entire scope of the Reisman opinion, simply denied that taxpayer of relief and stopped and said that any time a summonses is issued for any purpose whatsoever, let the summonses be complied with and let suppression be the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.256" offset="5588407">However, I think it's a very impractical test to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.076" offset="5603662">Many times as the Court well knows when you get to the suppression, evidence has been commingled and there's no way to marshal one from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.841" offset="5634696">I think if the Court determines and sets down a specific point in time when this summonses can no longer be used that the controversy that?s going on throughout the country will come to an immediate stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.659" offset="5678059">And we will have no longer a problem if a special agent trying to use a civil summonses for the criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.779" offset="6174490">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.835" offset="6190686">This case case is here in the form of a denial of intervention affirmed by the Court of Appeals and we have briefed and are prepared to argue the issues involved partly with reference to general principles of the law of intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.732" offset="6258291">But the manner in which the case arose suggests that the substance of what is at issue is no ordinary question of intervention at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.074" offset="6303640">This has been illuminated to some extent by questions from the bench but I believe that it will be helpful to make this analytical framework explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.449" offset="6349197">The court proceeding in which the petitioner seeks to intervene is in effect one that he himself created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.642" offset="6385977">There would have been no summonses enforcement proceeding in the District Court and indeed no judicial proceeding of any kind in which the petitioner or anyone else could seek to intervene had the petitioner not secured from the District Court a preliminary injunction restraining the witnesses summoned by the Internal Revenue Service from complying with the summonses until ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.737" offset="6502275">The record shows they were willing to comply with the summonses and but for that preliminary injunction, there would have been no occasion for an enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.348" offset="6548773">So the petitioner in one important sense understates the case when he contends that he is the real party in interest in the enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.931" offset="6599137">There is simply is no issue in that proceeding other than the question whether the petitioner will be permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.030" offset="6635499">And if so, whatever issues, he will be allowed to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.339" offset="6656711">In other words, the case in substance involves nothing but an attempt by the petitioner to secure judicial interference with the conducting of an Internal Revenue Service investigation, an investigation relating to his tax liabilities, but directed in this instance only to third persons and to records that are not his and that do not embody any confidential communication, whose disclosure he claims, he is legally privileged to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.241" offset="6808325">On this view of the case, it is difficult to see why the petitioner stands on any different footing from that of any other person who wishes to prevent or interfere with an investigation of third persons by Government officials because he fears that the investigation may eventuate in the bringing of civil or criminal proceedings against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.135" offset="8855907">Now, this is the kind of anticipatory challenge by someone not yet directly affected by an investigation that the courts have generally refused to entertain with regard to any kind of official investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.422" offset="8921109">The general rule in our view and we recognize that there are exceptions to it, but the general rule whether articulated in terms of standing or of ripeness or of adequate remedy at law has been that such challenges should be made in the form of a motion to suppress or in other proper objection to the use of the fruits of the investigation when and if civil or criminal proceedings are actually brought against the complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.594" offset="9045765">And one consideration underlying this general is the prejudice to the public interest that would result from unwarranted interruptions and postponements of official investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.937" offset="9103130">To cite only one example, statutes of limitations would continue to run while possibly protracted litigation might take place concerning the manner in which the officials were attempting to conduct their investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.216" offset="9168227">And this general rule is also intended to protect the courts against unnecessary impositions on their time by the bringing of anticipatory and piecemeal litigation by persons who may never be harmed and who will have adequate opportunities to assert their claims if and when they are directly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.278" offset="9272508">And indeed judicial economy is also a significant consideration in the law of intervention itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.681" offset="9306049">For example, on pages 14 and 15 of our brief, there is a quotation from a recent thoughtful opinion of the Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia on the subject of intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.040" offset="9355577">In Smuck against Hobson, and with the Court?s permission I?d like to read the first sentence of that quotation which says, ?The decision whether intervention of right is warranted does involve an accommodation between two potentially conflicting goals to achieve judicial economies of scale by resolving related issues in a single lawsuit and to prevent the single lawsuit from becoming fruitlessly complex or unending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.035" offset="9491519">But in the present case, both of these considerations are on the same side of the balance and the side opposing intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.245" offset="9532374">Instead of seeking to consolidated lawsuits, the petitioner here is attempting to proliferate them, not only by inducing the present summonses enforcement proceeding, but also as we show in our brief in footnote 8 on page 23, by inducing similar proceedings in the District Courts in the Eastern District of Louisiana and the Southern District of Illinois in which the same issues were raised in an attempt to intervene against subpoenas of other witnesses who have records bearing on Mr. Donaldson?s tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.212" offset="9696214">If there are counterbalancing considerations favoring intervention or favoring standing which may be the more accurate way to put it, they must inhere and whatever interest of his that the petitioner claims would be adversely affected by compliance with the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.617" offset="9773850">And we believe therefore that the Court of Appeals correctly analyzed this case as turning on the nature of the interests the petitioner is asserting and how those interests would be affected by compliance with the subpoenas and we contend that the court correctly concluded that the interests asserted are not sufficient to bring the petitioner within any proper exception to the general rule against interference with investigations of third persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.097" offset="14555721">If I may possibly I can clarify some of the questions that were left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.454" offset="14581217">In response to a -- your inquiry Mr. Justice Black as to whether or not the individuals are put under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.503" offset="14613400">There -- as a practical matter two procedures are followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.722" offset="14630222">When a summonses is served, if it is served that the place of business, an individual is not formally sworn under oath then asked to give the records over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.590" offset="14673690">However, under the Internal Revenue Code, any information given to an officer of the Internal Revenue Service is considered to be the equivalent of being given under oath, since it is subject to a perjury charge if it is false whether he be sworn actually or not sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.534" offset="14745475">The Section of the Internal Revenue Code provides specifically for perjury charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.956" offset="14763238">The second type of practical application is where an individual will be served with a summonses and requested to appear at the Internal Revenue Office, in office there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.768" offset="14802422">The reference to the hearing officer in the Reisman case as is indicated in further on in the case is to the agent that issued the summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.845" offset="14834709">He in essence conducts a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.207" offset="14844217">I think as Justice Black pointed out, it?s an informal grand jury if you would with a one man grand jury sitting there and he proceeds to gather evidence and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.730" offset="14886327">I might point out to the court that on page 9 of our appendix in the brown cover, the summonses reproduced and the beginning of the summonses reads, ?Greeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.524" offset="14933452">You are hereby summoned and required to appear before me, an officer of Internal Revenue Service,? and it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.516" offset="14965426">In the same style that a subpoena would be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.406" offset="14977024">The summonses on the bottom makes note of the fact that failure to comply with these summonses will render you liable to proceedings in the District Courts and on the backside of the summonses, it proceeds to tell you, you can be found of contempt and fined up to a thousand dollars and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.403" offset="15040972">It?s a very commanding thing given to an individual on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.890" offset="15058944">Judge -- Chief Justice Burger had asked whether the United States in essence is really saying that, had something else been used, the taxpayer would not have objected if the same information could've been gotten by a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.728" offset="15130311">Oh!</text>
