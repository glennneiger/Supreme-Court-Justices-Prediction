            <label>Mr. Louis Sherman</label>
            <text syncTime="147.647" offset="694000">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.235" offset="704345">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.887" offset="714898">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review a per curiam opinion affirming a decision, the judgment and jury verdict of the District Court in the amount of $152,500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.672" offset="798072">In favor of George Hardeman, an expelled member of the Boilermakers union, who filed a complaint in the Federal District Court April 1966 under Section 102 of the Landrum-Griffin Act alleging that he’d been deprived of the full and fair hearing under Section 101 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="195.620" offset="885844">The evidence at the District Court trial was of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.075" offset="907682">First, the various proceedings before the union tribunals, such as the 172 page transcript of record, of the hearing that was held which resulted in his expulsion, which went in to the details of his beating up the business manager, which is the principal reason for his expulsion, and the proceedings at higher levels when the case was appealed to the president of the International and the executive counsel of International.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.627" offset="1033906">The second evidence had to do with loss of wages which are computed on the basis of past and future.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.776" offset="1062431">Mr. Hardeman was 43 when this incident occurred in October of 1960, and they figured it on the basis of mortality tables that he would retire at 65, $6,000.00 and therefore plus some punitive damages that came out of this total figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.886" offset="1154905">Now, the first part of the case has to do with the issue of full and fair hearing which is set out at page 2 of our brief, the language of Section 101 (a) (5) of the Landrum-Griffin Act, which states that “no member of any labor organization must be fined, suspended, expelled or otherwise disciplined except for non- payment of dues, unless its members been (a) served with written specific charges (b) given the reasonable time to prepare the defense (c) afford with a full and fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.470" offset="1333269">There’s no issue here on the written specific charges they were made, whether he’s given a reasonable time to prepare his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.904" offset="1362944">The issue is whether he is afford to full and fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.200" offset="1376214">In the literal sense, there should be no question of that either, because the hearing took about ten hours, there were witnesses, cross-examination and the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.197" offset="1416129">We concede full and fair hearing means something more than that, that there must be some evidence to support the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.319" offset="1452596">And we think that the trial judge erred and this Court of Appeals erred in a way that’s very important to the labor movement at finding there was no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.498" offset="1513409">The essential charges had to do with the bylaws of the local union which was set forth at page 4 in the language of the constitution of the Boilermakers relating to subordinate lodges.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.934" offset="1603062">A first test of the bylaws, they’re very explicit that the local could after proper hearing, punish as warranted by the offense for violation which is defined as “violence, a threat thereof to intimidate any official of this international brotherhood a subordinate lodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.360" offset="1676831">Prevent or attempt to prevent him from proper discharging his duties of his office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="398.606" offset="1697834">And the language of the Subordinate Lodge Constitution was broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.904" offset="1723016">It provided for expulsion for any member endeavors to create dissention among the members, or who works against the interest and harmony of the brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.217" offset="1760214">Now, there’s no question about the evidence in my judgment as to the bylaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.618" offset="1797831">We have a clear statement not drawn by opposition witnesses but by Mr. Hardeman himself in the union case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.097" offset="1847777">This is the case before the union judges, if I may use the expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.959" offset="1867212">But I think it might be just rather read it literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.510" offset="1877452">He was unhappy about the way the business manager was administering a referral system as far as his own particular problems were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.429" offset="1909112">Like some other people, he was thinking in terms of a quick instrument of change, violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.622" offset="1933876">So he’s sitting there in the union hall, and this is his language at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.977" offset="1959267">”I tried to make up my mind what to do whether to sue the local or Wise, who is the business manager, or beat the hell out of Wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.770" offset="1990405">And then I made up my mind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="475.147" offset="2003989">Now, that would seem to be pretty good evidence of violation of the bylaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.832" offset="2034709">The district judge in his charge to the jury, which is set forth in our appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.866" offset="2134810">He didn’t choose the more peaceful method of suing, of going to the joint referral committee which existed for complaints of the sort he had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.924" offset="2187055">He beat him until he got some kind of statement that satisfied him that Wise wouldn’t jump at anyone on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.077" offset="2215685">That was the issue between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.800" offset="2234598">Now when it got to the District Court, of course, if you get the time relation straight, the incidents occurred in 1960 and this case was before the Federal District Court in 1968 I suppose when the trial took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.334" offset="2308681">Complaint was filed in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.060" offset="2319653">And if I may be indulged, I’d like to read the statement of the charge which is at our appendix page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.952" offset="2355179">This is the Federal District Court, now there maybe and I’m not ruling on it one way or the other, but I will say this that there is evidence in here which might support a finding of guilty under Section 1 of Article XII, the Subordinate Lodge By-Laws, where the trial body said “We find him guilty; we recommend that he be expelled.”</text>
            <text syncTime="582.566" offset="2433651">They didn’t say “We find him guilty under either one section or the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="586.049" offset="2447548">They said they found him guilty as much as nothing here which will support a conviction under this section, and I think the verdict cannot stand, and he’s being convicted a felony which was expelling him.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.405" offset="2484955">And I think in as much there’s no evidence which will support finding of guilty under this, of the finding of the board was erroneous and cannot stand in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.759" offset="2518392">Now, that is all charge, for those two sections and there’s nothing in this record that would just to -- finding him guilty under those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.185" offset="2548067">Now the use of the phrase “those sections” sounds like he’s talking about both sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.733" offset="2562278">It’s very difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.493" offset="2573354">All of it is about the fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.837" offset="2582758">I’m telling you as a matter of law that under the proof for finding its result it's being expelled, can I legally stand, therefore he is wrongfully expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.341" offset="2612746">Now the second issue before the union tribunal was a question of the violation of the Subordinate Lodge Constitution dealing with dissention, a work against the interest and harmony of the lodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.547" offset="2669589">But we think that in terms of the normal relationships between the courts at union tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.128" offset="2703862">If union tribunals are to be permitted to function in accordance with the realities of life recognizing that they are not literate and skilled lawyers that there must be some recognition of whether they have done justice in the real sense, or whether they have engaged in handling a trumped up case or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.572" offset="2793618">There’s nothing trumped up about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.495" offset="2805321">Counsel for Mr. Hardeman admits in his brief that he should’ve been disciplining because of the question about the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.852" offset="2838758">But this question of dissention -- working against the interest and harmony of the lodge, the local trial board found him guilty on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.646" offset="2877942">Now those are general words, but we think it was reasonable for the brothers to define dissention and harmony the way they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.832" offset="2926738">We think that the process of reasonable inference is available to administrative tribunals, and therefore, it certainly should be available to working people who are trying to work out their problems of maintaining the integrity of their institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.165" offset="2996015">What could be more calculated to cause dissention than a fist fight?</text>
            <text syncTime="728.562" offset="3017644">Now this wasn’t just a fist fight between two Boilermakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.138" offset="3031960">It’s a fist fight in which one Boilermaker, the soul the business manager who was not a very important fellow in this world, but on the little --</text>

            <text syncTime="898.772" offset="3698500">I beg your indulgence to read from a decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered by Judge Sobeloff.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.248" offset="3744371">“The same system of justice, those involved in the case of Hardeman is a system upon which the responsibility of the union rests in terms for example of handling lockout strikers.”</text>

            <text syncTime="935.212" offset="3844263">The parts, cases and illustrations of what happens when the union tries to assert its powers to maintain the validity of peaceful institutions, in that case the maintenance of a council industrial relations, just maintain peace in the electoral contracting industry for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.566" offset="3913644">Judge Sobeloff said “By the judicial application of ad hoc standards and the pursuit of what is called democracy in union government would have succeeded only introducing not democracy but chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.933" offset="3963068">This would not only tend to disintegrate the labor movement, but be responsible to thus generated could have serious implications for employers and others as well.”</text>
            <text syncTime="973.691" offset="3998177">And that is one of the serious problems facing the labor movement today that when the internationals are asked to assert their powers to maintain responsibility such as suppression of jurisdictional strikes that the cry comes back “hide and protect us against cases like Hardeman.”</text>
            <text syncTime="996.280" offset="4088456">How are we going to make sure we’re going to do the job to satisfy courts?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.025" offset="4143522">But cases of this sort which have been smashed aside, I think complete abandonment of the proper rules of review and the substitution of the court's views or the sort of thing that are preventing us from doing what should be done, not only in the interest of the labor movement, but also of others in the collective-bargaining relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.176" offset="6616064">You have to know a little bit of the background of this legislation to realize that the first there was the McClellan Amendment, the Bill of Rights which came up on the floor passed by a very narrow vote, and then as evidenced by McClellan’s own testimony, the labor movement got involved and helped to draft the Kuchel substitute which is intended to cut down the scope of the McClellan Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.642" offset="7401932">To understand the standard of review, I might recite the facts as Chief Justice Burger pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.421" offset="7437040">The union trial board found Mr. Hardeman, as well as Mr. Braswell, because we’re also reviewing the Braswell opinion here, guilty of two charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.147" offset="7479986">Article XII, Section 1 and Article XII, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.488" offset="7505272">Now, what they had done in affect was to charge them with those two charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.724" offset="7534320">The trial board came back and said “We find you guilty as charged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.157" offset="7555950">Now, we came into Court alleging in our complaint that we have been denied a full and fair hearing because the evidence did not support a finding of guilt or was there any evidence to support a finding of guilt under Article XIII, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.108" offset="7647796">Our position was this that Mr. Hardeman as well as Mr. Braswell were in the same position as a man on trial in a criminal case with the two-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.584" offset="7697742">One count charging him with a simple assault, the second count charging him with rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.873" offset="7722820">There being evidence of a simple assault but no evidence of any sexual contact, but the jury coming in and finding him guilty as charged, well guilty as charged necessarily includes the rape count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.966" offset="7775274">And that’s what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.833" offset="7782693">Now, we had two counts or two charges against Mr. Hardeman and Mr. Braswell in this case, and the first charge was XII (1) which stated that through the use of force of violence that Hardeman tried to restrain course or intimidate an official of the Brotherhood, the second charge incidentally there is no punishment set forth there, it’s open, apparently can be -- punishment can be administered according to the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.899" offset="7934934">And the second charge was Article XIII, Section 1 of the International Constitution which points out that any member who creates dissention among the members or who seeks to create a dissolution of the Brotherhood, or a division of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.129" offset="8023855">In essence, it describes someone who is trying to dissolve the union as an organization, and that Article says that anyone who is guilty of this will be suspended, will be -- not suspended but expelled from the Brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.021" offset="8087489">Now, it doesn’t leave any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.966" offset="8099192">There’s no lesser penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.284" offset="8104521">It’s just like a state statute that says “If you commit first degree murder, you will be sentenced for life or your life will be taken from you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.227" offset="8156244">And that’s what Article XIII does, it's a much more serious penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.407" offset="8172962">Now, when he was found guilty, when these men were found guilty, the expulsion vote that Mr. Sherman mentioned was really superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.116" offset="8211832">They didn’t need -- if they hadn’t done it or if they voted not to expel them, they would’ve still been expelled by virtue of the fact they were found guilty under Article XIII, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.088" offset="8251747">Now, it should be noted, these gentlemen took necessary appeals in the union, and in doing so, they were necessarily prejudiced in their defense because they had to presume they were found guilty of both, and so by doing this, they had to be found guilty of both.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.033" offset="8499493">And when it came before the Brotherhood, when they -- a motion for expulsion was offered, the Brotherhood would’ve said “Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.734" offset="8534288">Let’s vote against this because it’s too harsh.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.960" offset="8547244">As it was, when the motion for expulsion was offered, the Brotherhood knew they had been found guilty of a Section demanding expulsion, so why not go ahead and vote for it.</text>
