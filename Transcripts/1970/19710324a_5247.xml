            <text syncTime="26.208" offset="208227">Mr. Justice Black and may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.902" offset="231006">This case presents the question of the effect of a constitutionally invalid death sentence instruction upon petitioner's conviction for rape under the District of Columbia Rape Statute where the evidence of guilt was not compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.561" offset="301641">Briefly the facts, petitioner was convicted largely on the testimony of the complaining witness who testified that she was on her way to work on January 22, 1967 at Saint Elizabeth's Hospital when her car broke down in front of a gas station.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.290" offset="384502">She went to the gas station to seek help.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.093" offset="399757">Petitioner drove into the same gas station purely by happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.330" offset="424730">He volunteered to push the petitioner's car to the parking lot at Saint Elizabeth's Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.388" offset="456913">She accepted his offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.897" offset="470915">Upon arrival at the parking lot, she testified that he forced her into his car and drove off.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.713" offset="506232">Shortly thereafter, they stopped at a gas station where he purchased a dollar's worth of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.733" offset="538311">There was an attendant present.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.971" offset="547297">She made no outcry.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.619" offset="553880">No effort whatsoever to seek the assistance of the attendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.574" offset="577703">They then drove off to a secluded spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.846" offset="598706">They talked for awhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.977" offset="607274">He asked whether she was married, she said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.631" offset="621902">He asked whether she loved her husband, she said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.782" offset="638516">He then asked her to remove her underclothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.917" offset="651055">She proceeded to do so without any protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.384" offset="672893">Following which, an act of intercourse took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.614" offset="689821">After the act of intercourse, at her request he drove her back to the -- to work to the Saint Elizabeth's parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.050" offset="731617">She gave him her car keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.109" offset="743842">He gave her his correct phone number.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.321" offset="768606">He promised to return that afternoon to help start her car.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.659" offset="793997">He did return that afternoon when he was promptly arrested and charged with rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.634" offset="821896">Throughout the entire episode, the complaining witness offered no protest or resistance by word or action because she said she was in fear for her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.555" offset="869543">She testified that she suffered from a thyroid condition but no medical testimony was adduced to corroborate this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.594" offset="905697">The complaining witness was unmarked.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.331" offset="916668">There was no evidence of force other than her own testimony that she was in fear for her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.792" offset="946552">Petitioner took the stand in his own defense, admitted that he pushed the complaining witness his car to the lot but denied the act of intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.034" offset="991483">Petitioner was indicted and tried under the provisions of 28 -- D.C. Code 2801 which is reproduced on page 3 of our brief which gives a jury discretion to sentence a defendant to death for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.995" offset="1071313">At the outset of the trial, the prosecution announced that the case was a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.152" offset="1095973">But that the government was not seeking of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.997" offset="1107362">Nevertheless, the case was tried before a death qualified jury with one juror being excused because she stated that her opposition to capital punishment will prevent her from returning a verdict of guilty if as a consequence, petitioner might be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.176" offset="1180087">The court judged the jury that even though the Government was not seeking the death penalty, it was free to sentence petitioner to death if they found them guilty and that if they were unable to agree that the death penalty should be imposed, they should merely return a verdict of guilty and the court would impose an appropriate penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.348" offset="1260753">A portion of the charge with respect to the death penalty is set forth at pages 297 and 298 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.124" offset="1299832">Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment from 6 to 18 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.410" offset="1425011">I don't believe so Mr. Harlan -- Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.408" offset="1440998">His direct appeal to the Court of Appeals was pending when the court's -- this Court's decision in United States v. Jackson 390 U.S. 573 was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.931" offset="1483107">The Court of Appeals panel which heard the appeal affirmed the petitioner conviction with Senior Judge Fahy dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.965" offset="1515186">Petitioner's conviction was again affirmed by the Court of Appeals on rehearing en banc in a divided opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.916" offset="1551026">Four of the judges on the Court of Appeals dissented on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain petitioner's conviction and three, disserted on the additional ground that petitioner was prejudiced by the trial of this case as a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.172" offset="1640051">If the Court please, petitioner here contends that his conviction violates this Court's holding in the Jackson case and that he was tried for a capital offense when he should not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.524" offset="1717478">More particularly, it is our contention that the death sentence instruction gave the jury an impermissible choice of verdicts which might have resulted in a compromise verdict in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.976" offset="1799293">Petitioner's principle contention here is eloquently stated in the dissent of Judge Fahy below.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.617" offset="1837850">After quoting with approval from the opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall, then Circuit Court -- then Circuit Judge Marshall -- excuse me Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.480" offset="1885288">In the Hetenyi versus Wilkins case, Judge Fahy states and I'm quoting from the appendix at page 346, “We cannot surmise, there was no likelihood of the jury considering the availability to them of the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.642" offset="1957909">We have no basis for such a surmise.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.110" offset="1967835">And it is the erroneous availability of the death sentence, not the likelihood of its rendition that gives rise to the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.666" offset="2002004">It may have exerted an indiscernible influence on jurors in deciding whether to find guilt but without the death sentence or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.838" offset="2038680">One or more jurors with his or her attitude about the crime of rape reinforced by the statutory provision for a death sentence might have been so influenced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="494.893" offset="2082983">As stated by the Second Circuit in Wilkins, supra, 348 F.2d at 867, “It is sufficient if there is a reasonable possibility of prejudice for the Court erroneously to give the jury a range of verdicts more severe than the law allows in the case on trial is for the Court erroneously to influence the jury adversely to the accuse.”</text>
            <text syncTime="522.301" offset="2192593">As result, the verdict rendered maybe more severe then otherwise it would have been even if not the most severe committed by the erroneous instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.488" offset="2509302">Jackson holds that he was by electing to stand trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.904" offset="2542947">He was exposed to greater punishment than he would have been if he had waived his right to a jury trial or pleaded guilty and this was the constitutional defect which voided the penalty scheme in the Kidnapping Act and the same scheme was incorporated in the D.C. Rape Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.139" offset="2619956">Only the jury under the D.C. Rape Statute could sentence a defendant to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.987" offset="2763316">It gave them the right to return a verdict of guilty with the death penalty as we read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.424" offset="2789021">They were really three possibilities here and the guilty as charged verdict could be construed as a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.179" offset="2856103">If the jury had returned a verdict of guilty with the death penalty, that could have been similar to aggravated rape, ordinary rape perhaps guilty as charged, or not guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="1561.143" offset="6347943">We do make that argument at some length in our brief and I had planned to refer to it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.434" offset="6373125">I think it is set forth quite adequately in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.954" offset="6395173">The main thrust of petitioner's argument here is that the instructions to the jury on the death penalty issue may have interfered with the jury's deliberations on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.588" offset="6449716">And heavy reliance is placed on this Court's decision last term in Price v. Georgia in the 1966 Second Circuit's opinion in the Hetenyi v. Wilkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.015" offset="6511470">Those cases of course involve the double jeopardy problem of retrying a person for murder after he had been found guilty only if the lesser included defense and that conviction had been upset on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.904" offset="6578970">The analogy petitioner seeks to draw between the Price and Wilkins situations in this case are unsound for several different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.960" offset="6619199">First reason is that -- in each of the former cases, the murder charge was one of the principle issues, perhaps the principle issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.394" offset="6668936">Each prosecutor had sought to establish first-degree murder and the jury's deliberations on the defendant's guilt in those cases would necessarily center in and focus on that first-degree murder charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.954" offset="6727137">By contrast, the death penalty issue in this case played a very insignificant role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.355" offset="6756812">Some statistics are worthy of note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.094" offset="6767783">Since 1930, only three persons have been executed for rape in the District of Columbia, the last one occurring in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.295" offset="6816580">As far as I could discover, no jury has imposed a death penalty in a rape case since the 1950's and at least in the last several years, the Government has not sought to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.379" offset="6876871">Turning to this case, the prosecutor specifically stated during voir dire that he was not seeking the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.131" offset="6915845">After the voir dire, neither the prosecutor nor petitioner's trial counsel again referred to the death penalty issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.783" offset="6950536">In a summation, the prosecutor merely requested a verdict of guilty as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.588" offset="6977703">And then of course during the charge to the jury, the judge twice repeated that the Government was not seeking the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.644" offset="7013961">Nor that the evidence presented by the Government make it likely that the jury would seriously consider imposing the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.941" offset="7043114">This was not a case of aggravated rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.753" offset="7062340">Petitioner's argument on the sufficiency of the evidence really cuts two ways here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.706" offset="7090239">He argues that the evidence did not really establish none consent but we maintain that the closer the evidences on the consent issue, the less likely it is that the Government would -- that the jury would seriously consider imposing the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.900" offset="7343000">They did not specifically refer the harmless error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.464" offset="7361181">But this whole argument I'm making now, I think supports the finding that a petitioner was not prejudiced but beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.963" offset="7415202">We're now turning to this compromise contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.844" offset="7430771">We believe that that is also the analogy with Price and Wilkins doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.830" offset="7462640">In Price and Wilkins, there was the choice of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or voluntary manslaughter and not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.067" offset="7511646">Before the jury could unanimously return a verdict of guilty of the second of the lesser included defense which they did in both Price and Wilkins, the juries holding out for not guilty had to give up their insistence on that verdict and the guilty is whole -- the jury is holding out for first-degree murder had to give up their existence on that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.936" offset="7619166">So obviously there was a possibility of compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.783" offset="7638497">As Mr. Justice White pointed out that that does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.043" offset="7655528">The jurors did not have to agree on the death penalty issue so that in order to return a verdict of guilty, if it's not necessary that the jurors might have thought that they should impose a death penalty, give up anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.510" offset="8013406">I think if you read the last two paragraphs in the bottom of page 297 in conjunction with that, it's perfectly clear that the trial judge instructed the jury to first of all determine the guilt question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.449" offset="8141197">I don't really think that this charge is ambiguous on that point at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.850" offset="8286751">Well, to begin with the jury in this case was not truly death qualified and that the prosecutor did not seek to obtain a jury which would return the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.978" offset="8331264">The prosecutor merely sought to -- merely sought to have a jury which would be unbiased on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.283" offset="8372537">In his sole question to the jurors was whether their views on capital punishment would interfere with their ability to return a verdict of guilty if the evidence so compelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.483" offset="8437321">Now several decisions of this Court have established that the exclusion of persons for views of -- on capital punishment cannot be held to -- that the evidence simply is insufficient to hold that that would bias, make the jury prosecution prone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.748" offset="8530317">The Witherspoon case so held in Bumper and North Carolina, the same result was reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.742" offset="8610356">He -- Pope received the death penalty but in remanding this case, this case simply remanded for re-sentencing, therefore, impliedly holding that Pope was not prejudiced on the question of guilt, although that point was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.266" offset="8704397">I would like briefly to refer to the remaining points made in petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.033" offset="8739506">He argues the sufficiency of the evidence that that issue actually involves both questions of fact and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.825" offset="8778689">The legal question involves a proper interpretation of the phrase forcibly and against her will as contained in the D.C. Rape Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.851" offset="8818813">Both the majority and the dissenting opinion below recognized that under the prevailing and proper interpretation of that statute overcoming the resistance of a woman by placing her in fear of death were serious bodily harm was equivalent to using force to overcome physical resistance, so the disagreement centered on what was necessary to establish fear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.447" offset="10009161">However, the petitioner did offer evidence on the consent issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.185" offset="10032149">He offered the evidence, that Mrs. Fooshie, the hospital supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.442" offset="10053151">And she testified that Mrs. Maze had first asked for leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.776" offset="10074467">That can only be relevant on the issue of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.959" offset="10083244">Mrs. Fooshie however, further testified in direct contradiction of the defenses theory that intercourse had not taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.041" offset="10115532">She placed the arrival of Mrs. Maze at the hospital at 7:30 whereas petitioner had testified that he had left her office at 6:45 and another witness testified that petitioner was home by 7:00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.823" offset="10178644">So, really petitioner was arguing inconsistent defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.661" offset="10209991">Even if the prosecutor's isolated remarks here were somewhat in excess, this case is no way comparable to the Burger case, the 1935 decision of this Court reversing for prosecutorial misconduct where the misconduct there pervaded the entire trial and included many different items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.253" offset="10308420">And I just -- will close in noting that the Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia examines very closely charges of prosecutorial misconduct as the case United States against Stevenson, that's 424 F.2d. 923.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.876" offset="10394833">They cite a whole bunch of cases there in which they have examined it but neither the majority nor the dissent in this case, felt called upon and comment on this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.612" offset="10701824">Now, if the Court please, this record in its entire -- in its entirety cannot be read without getting the feeling that there has been some kind of miscarriage of justice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.586" offset="10761697">This was true at the point of trial in the Court of Appeals, the point of the Court of Appeals opinions, at a 5 to 4 split.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.499" offset="10789386">It's particularly true now that we have the issues of the United States v. Jackson violation and the Price case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.400" offset="10841004">We feel that this case does come under the reasoning of the Price case but we're not asking this Court to make any broad pronouncement of constitutional significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.505" offset="10877367">This Court can exercise its supervisory powers over the federal courts and reverse its conviction if it feels that has been substantial error or substantial in justice below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.320" offset="10932642">As regards, the point made by Mr. Huntington so far as the statistics are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.262" offset="10976423">Of course the jury didn't know how many rape defendants had been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.816" offset="11006621">It's impossible to impute this knowledge into the minds of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.512" offset="11017383">I think we'll be making a basic mistake by assuming that the only issue here is the issue of the death sentence instruction and how it affected the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.136" offset="11063881">We have a broad issue in that the defendant was tried for a capital offense when he shouldn't have been and he was exposed to all the incidence of a capital trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.543" offset="11113514">This Court has recognized the distinction between being tried for a capital offense and other offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.601" offset="11137755">Indeed, it was recognized in the opinion in Price v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.302" offset="11176626">In which I think in Price v. Georgia the Court said that to be charged with a capital offense, of course that went off on double jeopardy but they did say that it's an ordeal not to be viewed lightly, the language of this Court in Price v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.484" offset="11233259">Thank you for your attention.</text>
