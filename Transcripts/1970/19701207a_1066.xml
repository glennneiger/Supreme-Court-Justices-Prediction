            <text syncTime="24.675" offset="202062">We seek an application to stay the respondents in this case, the Secretary of Transportation and the Commissioner and the Department of Highways of the State of Tennessee, from authorizing the beginning of construction of a six-lane interstate highway which will pass through Overton Park, a large public park located in Memphis, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.122" offset="295894">If this stay is not granted, the respondents will authorize construction, and that construction will proceed before this Court has an opportunity to act on a petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.336" offset="540714">Yes sir, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.019" offset="551476">If the respondents are permitted to proceed with this construction, they may likely moot this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.699" offset="578121">If they do, they would have been successful without ever having filed an answer to the petitioner's complaint, without putting one witness on the witness stand, without having one of their officials subject to examination by deposition, but instead on a basis, out of court, the litigation affidavits, filed in support of a motion for summary judgment, that's the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.629" offset="673938">So, the decision below is based solely on affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.744" offset="690343">The District Court granted summary judgment which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.952" offset="715212">This case arises under a statute passed in 1966 which articulates a national policy for preserving park lands, recreation areas, historic sites, waterfowl and wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.549" offset="777592">That statute provides that the Secretary of Transportation shall not approve any project which affects a parkland or recreation area, unless there are no feasible and prudent alternatives, or unless the design of the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.379" offset="864841">The park which is involved in this case is a large 342 acre public park located in Memphis, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.146" offset="903920">It has within it approximately a 170-acres of Woodland Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.074" offset="931715">As of 1965, it's constituted one-half, of the City of Memphis; Memphis's woodland Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.697" offset="958151">If this highway goes through that part of the park, according to Department of Interior officials who proposed this project, there will be very little left of the Woodland park.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.937" offset="1111124">This highway project involves a construction of the six-lane interstate highway with the right of way between 250 feet and 450 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.099" offset="1151770">As it proceeds through the wooded area of the park, if it's constructed, as it's presently planned, it will take a swath of 450 feet out of the wooded section, and pass through a small picturesque lake and a pond.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.988" offset="1215300">It will pass immediately adjacent to the zoo, and it will be a literal barrier to either side of the park.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.051" offset="1343613">No, Your Honor, the figures in this record are that to tunnel it and they suggest two types of tunnels, it would cost, they estimate, they don't have any calculations, they are estimates, would cost up to $40 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.022" offset="1399411">There is however, a suggestion that was made by the Department of Interior officials for fully depressed ground which would not be a tunnel, and there are no cost figures on that design.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.969" offset="1463254">No, I think there is an estimate of $40 million but that involves first fully depressing and then totally covering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.881" offset="1494915">What is known as I understand is a cut-and-covered tunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.004" offset="1507349">But, if you simply depressed it all the way through the park, that would minimize harm to the park, but there are no cost figures on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.381" offset="1540890">And my point, incidentally they have raised an objection that this would create certain drainage problems within -- there's a small creek which runs through the park, and they maintain that this -- it can't go pass that creek where the depressed ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.636" offset="1593866">There are affidavits on file, in this case which suggest that difficulty could be overcome by standard engineering techniques which are use in the interstate system, just today, have been in use in the interstate system for sometime, if they refused to use them in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.817" offset="2094686">Now, in the Department of Transportation, in the Secretary's papers which are on file, he's maintained that those alternatives were rejected because of large displacement of persons and businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.222" offset="2144214">In his affidavit, he gives you some statistics, as to the number of people who'd be displaced by the route which goes to North and that which goes to the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.011" offset="2183398">What he doesn't give you in the affidavit is the number of people who'd be adversely affected not only in the use of the park but in their home's and businesses by the route which uses the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.086" offset="2227702">And when you search the record further and find those statistics, they demonstrate that the alternative to the North of the park which he rejected actually either displaces more people from their homes or adversely affects people in their businesses or schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.193" offset="2292172">So, the test which he asserts, he's applied in this case, was mis-applied, if the test is the number of people who'd be adversely affected, or the number of people who will be displaced from their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.250" offset="2352358">The route to the North according to their own calculation will either displace or adversely affect 2386 people and route through the park according to their own figures, will adversely affect to displace 2607 people, actually more people than the route to the North.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.827" offset="2438666">And this is the case, even though in their calculation they've made no allowance for the people, they've not counted as adversely affected people who use the park.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.967" offset="6695267">This map shows and there is mark on map, only the portion of the highway that we are now considering, it does extend on out at the present time to the ends of this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.257" offset="6760364">The route will run along what is an existing non-access bus road, which including the clear right-of-way on either side is presently 40 to 50 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.428" offset="6809057">Along the North edge of the road from West to East for about two-thirds of distance of the bus route is a 6 to 8 foot chain-link fence, presently separating the zoo from the rest of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.036" offset="6867466">The zoo is up in the North area and at the present time the city is expanding zoo facilities East.</text>

            <text syncTime="4525.227" offset="18204296">There was at one time when Department of Transportation Act was passed, Section 4 (f) was included and it said, “the Secretary shall not approve any project unless there are no feasible and prudent alternatives or unless the design includes all possible planning to minimize harm.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.101" offset="18275767">There was at that time a Section 138 in the Federal-Aid Highway Act that was slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.270" offset="18308472">In 1968, it was decided to make those identical and there was an amendment in 1968, but the requirements concerning feasible and prudent alternatives, and the requirements concerning all possible planning were in the 1966 Act, were applicable to this case and indeed the Department of Transportation considered them applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.626" offset="18401886">Now Mr. Bridwell testified before Congress on one occasion concerning certain aspects of this case and he said, Section 4(f) came into play.</text>
