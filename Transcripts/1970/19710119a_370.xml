            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="20.158" offset="183986">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.603" offset="205824">With reference to the question posed by Mr. Justice White, I would like quote Judge Coffman in the Pepsi Cola decision as to the requirements the Court’s consideration of the record and the board’s findings under Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.171" offset="292028">He states in an unfair practice proceeding, the board cannot completely advocate its responsibility to a regional director a functionary whose appointment is not even subject to consideration by the Senate as are those of board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.179" offset="356080">Moreover the board’s experience is particularly relevant and desirable in deciding complex issues relating to the appropriate bargaining unit before the potent sanctions arising from the finding of an unfair labor practice are invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.139" offset="411878">Where the choices between two fairly conflicting views, the Court must defer to the board’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.278" offset="436433">But here, the board has not actually considered the questions of fact in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.511" offset="453465">The board has merely rubber-stamped his decision and thus the regional director’s decision was perpetuated even though it may have been in fact wrong and we too would be blindly endorsing the question about result.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.585" offset="509680">Such difference to the regional director was not intended by Congress, it decided that the board itself must grow whether a litigant has committed an unfair labor practice, we see no basis for thus mutilating the legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.236" offset="564328">And Judge Butzner and the claimant wife said in a case that also involved the use of summary judgment that the use of summary judgment in deciding whether an employer had committed an unfair labor practice does not exempt the board from complying with the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.578" offset="633710">And the board’s earlier consideration of the company’s request for review of the regional director’s decision, does not supply the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.174" offset="664116">For them, the board as in the Magnesium case simply denied the request – that was my interpolation simply denied the request with the observation that it raised no substantial issues, warrants and review.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.543" offset="713540">The board is charged with a duty of stating the reasons why the board concluded the facts that showed a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.157" offset="739976">No statutory exception to this rule exist because critical elements of the controversy were determined preliminarily by the regional director and the representation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.041" offset="779577">The board, not the regional director has the responsibility of deciding complaints --</text>

            <text syncTime="186.547" offset="849586">I think the substantial portion of it would, because the regional director based his decision substantially upon the evidence testimony given by the witness who subsequently stated, admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.531" offset="921475">Would you agree that it would ordinarily take it very strong showing on an issue of that kind that is rejection of the newly discovered evidence claimed to engage the attention of this Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="218.087" offset="975705">I think the fact that he admitted that he had withheld information at the hearing before the regional director would be that kind of strong evidence sir.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="231.433" offset="1029099">Mr. Chandler let me bring you back to the question I asked as we closed last night, I didn’t sense an answer to it in the material which you read at the length just now.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.174" offset="1076120">Is it your position that when the board does not formally review the regional director’s determination, that review is forever lost in the Court of Appeals for example?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_chandler" startTime="265.676" stopTime="396.474">
            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="265.676" offset="1166085">Yes, in this sense Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.951" offset="1187192">The review must under Section 10 (e) as it reads and as I interpreted include a review of the board findings as well as making a determination based upon substantial evidence on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.936" offset="1271097">And the board findings are as set forth as required in Section 10 (c) requiring the preponderance of the evidence that be used by the board in making its determination so that they must be read together and in an analysis by the Bureau of National Affairs made on the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, they have a specific reference to the exceptions to the APA under a comment in Section 5 which talks about the division of fall as between the functionaries like the regional director and board members even on the exceptions and one exception if you recall was that relating to the certification of employee representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.572" offset="1449671">And then the analysis the BNA says with respect to the accepted matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.113" offset="1467852">The Senate Judiciary Committee emphasizes that administrative agency should not apply the exemption to such cases as tend to be accusatory in form and involved sharply controverted factual issues since the prescribed exceptions are not to be interpreted as precluding the statutory procedure under APA where it is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.260" offset="1568371">And I submit sir that the Congress did not intend the delays inherent in the board’s refusal independently to review the evidence in an unfair labor practice case so that the boards would feel -- the board would feel -- the parties rather would feel compelled to take the cases to a Circuit Court to secure their first review of all the evidence presented at the regional director level or being on a substantial rather than the preponderance of evidence test as the statute provides.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="396.474" offset="1689266">My question I come back to, what is directed to whether the issue is reviewable in the Court of Appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_chandler" startTime="404.110" stopTime="438.519">
            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="404.110" offset="1719777">Not on the basis that the law provided for, Congress provided that a preponderance of evidence test first be applied by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.018" offset="1763453">That’s in Section 10 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="417.172" offset="1772022">The Court reviews it on the basis of substantial evidence and then not reviewing the board’s finding so that the parties I submit are being deprived of their rights under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.334" offset="1828760">And also of course under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and Judge Coffman in relying --</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="452.648" offset="1913919">Expressly and this is what I quarrel with because when Judge Coffman states that a difficult question was involved and that he was relying on the expertise of the regional director which is set forth in record appendix page 205 and states at the last page of his decision that perhaps the board ruled or determined in its own mind that it was not a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.932" offset="2023111">I don’t believe that party should have to rely on the judge’s speculation as to the reason for the board’s action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="487.289" stopTime="492.057">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="487.289" offset="2052577">Was his statement that he was relying on the expertise of the regional director?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_chandler" startTime="492.057" stopTime="672.893">
            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="492.057" offset="2071594">On page 205 of the record appendix, he so indicated because there was no expertise of the board involved based upon all of the evidence because they refused to look at the evidence and that Pittsburgh Plate Glass which is the only case upon which the board relies was decided 1941 and in that case the board made its own findings on the representation case after the board members reviewed the evidence and it was decided five years before the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.587" offset="2185697">And as a matter of fact, in 1961, the board attempted by the means of the reorganization plan number five to get permission to delegate unfair labor practice cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.639" offset="2229896">And Congress rejected this proposal and the board should not now be permitted to accomplish administratively what it could not persuade Congress to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.373" offset="2260825">The desire to expedite does not give the board the right to legislate from the sense a waiver rights of the parties or to refuse to consider pertinent and vital newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.672" offset="2306069">The board so called rule against litigation when applied in this manner is directly contrary to Section 10 (c) of the Act and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.937" offset="2351104">I would like to call this honorable court’s attention to the case of Electronic Alloys in 183 NLRB 14, which was also an unfair labor practice case that arose from refusal to bargain after the board refused to review the regional director’s decision on an appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.693" offset="2418186">And the board stated in that unfair labor practice case on a motion for summary judgment in the respondent’s response to the notice to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.430" offset="2461132">The respondent contends that the board has never independently reviewed the record to determine whether the regional director was correct in concluding that the unit is appropriate for collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.450" offset="2513168">We have examined the decision and direction of election in that case, we have made an independent review of the record in that case and hold that the regional director’s findings and conclusions are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.737" offset="2562278">There's a footnote and they point to some findings that they disagree with, that do not affect the correctness of its ultimate conclusion that there is an appropriate unit and say accordingly as now all issues have been fully litigated and no newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence is offered, no further hearing is required and we shall therefore grant the general counsel’s motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.014" offset="2655378">The board thus acknowledges that while the review of a regional director’s decision in a representation case maybe discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.603" offset="2693831">Independent board review is required, should the representation case ripen into an unfair labor practice case and the petitioner here is entitled for no less if the law was to be administered fairly and without discrimination and the petitioner respectfully urges that the enforcement decree be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.665" offset="2782020">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="687.601" offset="2853804">May it please the Court Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.349" offset="2884733">As this Court is aware, an employer who contests the validity of a representation election conducted under Section 9 of the Act including the unit determination can obtain Court review of that determination only through an unfair labor practice proceeding under Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.661" offset="2990059">That is he can refuse to bargain on the grounds that the certification is invalid, thereby triggering of an unfair labor practice complaint as the board ultimately finds a violation of Section 8 (a) 5, an issues of bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.562" offset="3061635">He gets review of the bargaining order and of the underlying certification, a record of which is before the Court of Appeals by virtue of Section 9 (d) under Section 10 (e) and (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="754.891" offset="3122970">Now, since early Wagner Act days, it has been established that absent newly discovered evidence or other exceptional circumstances, the employer is not entitled to re-litigate in this Section 10 unfair labor practice proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.818" offset="3206666">Any issues which were or could have been litigated and determined in the prior related representation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.577" offset="3245641">And as this Court explained in the Pittsburgh Plate Glass case in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.028" offset="3275525">This is because the unit proceeding and the complaint on unfair labor practices are really one proceeding and thus a single trial of the representation issue was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.946" offset="3335189">Now, until 1959 the issues in a Section 9 representation proceeding as well as those in a Section 9 unfair labor practice proceeding were determined by the board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.199" offset="3396211">Now in that year, Congress amended Section 3 (b) to permit the board to delegate to it's regional directors its powers namely the boards powers under Section 9 including the power to determine the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining provided however that upon the request of an interested person the board, this is Congress's words may review any action of a regional director delegated to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.936" offset="3551065">Now, pursuant to this authorization, the board has delegated its powers to determine representation issues to its regional directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.310" offset="3604564">The procedures in brief are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.515" offset="3633403">They’re set for us in more detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.194" offset="3656182">When a petitioner's file and with the regional director and of investigation shows that it appears to have merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.534" offset="3693484">The regional directors sit down for hearing before a hearing officer and the basis of the record developed at the hearing and I might say that in examination of the appendix here shows that there was a very full hearing before the hearing officer with plenty of opportunity on the part of the employer to cross examine the witnesses including Scott on his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.972" offset="3831306">After this record is completed, it goes to regional director who determines on the basis of the record, the unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining and directs an election or makes other disposition of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.463" offset="3901210">The boards rules further provide that the regional director shall set forth his findings, conclusions and order or direction which he has gone in this case indeed the Court of Appeals found that the regional director’s decision was as full and complete as any that it had ever reviewed were the board itself had written the opinion was a very complete decision by the regional director.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.826" offset="4030673">The boards rules provide that the decision of the regional director shall be final unless a request for review is filed with the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.356" offset="4072782">Then the rules regarding review set forth a number of grounds upon which review maybe granted by the board or the regional director if he thinks that the issue is an important one that should be decided by the board has authority to transfer it forth with to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.670" offset="4170062">Now, where he has not done that and he did not do that here, a party after the director has decided the case can obtain review, if he persuades the board that his case falls within one of the four categories that are set forth in the boards rules, that there is a substantial question of law presented that procedural error was committed that there’s been a departure from board policy or/and that what’s involved in this case that the regional director’s decision on a factual issue is clearly erroneous on the record in such error prejudicially affects the rights of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.323" offset="4352711">The boards rules further provide that any request for review must be a self contained document enabling the board to rule on the basis of its contents and that would respect the ground to, which is the factual error ground or any other ground were appropriate said request must contain a summary of all evidence or rulings bearing on the issues together with page citations from the transcript in a summary of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.085" offset="4491682">And petitioner fully availed itself of its right under this rule to file with the board a very detailed request for review which starts at page 117 on the record and that goes to page 127 of the record, setting forth in very specific detail the respects in which the regional director erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.262" offset="4624384">What record references as to evidence that he allegedly overlooked with regard to the duties of Scott as well the other two individuals whose status was in question and also a very detailed legal argument as to the applicable legal principles and controlling board decisions that the regional director allegedly overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.333" offset="4756668">The board’s rules further provide that an opposition maybe filed to this request for review and although it’s not reprinted in the record, I find that in examining the original record that the petitioning union also filed a document with the board in opposition to the request for review which again contained a very detailed recital of the record evidence supporting the regional director’s ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.686" offset="4914134">The board had these two documents before it as well the decision of the regional director and on the basis of that decided that no issue warranting review was provided in that kind of a situation as the Court of Appeals pointed out in its opinion, it cannot be said that the board in deciding that no issue was presented merely rubberstamped the regional director you had as focus a presentation of the issues as you could possibly have had, had the board review the record de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.045" offset="5655594">The board's rules finally provide that denial of a request for review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director’s action which shall also preclude re-litigating any such issues in any related subsequent on the fair labor of practice proceeding and so that the issue that we really come down to here is whether or not this procedure is valid and authorized by section 3 (b) of the statute or put more specifically whether the board may properly apply the settled principle barring re-litigation and the subsequent related unfair labor practice proceeding of issues determined in the representation proceeding where it has delegated this authority to the regional director and pursuant to the 3 (b) delegation and has declined to review his determination or whether as petitioners contend and as the Second Circuit held in Pepsi Cola, the board is required before facing an unfair labor practice finding on this representation determination of the directors to make a new and de novo full review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.216" offset="6000201">I might say that the Second Circuit itself seems to have backed down substantially from Pepsi Cola in two decisions subsequent to Pepsi Cola which are cited in our brief, Olson Bodies and Bayliss Trucking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.398" offset="8793004">Had they come forward with newly discovered evidence, the trial examiner would have held a hearing with respect to the issue that was newly discovered and in the light of that evidence he would have reconsidered the regional director’s determination and then it would have gone up to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.727" offset="8898330">However, what happened here was that petitioner’s request or claim of newly discovered evidence was a bare naked allegation that Scott had allegedly withheld information as to his full supervisory duties with no indication whatsoever as to what it was that he withheld and then as the trial examiner found and as petitioner’s offer of proof shows which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.330" offset="9076694">Petitioner when it listed what it was going to show at this hearing list ticked off factors as to Scott’s power to discipline as his power to recommend raises and so on, a list of ten items, all of which had been gone in to very thoroughly in the representation case and which was subject to cross examination by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.660" offset="9198007">So the trial examiner found that in those circumstances the claim -- that there was newly discovered evidence here was merely a sham in that effort to attempt to re-litigate the very same issues that had been gone into extensively in the representation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.275" offset="9288495">And the Court of Appeals sustained that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.064" offset="9307617">So we submit that in those circumstances there are certainly no substantial issue that merits attention by this Court on the question of whether there was newly discovered evidence that would have warrant a hearing in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.712" offset="9526209">And I submit that the view of the First Circuit which has been adopted by the Tenth Circuit is the correct one and the one that is most consonant with the Congress's objective in enacting the Amendment to 3 (b) because the practical point of the matter is I think as Mr. Justice White pointed out yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.997" offset="9639372">If you are going to require the board when a representation determination ends up in a unfair labor practice proceeding and potentially any certification case can do that because that’s the only way the employer can get review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.364" offset="9712828">To review the record fully at that stage, you are not making the regional director’s determination final as Congress intended to do subject to merely discretionary review by the board and you are robbing the – R case delegation of the time saving that Congress intended to get from permitting the board to do that because whatever time you say that the – R case stage is going to be dissipated at the C case stage and we have statistics in our brief which show that it's rather dramatic that under the R case delegation and when the regional director is permitted to decide these things himself, the time from filing of a petition to direction of election is in the neighborhood of 48 days where as if it goes to the board, it’s about 245 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.919" offset="10019088">And he would just be substantially sapping the R case delegation of the value that Congress sought to achieve and if it is not necessary, we submit to protect the fundamental rights of respondents to board proceedings as is amply shown by the record in this case.</text>
