            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments in number 29, U.S. Bulk Carriers against Arguelles.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.596" offset="213765">Mr. Sullivan, I'm sure that you and your friend probably realize that if you want to get back to New York, one way to do it -- to New York and Baltimore respectively, one way to do it is to finish up this rapidly as you can.</text>

            <label>Mr. George W. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="42.941" offset="275101">We'll do our best Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.537" offset="297566">In this case, the petitioner a steamship operator has sought to review the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, a divided decision which reversed the U.S. District Court in the City of Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.848" offset="358797">The case involves an essence whether the grievance and arbitration procedures in the collective-bargaining agreement was negotiated by the National Maritime Union with the steamship employer will be the basis upon which the disputes that have arisen and are referred to in this case will be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.364" offset="452838">The initial cause of action as stated by the respondent in the District Court sought to recover firstly a transportation differential between first class and second class transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.428" offset="509053">That was resolved before the case ever got to its final posture in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.818" offset="534653">The next item in his claims involved certain overtime earnings that he said, he was entitled to, but had not been paid and these were disputed by the master of the vessel the time he signed of articles in the port of Saigon.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.197" offset="596198">The third issue involves alleged penalties to which he refers as a source of entitlement 46 U.S.C.A. Section 596.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.896" offset="650951">Now, to see this case more or less in the posture, I'd like to review briefly the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.021" offset="679476">Mr. Arguelles, American merchant seaman was engaged in the Court of Galveston, Texas on August 3, 1965, to service an ordinary seaman aboard the SS U.S. Pecos.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.766" offset="734438">This is a merchant vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.705" offset="738200">It's not a naval vessel despite U.S. in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.009" offset="755440">He served aboard the vessel and at the time when the six months which was the period of the articles he signed has part of his engagement expired on February 3, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.235" offset="800266">The vessel was entering an anchor -- anchorage off of Cap St. Jacques which is just off the coast of South Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.963" offset="835271">The vessel was destined to go to Saigon to discharge cargo which was in the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.679" offset="858049">The local authorities denied pratique -- they didn't deny pratique, they just didn't run it.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.045" offset="883545">As a practical matter, the vessel couldn't go up the river to the port to discharge and everyone was required to stay on the vessel until pratique was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.840" offset="918758">This is a form of clearance to establish that the crew is healthy, meets the quarantine requirements and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.899" offset="955016">On February 13th, pratique was granted and the vessel proceeded up the river to Saigon, a trip of some seven hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.637" offset="985945">There up from the 15th cargo discharge was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.466" offset="1001200">And on the 17th, the respondent, in the company of 17 other men asked to be sign off articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.743" offset="1034324">They were referred to the U.S. Consul who was acting in that court in the capacity of shipping commissioner which is customarily inform ports when the seaman leave the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.951" offset="1083225">The men were given a payroll voucher which outlined the earnings, the base wages and overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.004" offset="1123349">This was certified by the consul and the men were given transportation to return to the United States, a dispute arose at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.007" offset="1151352">The men wanted to be paid off in cash because of the situation in South Vietnam and the currency situation, U.S. currency was not given to the men.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.578" offset="1193671">They were allowed $50 to use for expenses incidental perhaps to travel home.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.331" offset="1224704">Because of the dispute that arose, the men respondent included Mr. Kline.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.579" offset="1245706">They left the next day and based on the testimony of the respondent in his pre-trial deposition, he arrived in Galveston on or about the 19th of February.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.955" offset="1291160">For reasons of his own convenience I assumed, he didn't report to the company agent until the 22nd of February when he was given cash as certified to in the voucher.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.767" offset="1342464">It is his claim that this was wrong, he shouldn't been paid off more expeditiously that this was a violation of Section 596.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.435" offset="1385096">The failure to give him his overtime wages was likewise a failure to pay earn wages even though they have been disallowed by the department head on the vessel in accordance to terms and provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.774" offset="1446431">Further, he was claiming because the 11 days when pratique had not been granted at the anchorage of Cap St. Jacques, that he was unjustifiably restricted to the ship and it was entitled additional eight days or rather 11 days of overtime, eight hours a day, as a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.434" offset="1517066">It gets somewhat confusing in analyzing the claim for penalties due to it appears that at one point in the complaint filed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.215" offset="1544234">There is a claim of double a day's pay as provided for in Section 596 as the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.233" offset="1572342">On top of the penalty, overtime not paid the rather claim for restriction to ship but not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.200" offset="1604211">Now, our position in essence is this, that all of the claims that have been presented here are based on the terms and provision to collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.895" offset="1642977">And in the collective-bargaining agreement, there is a procedure for presenting grievances, a procedure for arbitration and it has been the position of the petitioner that at least in the first instance based on the decision of this Court, he is required to pursue those procedures to get the remedy available if he is entitle rather than going to court and start a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.538" offset="2389556">If the money itself is due and concededly due and the company just arbitrarily refuses the pay it, I think the man then has of cause under 596 because the contract doesn't go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.507" offset="2437413">But before you can even get to anything like that of arbitrary upon payment, one has to first determine that something is due and this is not been done and that's where I believe that it's very important that grievance procedure be pursued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.203" offset="4348217">Mr. Arguelles, the respondent in this case returned to Galveston which was at port of Saigon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.385" offset="4380923">If I understand, his testimony in the pre-trial deposition ordinarily signed the ship out of Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.933" offset="4407150">And in going to the Union agent, in Galveston, I think the first problem perhaps was to resolve this question of the restriction to ship and whether it was justified and the best man to determine is, are given the information on the conditions of Saigon and that this anchorage where the ship was held would be the Port Agent in Yokohama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.222" offset="4496280">Now, in writing to him, they would get perhaps an authoritative expression on whether the restriction of the ship was in fact a condition of matter and whether the basis of his claim that he was entitled to eight hours a day overtime for those 11 days when they couldn't get off the ship was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.416" offset="4577050">The idea of him writing to the agent would allow an opportunity for the reply from Japan come back to Mr. Arguelles at Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.059" offset="4607561">He apparently not living in Galveston and not regularly shipping out of Galveston made it base of operations in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.776" offset="4638490">And in any event, under that Article II, Section 2 of the collective-bargaining agreement that he was dissatisfied with that advice, it says as you read down that he was entitled to a further merit of the Head Office of the Union if he didn't want to follow the advice of the agent in Galveston which apparently he didn't do, but he didn't do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.264" offset="4720410">He went back Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.396" offset="4725008">He engaged counsel and ultimately brought this law suit which gave rise to the problems we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.579" offset="4765654">Now, again, I go back to the decisions of this Court in similar problems in other industries and it seems that in the following the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 Section 301 (a) that it is desirable to have these things resolved between the companies and the Union in accordance with their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.646" offset="4877981">And I think perhaps one thing that disturbed the Fourth Circuit more than anything else was the time-honored concept that it seems is award of the (Inaudible) and therefore a person to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.911" offset="4931062">But in these instances you have on one side a very powerful Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.672" offset="4950079">You have a very effective labor management relations system working in the maritime industry and it seems that at least to make an exception in this type situation to let the parties to the agreement endeavor to work this out and I think they're best qualified to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.744" offset="5046314">Now, as in the Maddox case and the Vaca versus Sipes case decision to this Court, it was suggested that the effort they made to resolve in the court's grievance procedure before litigation would be resorted to and perhaps, that is what you had mind Mr. Justice Blackmun that did he get a fair treatment, adequate treatment to the hands of his Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.158" offset="5168044">I think what he did here; he didn't give the Union really a chance to take the matter up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.322" offset="5200645">I think he just dropped it when he said, right Yokohama, he didn't take any further and I think he should've.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.682" offset="5222066">He eventually engaged counsel and the counsel was certainly been qualified to take the matter up form with the Union and that wasn't done instead he started a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.074" offset="5263653">And really in granting summary judgment to District Court, I think the District Court judge reach the conclusion, there is really no dispute on this point that he didn't pursue the grievance and arbitration procedures that's why to summary judgment was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.523" offset="5333452">Now, today again with shipping industry operating all over the world, men leading ships engaged in foreign ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.397" offset="5384965">I think uniform procedures are most important and you should have a system on which everyone may rely and expect to have a certain amount of predictability in the result which is why it becomes important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.990" offset="5443375">I believe, to follow the grievance procedure and the arbitration procedure set up in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.146" offset="5467930">This is what they wanted to do and this is what would best serve the needs of the industry generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.524" offset="5497501">We're trying to strengthen our American Merchant Marines what remains important factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.479" offset="5529266">Mr. Gibson, the Secretary of State for Commerce recently at the International Labor Organization meeting in Geneva was quoted to saying, “That the American seaman today enjoy the highest wages of all seaman in the world and have better living conditions and working condition on the ship because the free atmosphere of collective-bargaining.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.922" offset="5631039">I think it's a desirable result to uphold the agreement and that basis which the parties of the agreement wanted to utilize to resolve their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.037" offset="5671476">Litigation is always there as the last resort, but really that's what it should be a last resort, first effort should be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.246" offset="5748381">I would like just to say a few additional facts here before going in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.105" offset="5779832">I would like to point out that the statute provides that in the foreign voyage, the seaman is entitled to be paid off within 24 hours after the cargo was discharged or within four days after he is discharged and for not doing so, the ship is liable for two days' pay for each day of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.089" offset="5887770">I beg your pardon sir?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1447.723" offset="5894248">That was no question.</text>

            <label>Mr. I. Duke Avnet</label>
            <text syncTime="1449.258" offset="5900413">And that the wages should be recoverable “as wages in any claim made before the court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.037" offset="5931551">Then there's another Section 597 which provides that were a seaman asked for a draw in any port, he must be paid a portion of his wages due, a third, otherwise the whole amount becomes due and he entitled to be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.780" offset="5994454">Now, in this case Mr. Arguelles, the seaman went first to Saigon during the six-month period of the shipping articles, and then went back to Taiwan to take on another cargo and the six months was about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.664" offset="6082017">And one day before the six-month period that is on February 2, 1966, Mr. Arguelles asked the Captain to be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.126" offset="6123917">The Captain said, no and he said, “Well I'd like my draw” and the Captain said, “no.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.450" offset="6153174">Reading between the lines, it is obvious here that the Captain did not wish to lose Mr. Arguelles and intended to keep beyond the six-month period of his articles knowing that by the time the ship drop to Saigon or near Saigon that the six months would have be expired and it's still have the services of Mr. Arguelles even though Mr. Arguelles no longer want to serve beyond the six-month period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.386" offset="6288906">When the vessel arrived in Cap St. Jacques which was on the third, the day the articles expired, he again asked to be discharged and be paid off and again it was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.196" offset="6332165">Now, assuming that the ship was not granted clearance that is that the crew was not granted surely, there was no objection apparently to the agent coming aboard with an American counsel if necessary so that the man who want to get paid off and his articles had expired could be paid off, but the Captain didn't want that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.805" offset="6406562">Apparently, reading between the lines, he wants to keep that crew on that ship or maybe it's because he couldn't get replacements or was difficult to get replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.340" offset="6444701">But be that is not made this violated the articles so far as Mr. Arguelles is concerned because he was there only on six-month articles and there were forced of keeping him there beyond that.</text>
