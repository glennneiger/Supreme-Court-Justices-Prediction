            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments in number 44, Precunier against Atchley.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert R. Granucci</label>
            <text syncTime="18.479" offset="177298">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.401" offset="196942">This is another chapter, and we hope the final chapter, in a story of a criminal prosecution that commenced in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.792" offset="234559">This case comes here after the United States District Court in a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ordered the State of California to hold a new hearing in the State Courts on the question of whether Atchley’s confession was voluntarily given, which confession was introduced to this trial over objection and a lengthy hearing at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.431" offset="353050">The question have been reviewed and affirmed by Unite-- by a unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of California and the decisions of the State Courts which were, adverse to Atchley, brought to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.132" offset="423894">I think the issue that is really presented today is whether a State Supreme Court decision on the merits of a federal claim in a criminal case can be given a presumption of correctness in Federal Habeas Corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.668" offset="486066">Now, if the answer to that question is in the negative, then the state appellate review of federal constitutional claims in criminal cases is an utter waste of time for everyone concerned, and State Appellate Courts would be well advised to relegate criminal defendants to the Criminal Courts for the immediate litigation of their constitutional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.068" offset="595675">Now, by way of procedural background, Atchley was convicted of murder in January 1959, after a jury trial in the Superior Court for Butte County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.864" offset="646875">Because he was sentenced to death, and incidentally that sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment and then commuted again to allow him the possibility of parole for which he is presently eligible, his appeal to the California State Supreme Court was automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.081" offset="727646">That Court affirmed the conviction in a unanimous opinion authored by then Associate Justice Traynor, to which we will refer in some detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.233" offset="772263">Suffice to say at this point, the principal issue raised by Atchley on his state appeal was whether his confession was voluntarily made.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.407" offset="809044">The California Supreme Court concluded that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.852" offset="826807">Atchley then came to this Court on a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.120" offset="851884">Briefs were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.325" offset="856691">The record was filed and the case was argued but after hearing argument and examining the record of the state proceedings, this Court dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.017" offset="903398">Shortly thereafter, Atchley filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.625" offset="933909">This was denied summarily, and the denial was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.659" offset="965987">In 1967, Atchley filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.716" offset="1018232">That petition challenged the admission into evidence of a tape recorded confession which he had given to his friend, an insurance agent, one Ray Travers, the same issue that had been presented to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.867" offset="1082807">The District Court granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.537" offset="1097540">It did not say that Atchley’s confession was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.186" offset="1116139">Indeed, the Court admitted that it could not say that Atchley’s confession was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.339" offset="1140694">The District Court avoided the necessity of passing on that issue by holding that the procedure followed in the State Trial Court was not fully adequate to achieve a reliable determination that Atchley’s confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.645" offset="1201925">By the order of the District Court, we are relegated to the State Courts for a further hearing on this issue with the possibility of further appeals in the State and Federal Courts, and Atchley loses again.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.303" offset="1252603">We say that the District Court erred in refusing to apply the presumption of correctness contained in Title 28 United States Code Section 2254 (d) which was enacted in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.433" offset="1321148">The Trial Court re-- the District Court refused to apply the presumption for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.461" offset="1341210">One, the District Court concluded that a clear-cut determination of voluntariness did not appear on the State Court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.614" offset="1377782">Secondly, the District Court stated that the Trial Court had applied an erroneous legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.355" offset="1404844">We respectfully submit that the District Court was wrong for three distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.597" offset="1437759">First, there was a definite ruling on the merits of Atchley’s constitutional claim in both the Trial Court and the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.275" offset="1484466">The District Court totally ignored the independent review of the California Supreme Court, focused its attention on the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.845" offset="1510797">It was wrong in both instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.102" offset="1519783">First of all, as regard to Trial Court, I point out that California is a jurisdiction that adheres to the Massachusetts or Humane Rule in determining the admissibility of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.112" offset="1571819">That is to say, the question of voluntariness is one that is to be determined, first of all, by the trial judge and, if the trial judge finds the confession voluntarily made, the confession is again submitted-- is submitted to the jury for a second albeit redundant determination of the voluntariness question.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.365" offset="1664815">This Court, in Jackson versus Denno and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Black, has indeed recognized that California does follow the Massachusetts or Humane Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.728" offset="1718314">Now, Atchley had a ruling on the voluntariness of his confession when the Trial Court, over objection, allowed the confession to go to the jury on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.413" offset="1784978">While the Trial Court did not give detail and specific instructions on the question of voluntariness to the jury, this is unnecessary for purposes of federal review, because all that Jackson d-- versus Denno requires is that the trial judge make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.740" offset="1854360">When that is done, the question of whether to submit the matter to the jury for a second determination is solely one of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.080" offset="1899708">So, there were complaints with Jackson versus Denno in the Trial Court and there was also a definite ruling on the merits by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.292" offset="1940564">That Court exercised the power of independent review and found the confession voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.092" offset="1979747">Now, the District Court, we submit, erred in holding that the material facts were not fully developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.585" offset="2009736">Each of the alleged inadequacies relied on by the District Court in the development of the facts can be answered by an examination of the straight-- state trial record and the opinion of the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.752" offset="2074415">First of all, the fact that Atchley was trying to contact a particular attorney in San Jose, and this is a point that the District Court said wasn’t sufficiently explored, well this was brought out in the trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.360" offset="2140766">It was considered by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.750" offset="2158320">In this case, the record also showed that Atchley was not an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.936" offset="2179114">He was a man who ran a used car business, speculated in small parcels of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.849" offset="2206804">He had an access to-- he had access to the telephone while he was under arrest, and he had retained local attorneys to carry on some civil litigation in connection with his business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.182" offset="2264064">In any event, Atchley spontaneously confessed to a third party, and that is why, even if there was a clear-cut showing of denial of counsel, it would have little, if any, weight under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.789" offset="2334490">California Supreme Court also considered the point and, moreover, Escobedo, which was a first decision by this Court to specifically make a request for counsel and the denial thereof determinative in a confession case, Escobedo is not retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.432" offset="2437099">The second point that the District Court said was inadequately developed was Travers’ concealment from Atchley of his motives for having a second conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.256" offset="2484433">Now, I would point out, although it’s spelled out in great detail in the briefs, I would point out for the illumination of the Court at this point that there were two conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.225" offset="2540231">About two days after he was arrested, Mr. Atchley called his insurance agent, one Ray Travers.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.942" offset="2567189">He called him down to the jail to talk about the circumstances of his insurance, the changes that resulted from his condition of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.136" offset="2603865">Now at that time, spontaneously, without any involvement of law enforcement, Atchley admitted to Travers that he had fired the shots that killed his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.880" offset="2678888">Travers reported this to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.469" offset="2693204">The police asked Travers if he would go back and get a second statement from Atchley that they would tape record.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.817" offset="2722670">He agreed to do so because, and this appears in the record, he had told Atchley that he was coming back to get further information in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.798" offset="2758614">Now, it’s a second of these statements-- the second statement that was tape recorded, that was at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.621" offset="2797902">In any event, the Supreme Court reviewed this matter of deception and held that this would not make a statement involuntary because it was not the sort of deception that would be likely to produce an untrustworthy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.322" offset="2860701">Third, the District Court said that the fact that Atchley did not know that the conversation would be recorded, that this wasn’t adequately developed, but it was in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.352" offset="2912737">It was considered by the California Supreme Court, and Atchley’s lack of knowledge of this point would hardly put on any pressure on him to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.780" offset="2954533">Finally-- no, fourth, what the officers said to Travers, again, this was relied on by the District Court, but this wasn’t material to Atchley’s state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.730" offset="2998314">There’s no question that Travers was acting on behalf of law enforcement at the time the second confession was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.720" offset="3026213">We don’t deny that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.115" offset="3035826">Fifth evidence of his mental condition, says the District Court, was not adequately developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.540" offset="3061530">But, Atchley did not offer evidence of his state of mind at the time he made the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.875" offset="3082846">His offer of proof is the state of mind at his trial when only to the time of the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.373" offset="3116910">The District Court also said that Atchley should’ve been allowed to develop proof of his education, his limited background.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.086" offset="3147734">Well, the Trial Court, when the prosecution objected to this t-- the proof of this nature, overruled the prosecution objection and allowed defense counsel to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.127" offset="3211891">However, the reason this point wasn’t developed is that defense counsel went on to another line of inquiry, and that appears at 147.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.619" offset="4353860">Second big difference between Townsend versus Sain in 2254 (d) is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.604" offset="4481755">In other words, it turns-- the section, if you will, turns the authorization of Townsend versus Sain into an actual requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.145" offset="4519999">Also, the petitioner is given the burden of showing that the criteria for the adequacy of State Courts hearings are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.915" offset="4563048">A second further distinction is that 3354 (d) changed the burden of proof in habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.137" offset="4599933">Now, traditionally, as in all civil cases, the burden of proof in a habeas corpus case was on the petitioner, but it was proof by a preponderance of the evidence only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.449" offset="4657194">2254 (d) says that where the criteria are satisfied, proof must be made by clear and convincing evidence, obviously, a higher standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.093" offset="4715708">We think the District Court erred for the further reason that it totally ignored, in its order, the effect of the independent review afforded actually by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.455" offset="4769207">Just as this Court does in confession cases, the Appellate Courts of the State of California afford independent review in confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.287" offset="4812570">Therefore, the decision of the California Supreme Court should have been afforded a presumption of correctness separate and apart from that given the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.248" offset="4856351">Now, we think it’s quite reasonable, given the policy behind Section 2254 (d), to apply it to the opinions of State Appellate Courts when they consider claims on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.472" offset="4909223">Obviously, 2254 (d) refers to “a determination after the hearing on the merits of a factual issue, and while this section obviously contemplates a determination by a trial judge after a hearing, it ought not to be confined to that meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.159" offset="7935979">I do not believe that state appellate review can ever perform the function of the fact finding that’s required by this Court and required by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.575" offset="7977671">The first point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.680" offset="7986134">In state appellate review, you have a principle of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.500" offset="8005360">Now, the states says it’s an initial review, but it is still an initial review based with a substantial evidence rule, and I cite for that a 1970 case by the California Supreme Court that defines the scope of its appellate review of confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.130" offset="8075891">This is People versus Randall cited in 1 Cal 3rd 948, and I wish to quote from page 954 of that opinion just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.536" offset="8125524">“on this appeal, we accept the version of the events which is most favorable to the people, to the extent it is supported by record, and confine our review beyond such testimony to facts which are uncontradicted by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.818" offset="8190621">I submit, Your Honors, that by any proper definition, that is a substantial evidence rule, and that substantial evidence rule had its impact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.023" offset="8227506">Because of Your Honors’ review, the language of the State Court opinion, you will find that the facts are essentially the facts that were stated in the recorded confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.315" offset="8320606">However, I am here to state the point in comparing state appellate review versus a fact finding process which we-- what believe is required on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.529" offset="8361462">That, this is an example of how it works that, the state picks up in its opinion those facts which are most favorable to the people, assuming of course that there had been a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.922" offset="8403048">Now, you combine that substantial evidence rule with a harmless error rule on appeal, and this is exactly what happened to Mr. Atchley in this case. The California Supreme Court says he didn’t have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.502" offset="8453413">That was error for the judge to stop that testimony, but it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.829" offset="8474728">So, you have a substantial evidence rule, you have a harmless error rule, and of course you have the fact also that the Appellate Courts have no facility for taking evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.508" offset="8669393">That’s what I’m replying to and what I’m stating are the reasons why state appellate review can be no substitute for a fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.395" offset="8708995">I believe this Court has said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.188" offset="8720175">In Jackson against Denno, it said when facts are important, appellate review is an inadequate substitute for a Trial Court hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.241" offset="8764374">If there is going to be examination into the constitutionality of convictions, there has to be the fact finding process so that matters that are extraneous to the record can be brought in so that they can be a value, so their constitutional significance can be weighed, and I don’t believe that the state court-- appellate opinion could ever satisfy that function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.940" offset="9267179">Now, this case-- this Court has devoted a great deal of time and attention in past decisions to its confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.927" offset="9295078">It’s expressed itself time and again the importance of confession cases to the administration of justice, and it has also gone to the point of making its confession cases retroactive, which is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.705" offset="9350144">With respect to the right to an attorney, some references were made by the state’s attorney to whether Mr. Atchley had access to one or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.714" offset="9386193">We believe that the record is patently clear and, in fact, undenied that he requested a lawyer and did not receive one.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_legge" startTime="2717.369" stopTime="2934.865">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Legge</label>
            <text syncTime="2717.369" offset="10972871">That’s quite true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.400" offset="10976946">That’s quite true, but I don’t think that the mere passage of time should have the effect of eliminating constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.778" offset="11010487">We have-- this Court has a certain control over that also in connection with the decisions which it decides to make retroactive and those which it does not make retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.784" offset="11066493">And, it is declared that it is Johnson v.-- or it’s Jackson v. Denno decisions are going to be retroactive in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.155" offset="11104005">So, we think once the Court has said that, that just passage of years, the number of years that have passed is not enough to eliminate the existence of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.649" offset="11157922">Your Honor, I would reply to one further argument made by the state, and that is in connection with the Jackson versus Denno principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.686" offset="11202121">The state makes the argument that the trial judge’s near admission of this confession into evidence constituted enough of a ruling upon the subject of voluntariness to satisfy the requirements of Jackson v. Denno.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.914" offset="11270980">We would first point out, Your Honors, that the introduction of the confession into evidence was not enough in the Sims case, Sims against Georgia, was not enough in Boles against Stevenson, and was not enough in Parker versus Sigler to constitute rulings by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.350" offset="11344750">It’s sort of a fortiori to the Boles versus Stevenson decision because, at that decision, the procedure followed in that is a so-called orthodox procedure where the jury has no function in finding voluntariness at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.844" offset="11398771">I would also cite to the Court, in that regard, that Sims required unmistakable clarity of a ruling by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.580" offset="11441716">Now here, however, the argument-- the decision in ruling made by the trial judge was all tied in with the evidence-- with 20 pages of evidentiary material and, we submit, could only be confusing at the utmost when admitted into evidence before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.525" offset="11521442">Now, Your Honors, there’s another element to the case which we think is significant and is important, and that is the inducement underlying this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.030" offset="11575463">There is the fact that the reason why Mr. Travers was talking to Mr. Atchley was that he needed facts for purposes of insurance coverage set on page 100, and this is a portion of the transcribed conversation between Travers and Atchley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.696" offset="11658115">Mr. Travers says, “Boy oh boy, you got your cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.281" offset="11676505">I got to write this up to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.924" offset="11687058">We got to think of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.934" offset="11695104">I want this information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.034" offset="11703463">And then, he proceeds with his interrogation of Mr. Atchley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.756" offset="11718405">Again, on page 102 of the record, Tarvers says “I say, 100% as far as the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.090" offset="11747767">I am almost positive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.549" offset="11757589">So, this Court has said many times that a confession cannot be the product of any inducement at all, and I think here, Your Honor, that the inducement is very specific, “insurance money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.517" offset="11821432">Now, what consequences should flow from all of this?</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.638" offset="11857899">Yes, page 102 and page 100 of the-- what I just quoted are from the recoding of the conversation, that is the so-called confession that is in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.213" offset="11924250">The consequences, Your Honor, that we think should flow from all of these are this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.487" offset="11945357">We, first of all, respectfully submit that because of the denial of counsel in this case, that this confession should be determined to be involuntary as a matter of law and that Mr. Atchley should be accorded a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.388" offset="12008887">We believe that the Court has come close to this, if not actually doing it, in its decisions in the Greenwald and Darwin case, and we believe that it has in fact done it in the Massiah decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.092" offset="12063744">The Spano decision, of course, is quite relevant to it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.230" offset="12080253">We feel that when these two interests of protecting against involuntary confessions with the right to counsel come together that that, in it of itself, should be enough for a confession to be involuntary as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.290" offset="12140544">In addition, of course, to the absence of an attorney, as we point out in our brief, there are numerous other factors involved in this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.234" offset="12172309">He was not being advised of his rights, the inducement of the insurance money, his personal intelligence, or I should say lack of intelligence and capacity to resist, and the other factors mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.843" offset="12222777">Now, at the very least, Your Honors, because of the procedural inequities in that the State Court hearing on a confession, we believe that the District Court should be affirmed and that Atchley should be given the evidentiary hearing which the District Court said he should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.825" offset="12302712">So we believe, Your Honors, that confession is either involuntary as a matter of law and should result in a new trial or, at the very least, that Mr. Atchley should be given the evidentiary hearing in the State Courts that was awarded to him by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.746" offset="13066324">Moreover, the counsel point was considered as a circumstance by the California Supreme Court in assessing the voluntariness of a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.039" offset="13107493">Now, counsel argues that state appellate review is not comparable to federal habeas corpus because of the substantial evidence rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.607" offset="13161827">That, in a state appellate practice, the substantial evidence rule does not come into play at all until there has been an original determination of procedural fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.993" offset="13215326">In other words, where the procedural fairness of the hearing itself is challenged, counsel-confrontation, that sort of thing, where those things are challenged, substantial evidence can’t be determined until the procedural questions are answered and this is roughly analogous to what Congress has provided in 2254 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.337" offset="13300694">In other words, state hearings are to be given finality where the State Courts have afforded substantial procedural fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.718" offset="13342281">It was a step in the direction of what Professor Bator proposed in his law review article which we cite and refer to in our briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.138" offset="13403930">I would respectfully submit that, in the ultimate, the ultimate determination is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.046" offset="13439561">We live in a federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.832" offset="13454712">This case gives the Court an opportunity to show that federalism is a two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.102" offset="13479790">State Courts are required to apply federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.819" offset="13522631">The obligation of the states to apply the constitution ought to call forth from this Court a corresponding grant of confidence in the State Courts to apply it correctly.</text>
