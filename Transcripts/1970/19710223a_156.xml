            <text syncTime="38.381" offset="256920">In this case, an alien who has been an overstayed temporary visitor in the United States since 1965, claims a right to remain under a statute which grants special benefits to refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.642" offset="325987">The issue concerns the construction of Section 203 (a) (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which affords a haven for refugees who have been -- who are fled persecution in communist countries, who are unwilling or unable to return and who are not nationals of the country or area in which their application is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.857" offset="438836">Respondent unquestionably fled communist China in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.507" offset="469452">However, like hundreds of thousands of others, his flight stopped at Hong Kong where he was granted generous residence privileges, established a home, was married and had a child and continued to live for seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.883" offset="558895">In 1959, respondent came to the United States for the first time as a temporary visitor for business.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.536" offset="985527">Immediately, the respondent filed an application for benefits under a proviso to Section 203 (a) (7) which grants refugee benefits to refugees who have lived in this country for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.342" offset="1060760">That application was denied by the immigration and District Director by the Regional Commissioner on the ground that the respondent was no longer a refugee since he had established -- firmly established a residence and a home in Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.817" offset="1126588">He then sought judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.103" offset="1139754">The District Court ruled in his favor, finding that he had not been from the resettle in Hong Kong because of this allegation that he have never intended to remain their permanently and that he harbored an intention to come to the United States at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.452" offset="1209135">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.141" offset="1219897">They found, the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.207" offset="1232227">The Ninth Circuit found that the question of whether he was firmly resettled was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.445" offset="1261171">The court said that under the statute, once respondent had been a refugee, he was entitled to its benefits even though he had established a stable new home in another country.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.847" offset="1354794">That conclusion incidentally is opposed by the later decision of the Second Circuit in Shen against Esperdy which is reported in 428 F. 2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.889" offset="1402964">Now admittedly, Section 203 (a) (7) of the statute does not contain a specific disqualification of refugees who have been firmly resettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.981" offset="1451342">But I believe that the purpose to exclude them, clearly appears if we examine the history and the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.502" offset="1497422">After World War II, the United States became deeply concerned with the massive problems presented by millions of refugees’ leftover from that war and it developed temporary programs to deal with those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.076" offset="1571715">These programs were reflected in a series of measures adopted from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.731" offset="1598255">The first of these, the major -- the first major statute was the Displaced Persons Act of 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.575" offset="1629706">Under this statute in a three-and-a-half year period, the United States received approximately 400,000 refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.948" offset="1667114">That statute did have specific language disqualifying refugees who are permanently, firmly resettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.199" offset="1700133">The next major statute was the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 under which, approximately 200,000 refugees were received into the United States and again, these statutes specifically excluded refugees who had been permanently resettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.115" offset="1775783">After that, the next statute was the Refugee Act of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.448" offset="1797204">This was a temporary statute again for a limited purpose, and the purpose was to assign approximately 18,000 visas that had been unused when the Refugee Relief Act had expired at the end of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.514" offset="1865435">The 1957 law said that these visas should be assigned to a group known as refuge escapees and in designating that group, it did not mention firm resettlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.604" offset="1925831">The next of these temporary statutes was the so called Fair Share Act of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.070" offset="1955610">Now, this again was a temporary measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.906" offset="1967000">It was designed to enable the United States to participate in a worldwide movement to enable the United Nations to close the remaining refugee camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.779" offset="2018513">And under the terms of this statute, the United States undertook to receive what it considered its fair share of these refugees in the camps; 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.053" offset="2067623">Now again, this statute said nothing about refugees who had been firmly resettled.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.164" offset="2187995">In 1960 – 1959, the United Nations undertook a concerted drive to close these camps and the United States cooperated with that movement in so called world refugee year and adopted the 1960 law as part of that movement.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.050" offset="2259571">These were not -- this law was not concerned with the refugee camps in the Middle East?</text>

            <text syncTime="545.123" offset="2283813">No, specifically not because the United Nations mandate to which it was tied did not apply to the Middle East.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.954" offset="2319235">Again as I said, this law, the 1960 law did mention firm resettlement, and it did add language which excluded or which decreed that it would not apply to those who were nationals of the country in which their application was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.985" offset="2399274">Now from these developments, the Ninth Circuit took the position, came to the conclusion that because of this chain of events and the changes in the language of the statute, Congress had intended to make a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.880" offset="2474924">In the language of the court, this was a clear manifestation of congressional intent to change the criteria.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="603.483" stopTime="726.494">
            <label>Mr. Charles Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="603.483" offset="2517347">Two things; one is in the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 and in it predecessor, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, there was specific language barring refugees who had been from the resettlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.691" offset="2582131">Second, in the 1960 Fair Share Law, there was new language saying that its benefits would not apply to those who are nationals of the country in which the application was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.537" offset="2641481">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that this addition of the language “not a national” was intended to be a substitution for the criterion of those firmly resettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.040" offset="2695502">Now, no legislative history is cited by the Court of Appeals to support this conclusion, and I would suppose that if Congress had intended such a marked departure from the previously established procedures, criteria, it would have expressed its purpose in some clear manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.882" offset="2778885">Yet, nowhere in the legislative history is there any indication that a change was contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.634" offset="2805948">Moreover, the Second Circuit in a very careful and a very long and detailed opinion, studied the legislative history in much more detail and let’s say than the Ninth Circuit, they came to the conclusion that no change had been intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.387" offset="2884942">I think the 1957 law furnishes the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.511" offset="2901452">The 1957 law was the first law which changed the language, which eliminated the firmly resettlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.107" offset="2931754">But in the House report, reporting this legislation, and you recall Your Honors, this legislation was intended to take care of a group leftover from the previous law, the House Committee said they intended that in applying this law, the same criteria should be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.186" offset="3000090">So, it seems obvious that no change was intended.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="740.710" stopTime="966.292">
            <label>Mr. Charles Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="740.710" offset="3066232">And of course, we agree with the Second Circuit, but I think that as I develop my argument, I think that the history of this legislation indicates quite decisively that these statutes are intended to deal with homeless people, to provide the haven for a homeless into this place.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.471" offset="3137285">Now, I believe the “not a national language” which was inserted for the first time in 1960 had an entirely different purpose from that envisaged by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.575" offset="3185664">The court, unlike the Second Circuit which is I say considered this with great care, the court below overlooked the fact that the 1960 Act was tied to the mandate of the United Nations, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.530" offset="3257448">The mandate of the High Commissioner, which is incorporated in a U.N. statute specifically declares, among other things, that his mandate shall not extend to refugees situated in the country of their nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.287" offset="3324531">So in adopting the criteria of the United Nations Congress followed that formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.872" offset="3350862">Now when that formulation was carried over into the 1965 Act, which succeeded these laws, I believe Congress had in mind the change in world conditions that had occurred by that time, in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.920" offset="3415019">In the original refugee laws, Congress confronted a world, Europe particularly that was shattered by war.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.696" offset="3446157">The countries of Europe, even the countries which were receiving their own nationals were unable to care for such nationals and therefore, the United States pitched in and helped.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.761" offset="3498402">And in the earlier refugee laws, there was specific provision for the reception of Greek, Dutch, German and other ethnic refugees who were situated in the country of their nationality, Italian I believe is the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.428" offset="3577083">Now, by the time the 1965 law was being considered, the situations as I said had changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.925" offset="3603101">Congress I believe concluded that these nations were now able to care for their own refugees and therefore, it inserted this proviso that it would not extend to refugees who were in their own countries, the countries of their nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.665" offset="3670079">Now particularly, I call Your Honors' attention to the situation of West Germany, which may have been in the mind of Congress, which previously had been the beneficiary of all the refugee laws which had been previously enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.026" offset="3735489">By the application of the “not a national” proviso, Congress apparently were saying that since Germany had now fully recovered, the ethnic German refugees who are coming into Germany could be cared for by their own country, and it was no longer necessary for the United States to pitch in and help.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.744" offset="3814379">I think, this is the basis for the adoption by Congress of the “not a national” proviso and it seems to me completely without warrant to assume that Congress intended to utilize this special statutory provision for the aid of refugees who didn’t need immediate help, who were not homeless, who were not displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.937" offset="3911137">Our briefs recite the consistent administrative interpretation which has found that benefit under these refugees statutes are not available to refugees who have become settled and stabled new homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.694" offset="4006118">Incidentally, now that I’ve interrupted you, is there any distinction in immigration law terminology between the term national and the term citizenship?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="986.248" offset="4048332">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.944" offset="4051153">It’s a slight difference in the present practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.487" offset="4065364">National is a person owning permanent allegiance, includes citizens, it’s a broader term than citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.731" offset="4094307">As used in our context today, I think it’s synonymous with citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.728" offset="4122311">Now as I’ve said, the administrative interpretation is consistently upheld the view on arguing here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.125" offset="4151881">For example, when the 1957 Act was adopted, the state department immediately promulgated regulations which announced the firmly resettled concept even though the law hadn’t said anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.439" offset="4217083">In addition, a series of reported administrative decisions have expressed that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.853" offset="4246758">And finally, that concept has been reflected in reports which are made by the immigration service to Congress every six months showing the operations under Section 203 (a) (7) as required by Section 203 (f) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.217" offset="4316244">Now Congress has never questioned that interpretation and indeed, no court other than that court below has ever reached a contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.180" offset="4364100">Now, respondent seeks to find support for his interpretation in a statement made by Senator Kennedy during the course of the debate on the 1965 law in which Senator Kennedy said that Section 203 (a) (7) refugees and I quote "must be currently settled in countries other than their homelands."</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.946" offset="4455111">This statement was a small part in an explanation by Senator Kennedy of the many provisions of the 1965 law which primarily was adopted to abolish the national origin's coding system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.765" offset="4514461">I think Senator Kennedy was not addressing the concept, he didn’t say he was and it doesn’t appear that he was addressing the concept of firm resettlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.297" offset="4552600">In context and reading the statement in entirety, I think Senator Kennedy was speaking of providing homes for the homeless, for the displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.876" offset="4598888">And in our reply brief at page 6, we set forth some additional excerpts from Senator Kennedy’s statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.971" offset="4631280">For example, Senator Kennedy spoke of the need for this country to remain and I quote “a haven for the displaced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.492" offset="4673390">And that again and I quote “the cases of the greatest need can be processed at once.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.483" offset="4709334">Later in the floor debate, Senator Kennedy commented that the Bill, again I quote “establishes what we mean by refugees, those fleeing from communist dominations and from the other categories mentioned in the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.052" offset="4783626">I believe Senator Kennedy’s reference to those fleeing is an accurate paraphrase of the statutory requirement that speaks of those who have fled persecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.562" offset="7841625">And we say where an applicant qualifies under the literal terms of the statute, unless he’s become a national of intermediate country, he is eligible for consideration under the law.</text>
