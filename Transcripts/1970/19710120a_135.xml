            <text syncTime="231.509" offset="1029413">Also, we indicated that our sole client, our sole defense was First Amendment and I’ll call Your Honor’s attention to the Logan Valley case, the Food Employees versus Logan Valley case which arose in almost in identical factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.164" offset="1104018">I believe it was an interlocutory or temporary injunction which was considered final by this Court because it remained in effect until modified by the Court and the same is true as we’ve set out in our reply brief with respect to temporary injunctions under Illinois law.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.798" offset="1618526">The respondent Jerome Keefe is a real estate broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.892" offset="1630960">It has business in petitioner’s neighborhood in Austin and the OBA believed that his active solicitation of persons who lived in the neighborhood to sell their homes constituted,-- contributed to the rapid change over of portions of the community from integrated to all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.946" offset="1715179">In short, petitioners claim that respondent was a panic peddler.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.546" offset="1741511">In the OBA, at a meeting in Austin to which respondent cane asked questions to the respondent and asked him to sign on a solicitation agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.675" offset="1786023">Respondent refused and it’s following that refusal that the literature distribution in question here took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.383" offset="1832939">Some members of the OBA distributed literature by hand in the Westchester community in which the respondent lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.652" offset="1869928">The trial court made a finding with respect to this distribution after the evidentiary hearing which is as follows that the petitioner’s distribution of leaflets and I quote “was in all occasions conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner, did not caused any disruption of pedestrian or vehicular traffic and did not precipitate any fights, disturbances or other breaches of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.243" offset="1968358">This literature was distributed on five different occasions over a two-month period and it was distributed by leaving it at the doorsteps or in the handle of the screen door in various residence in respondent’s neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.801" offset="2034604">Unlike Martin v. Struthers, I might add parenthetically, no residents were summoned to the door to receive them and there are no complaints from these residents that they were in any way disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.755" offset="2078386">They were distributed at the shopping center and they were distributed in front of a church to which respondent says he belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.436" offset="2117151">However, irrespective of this finding that there was no disruption, no disturbance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.288" offset="2148498">The trial court have enjoined petitioners and I quote “from passing of pamphlets, leaflets or literature of any kind and from picketing anywhere in the City or Westchester, Illinois.”</text>
            <text syncTime="523.614" offset="2197817">This is the injunction which has been in effect now for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.934" offset="2215058">However, while refusing to enjoin picketing, peaceful picketing at respondent’s office in Austin, the trial court did enjoin all picketing in the City of Westchester and it did this absent any evidence that petitioners had engaged in any picketing in Westchester.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.389" offset="2296978">The Appellate Court of Illinois sustained its blanket injunction which the trial court had entered and came to the unprecedented conclusion in sustaining it that petitioners had no First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.391" offset="2356955">There were no First Amendment rights involved here and the appellate court justified this conclusion on two basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.143" offset="2391960">First, I quote, “the purpose of the defendants was not to inform the public of a matter of public interest but the sole purpose was to force plaintiff to sign a no-solicitation agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="583.844" offset="2438771">The Court did not consider relevant to its determination on this issue whether the subject of respondent’s real estate activities in a racially changing area was a matter of public interest or public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.709" offset="2498226">The appellate court also justified making Westchester off limits to petitioner’s distribution of leaflets on the basis of a determination that respondent’s right of privacy was invaded by this distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.436" offset="2553083">And finally, the appellate court held that the scope of this restraint namely everywhere in the city of 18,000 persons on both literature distribution and picketing, was not overly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.536" offset="2613478">I’d like to treat first that liberty which the Constitution has traditionally afforded to the peaceful and orderly distribution of literature by hand, the doctrine of no-prior restraint, then consider how the appellate court’s justification where its conclusion that the right free speech is not involved here, does not comport with the long history of decisions involving the First Amendment by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.511" offset="2773452">Historically, the liberty of press and freedom of speech has embraced pamphlets and leaflets as well as books and newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.470" offset="2813262">Leaflets distributed on streets and sidewalks, door-to-door and in shopping centers have been the backbone of political campaigns, religious evangelism, and have played a major role in the advocacy of social, political and economic causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.246" offset="2888391">Restraints such as imposed here on the distribution of non-commercial literature at such places have been uniformly held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.290" offset="2932485">In the past states who attempted to justify outright prohibition and various other less serious restraints in terms of the one here on a variety of grounds to prevent littering as the Schneider case because it’s unpopular, annoying or distasteful which is Murdoch because of privacy Martin v. Struther or the possibility of fraud which is Schneider and Talley.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.686" offset="3050141">The various restraints which have been held unconstitutional have included of course outright prohibition which is what is before the Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.544" offset="11165550">I believe the temporary order restricts only their physical presence in the community of Westchester.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.680" offset="11210062">I think one of the serious issues we have here is whether in contemporary America with our many confrontations, dissent, protest, that whether we will permit the residential neighborhood to become a part of the battlefield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.382" offset="11288952">It is certainly true that it is the effective place to fight the battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.864" offset="11306820">Men who could not be persuaded by reasoning, men who could not be deterred by economic pressures may certainly be forced by pressure placed upon their family life and their communal relations to take acts which they would not otherwise be willing to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.127" offset="11379858">I think we should consider and look at this case the heavy burden upon our public servants that who guide our cities in the urban problems that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.343" offset="11416743">It was not too long ago, this Court had before it the Gregory case which involved a march in the vicinity of Mayor Daley’s neighborhood and I think thought was given us to whether this type of activity should be encouraged or permitted which is so disruptive of family and neighborhood life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.368" offset="11492812">I think the activity here by the Organization for Better Austin, in so far as it was directed towards the community at which Mr. Keefe resides suffers from the same vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.887" offset="11558954">Indeed, I would say, it resembles here residential picketing which in every reported case, it has been concluded that residential picketing has either been enjoined, it has either been made the subject of a criminal sanction or administrative cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.247" offset="11640351">There is no reported case that I have been able to find and I refer also to Professor Kayman’s article on residential picketing in the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.343" offset="11776711">When you consider what residential picketing is, it’s not typical picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.131" offset="11791862">You are not trying to keep people from passing in or out of a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.629" offset="11809938">There’s not the element of intimidation at least in the reported cases but you have one or a group of people standing in front of someone’s home with some form of message usually of a derogatory nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.605" offset="11857795">Now, I see no particular difference as far as the homeowner is concerned between having someone stand in from of his home with a derogatory placard that can only be seen by his neighbors for the most part and going door-to-door with that same message and distributing to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.009" offset="11923414">So, I think the conduct of the Organization for Better Austin here is very analogous to what our residential picketing situations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.010" offset="11983391">The Court recently in the Rowland case, the head occasion to consider in a different context of course, but the fact that there is a light to be let alone which must be balanced with the right of others to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.313" offset="12032606">And I think we are faced again with a similar resolution of conflicting rights here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.291" offset="12264573">I might say parenthetically, the State of Illinois last December 15th has adopted a new Constitution which is part of its Bill of Rights has expressly provided for the right of privacy along with the -- as part of the search and seizure provision of the Act.</text>
