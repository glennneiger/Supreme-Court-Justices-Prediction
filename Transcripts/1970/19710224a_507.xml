            <text syncTime="35.869" offset="246888">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.183" offset="268100">This case comes to this Court on a direct appeal from the decision of a three-judge federal court in the Northern district of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.849" offset="322748">The facts of the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.164" offset="339989">Judith Java was working for a small newspaper in the town of Pittsburg California in August of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.155" offset="395995">During this employment, she stepped out one day at about noon with another reporter, went to a bar next to the newspaper office, stayed there for a while and returned to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.021" offset="475408">The managing editor of the newspaper observed that the reporter with Mrs. Java appeared to be drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.049" offset="515532">There was some exchange, the reporter was fired on the spot and Mrs. Java was also fired on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.848" offset="574777">Later when Mrs. Java applied for unemployment insurance benefits, she claimed that when she was in the bar, she had some tomato juice and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.090" offset="627754">The referee however found that she had alcoholic beverages, she smelled of alcohol, she was glassy eyed, she was staggered or speech was slurred and the referee in short believed the employer who maintained that that was the reason, he fired her for misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.164" offset="744051">After her employment was terminated, Mrs. Java applied for unemployment insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.952" offset="775189">She went to the unemployment insurance office, she had an interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.452" offset="793161">She was given some forms to fill out.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.284" offset="808521">She went home, came back some time later after the interviewer had a chance to verify whether she had sufficient wages in her base period.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.639" offset="865886">And a form was sent out to the employer for him to state his version of the facts and why she was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.535" offset="901517">It does not appear that this form was ever returned by the employer but when Mrs. Java returned for her eligibility interview, the interviewer listened to her and apparently contacted the employer and the interviewer believed Mrs. Java who was sitting right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.643" offset="977899">The interviewer believed she'd had tomato juice that there was not enough evidence otherwise and found in her favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.638" offset="1189909">I believe that the Court as you know decided this case on two grounds, on a conformity question, whether we're paying “when due,” and secondly on a due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.981" offset="1239333">It went on from the statutory ground then decided it on due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.376" offset="1256887">And I think that that is the more important issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.314" offset="1276635">I think that the “when due” problem, while it bears on due process is essentially a statutory problem which has been covered in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.756" offset="1710373">Well You Honor, the lower court found that the California procedure which suspends benefits to a claimant while the employer appeals was out of conformity with a provision of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Asher Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="463.546" offset="1957595">Well Your Honor, I believe we have to proceed to the constitutional question because the concept of whether with paying “when due” does involve some constitutional problems of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.474" offset="2025305">If you find that the -- on the statutory ground, if you reverse on the statutory ground, then it may simply mean that the Secretary of Labor should have the initial power to examine the California procedure and I'm not sure that this would totally dispose the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.181" offset="2136064">The lower court did go on to talk about the constitutional problem and we feel that it is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.437" offset="2165112">We should discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.083" offset="2183711">In any event Your Honor the question of whether we are inconformity with that with this Act and whether we make these payments “when due” is covered in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.787" offset="2226552">So, I think that here, we've got to look at Goldberg versus Kelly and determine whether this case is indistinguishable from that one or whether this one is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.186" offset="2292067">Whether Goldberg compels the decision that the District Court made or whether it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.553" offset="2325608">If the Court please, I believe that this course is -- this case is very different from Goldberg versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.178" offset="2356120">In the Goldberg situation firstly, you have only two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.869" offset="2374823">You have the state and you have the welfare claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.749" offset="2390392">In unemployment insurance, you have three parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.857" offset="2402826">You have the state, you have the claimant and you have the employer who pays for this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.801" offset="2430621">It's his contributions exclusively which pay the unemployment insurance benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Asher Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="590.447" offset="2465207">Well, Your Honor, the Federal Government pays the cost of administering the program but it's all traceable back to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.717" offset="2494255">He pays 90% of his contributions to the state and 10% go to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.622" offset="2517870">Out of that 10%, the Federal Government pays the cost of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.538" offset="2541484">So we have three parties here that we have to worry about.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.137" offset="2551933">We have the state, we have the claimant and we have the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.818" offset="2562696">And the employer interest wasn't present in Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.527" offset="2577429">Now, second ground of distinction is that in the Goldberg case, this Court was concerned about termination of benefits which had already been deemed with -- been ruled eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.663" offset="2626017">That is that the claimant had already been ruled eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.868" offset="2638869">There was no question in Goldberg about the initial eligibility of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.521" offset="2665409">The claimant was ruled eligible; the claimant was receiving welfare for a period of time and then came the abrupt termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.306" offset="2704593">In this case Your Honors, we maintain that the initial question of eligibility has not yet been made final.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.589" offset="2745762">On the very form that a claimant receives, notifying him of his eligibility, the form says, this determination is final unless an appeal is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.832" offset="2806680">It's our contention Your Honor and that appeal must be filed within 10 days of the initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.489" offset="2833324">It's our contention that all this is within the res gestae if you will, of the initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.636" offset="2873866">The fact that the interviewer has found this claim ineligible has not completed the initial finding of eligibility in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.111" offset="2907826">And this is we think the critical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.459" offset="2921200">The employer still has the right to request to be heard, to have an appeal, to have a hearing to present his views.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.658" offset="2954010">At that point Mr. Rubin, what is the fact of the employer's right to appear or be present at the interviewer's interview?</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.599" offset="6321716">Throughout this case, it has been our position that the reason that thousands of working people in California are denied unemployment benefits each year during the time in which they most need them is because they have been found eligible for unemployment benefits after a thorough investigation in which both sides have had a chance to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.417" offset="6413040">We believe that this denial of benefits after such a determination frustrates the fundamental purposes of the unemployment section of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.116" offset="6451806">Therefore we believe that this case can be decided on Federal Statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.401" offset="6468942">And that it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.672" offset="6550026">Then if an employer files an appeal, it takes in a median period of seven more weeks until that appeal is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.095" offset="6579702">So that in a case where claimant has been found eligible and an appeal is filed by an employer and benefits are cut off, usually after two payments, no further benefits are paid until -- over ten weeks after the claimant first walks in to the unemployment office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.093" offset="10583751">They saw people who realty couldn't work, old people, blind people, young people, disabled people and they also saw workers who couldn't find a job who may have been in an identical economic position and in fact this Court held and explained in Stewart and justifying the unemployment compensation law, the federal act that the Congress passed the Act because workers were starving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.338" offset="10680717">The Congress did not want to lump welfare recipients or lump non workers and workers into one program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.310" offset="10724603">And therefore what the Congress did was it set up a separate program for unemployed workers, that would pay them benefits at a particular point in time, they would work for these benefits, they would be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.497" offset="10765354">Hopefully they would find a new job rather quickly and then they would be off benefits.</text>
