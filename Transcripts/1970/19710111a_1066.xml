            <label>Mr. John W. Vardaman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.292" offset="144488">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.359" offset="160789">This case was previously before Your Honors on December 7, at which time the parties engaged in extensive oral argument on petitioner's application for stay to prevent the construction of a large six-lane interstate highway through Overton Park in Memphis Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.489" offset="241351">After hearing argument, the Court granted the stay, granted certiorari, set the case for argument on the merits today.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.978" offset="279280">As Your Honors will recall, this case arises under a federal statute, generally, referred to as Section 4 (f) of the Department of Transportation Act which provides that the Secretary of Transportation shall not approve a highway project which affects a public park such as Overton Park, unless there are no feasible and prudent alternative routes or unless the design includes all possible planning to minimize harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.524" offset="413445">As we pointed out in the argument on December the 7, there are all alternative routes to that through the park, there are all alternative designs which would minimize harm to the park, designs admittedly possible in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.906" offset="478960">We have alleged supported that the proper determinations which are required by Section 4 (f) of the Department of Transportation Act, were not made and indeed even if they were made, they were infirm or legally invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.031" offset="555447">Since this Court granted certiorari, there have been two important developments in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.610" offset="581778">Immediately thereafter, the Solicitor General on behalf of the Secretary, filed a motion to remand in which he conceded that the courts below had erred in granting and affirming summary judgment on the basis of affidavits which merely characterize documents on which these determinations, he said, had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.225" offset="676237">We certainly agree that the summary judgment was wrong, but we have oppose an immediate remand because of the other important issues which we believe should be decided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.105" offset="719809">The second important development which has occurred since we were here before, occurred approximately 10 minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.225" offset="752306">At that time, the Solicitor General handed me two pieces of paper, which purport to be affidavits which I understand he is attempting to file in this case at this time, one of which says that as an affidavit of Alan S. Boyd and which he says as a matter of fact that he did make the determination which we have alleged he did not make and which we have offered to prove that he did not make.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.230" offset="860244">The second piece of paper which he has filed purports to be an affidavit of John Volpe that he made certain determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.830" offset="894725">Now I know that no president which permits a party to filed in this Court, at this stage in the proceedings affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.688" offset="930147">I do recall that there was a case here, I believe in 1968 entitled Bumpers against North Carolina, in which the case, in which this Court, it granted certiorari to consider the validity of a warrantless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.120" offset="991901">And as I recall that case during the course of the oral argument, the attorney for the state said for the first time in the proceedings that in fact the search in that case had not been without a warrant, that he had found the warrant after the decision below and I believe he attempted to file the warrant in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.248" offset="1072358">As I recall the opinion in that case, the Court said, it's too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.714" offset="1086255">You make your record in a trial court and at that point you consider that's where these facts are tried out.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="257.863" offset="1134843">Generally, I am not familiar with any aspect that would bear on this point.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="264.492" offset="1161383">Well, it is a big aspect that bears very directly on this point.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_w_vardaman_jr" startTime="268.895" stopTime="342.900">
            <label>Mr. John W. Vardaman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="268.895" offset="1178937">Well, perhaps if the Court would like, memorandum on whether this evidence is properly before the Court at this time, I would be happy to file a memorandum, but I think that this is an extraordinary effort in which -- the manner in which to present evidence in a case, particularly since we were not permitted, in fact, the Court of Appeals held that we were barred by this Court's decision in Morgan from taking a deposition which we had specifically offered, will dispute one of these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.599" offset="1337762">If as we submit one of the crucial issues in this case, is whether the determinations under Section 49 (f) of the Department of Transportation Act have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.970" offset="1383215">We think that it's undisputed that that is a crucial issue in this case then that issue should be tired out in the way disputed issues in fact are traditionally tried in lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.844" offset="1426787">We should put on our evidence and they should put theirs on.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.129" offset="1439848">Each side's evidence should be subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.688" offset="1454164">We should not try it up by affidavits filed in this Court.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="342.900" offset="1474957">These paper will be lodged and the Court will determine their posture at a latter date and if we need anything from you Mr. Vardaman will then indicate to you that -- we'll invite you come and offer it.</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Vardaman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="355.473" offset="1525217">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.724" offset="1534307">With respect to -- I might add that in my review of these documents at the time before they were filed indicates to me that they do not fulfill the requirements of the department, the transportation order which was as I understand promulgated on October 7, 1970, which now requires formal findings, in cases under Section 4 (f) of the Department of Transportation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.122" offset="1643813">So even if the Court were consider, to consider this evidence the Secretary has still not complied with that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.663" offset="1677981">And I think under this courts decision in the Thorpe case, where it states the general rule that the issues presented here must be determined in accordance with the law as it existed at the time of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.103" offset="1731793">Even if you consider these pieces of paper it would still not be compliance with that order, or with the law and a remand would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.900" offset="1779022">The second issue which remains in this case, aside from the question of whether there was adequate compliance with Section 4 (f) by the Secretary's failure to render any written document at the time the decision was made, the second issue which remains is whether, whether the court below was proper in holding that petitioners were barred from deposing formal Federal Highway Administrator, Bridwell in order to determine whether or not the decisions under this Statute were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.047" offset="1915591">And we sought to depose formal Federal Highway Administrator, Bridwell because the documents in this case indicate that if he wasn't the sole person who made the determinations at least he was intimately involved in any determination that would have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.035" offset="1979538">Indeed the record never refers, at least, until these documents submitted today there was no reference in the record to decision made by former secretary Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.085" offset="2027708">Wherever his name appeared, it appeared jointly with Federal Highway Administrator Bridwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.219" offset="2048293">More over it was Mr. Bridwell who went to Congress to testify about what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.696" offset="2070131">So we noticed the deposition of Mr. Bridwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.164" offset="2080057">We have offered to prove through his deposition that no such determination was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.154" offset="2100015">That in fact, he merely delegated this to City Council of Memphis and left it up to them to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.932" offset="2127078">The Court of Appeals said that this Court's decision in Morgan against United States prohibited any interrogation of the Secretary as to determine whether or not he made these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.955" offset="2183189">We believe that that is erroneous extension of the Morgan Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.585" offset="2197713">While Morgan may prohibit inquiry as to how decisions were made it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.263" offset="2220387">I believe this Court's decisions in Accardi case show that it does not prohibit inquiry as to whether a decision which is required by law to be made was in fact made and I think the point is even sharpened more by the fact that now we have an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.388" offset="2288933">An affidavit from a man who has not been cross examined, an affidavit which we have not been permitted to impeach which purports through what is a disputed fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.086" offset="2347760">If this time the statement, these two statements and part of the original record, would you think that you could cross examine the former Secretary and the present Secretary on how they reached the conclusions and what their --</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Vardaman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="582.811" offset="2434591">Well, I think that would present a much more difficult issue Your Honor, but I think we should be able to interrogate them particularly if they are not operating on the basis of a contemporaneous document.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.257" offset="2492374">In other words, these are not documents that were written at the time the decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.116" offset="2507839">These are, what I characterize as litigation affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.120" offset="2519855">These are obviously prepared with the help of a lawyer, with the scope of lawsuit firmly in mind and filed in the court and I think it would not be an appropriate in circumstances of that nature to ask him, whether in fact he made the decisions and if so what materials he had before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.394" offset="2588923">I don't think it would be proper, and may not be proper to say, did you read every page as they tried to do in Morgan or did you consider this factor on page one and that factor on page two.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.238" offset="2628315">But I think it is fair, I think those attacking decisions must be able to ascertain what decisions were made and what the basis that is, what the documents before the person would have been in order that they can seek a review , in other words they can seek a review of what he did on the basis of what he purportedly acted upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.085" offset="2791737">There are cases, and I believe in Accardi case there was a finding or in the Singer Sewing Machine Case there were some findings where these quasi judicial body's members I don't remember, people associated with them were interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.274" offset="2852446">But certainly there would be no reason if we had formal findings in this case, it would take a very strong showing in order to interrogate him and I'm not prepared to say, it would even being necessary, if we had the proper findings in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.374" offset="6544906">No, the park is this area Mr. Justice from there to there, and that is all that we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.641" offset="6581896">What I am trying to point out is that the land up to the park on both sides was cleared after April 1968, and substantially all cleared by January 1969 when Secretary Volpe took office, and all cleared by November 1969, when he approved the design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.526" offset="6673429">Now here it is, one of the alternate which was considered, here is another alternate that was considered, this triangular line is an alternate which is suggested in one of the affidavits that's filed by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.320" offset="6760678">This is a pedestrian bridge for access to the zoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.035" offset="6779486">This also is a pedestrian bridge with access to the zoo, and this is a cross street, which is left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.792" offset="6822536">The state has bought the 26 acres through the park, for $2,200,000, and the city has already expended $1,000,000 for 160 acre park with a golf course, and it spent $200,000 on improvements to the zoo, and is obligated to expend the remaining million dollars for additional parkland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.485" offset="6937266">And thus the park resources of Memphis will be increased by some 320 acres on account of the loss of 26 acres in Overton Park.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.583" offset="7237674">In the brief time available to me for oral argument, I cannot deal with all of the arguments here, but I will confine my consideration to four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.043" offset="7283545">There are special circumstances here, which makes this a suitable place to put this role and which support the determination of the Secretary that there is no other 'feasible and prudent' and I emphasis the fact that the statute says 'and prudent' alternative to this route. Overton Park has always been divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.358" offset="7376854">There is in fact the park and the zoo, and for 75 years or so they have been separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.226" offset="7412276">This is the zoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.570" offset="7421680">The zoo has been extended into this area and this although it appears to be trees, is trees has parking space under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.439" offset="7453132">The park is south of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.099" offset="7467760">At first there was a narrow gauge railway across the land at this point, then trolley tracks, and for the past 30 years or so the trolley tracks have been replaced by a paved bus route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.559" offset="7517602">This right-of-way is 40 or 50 feet wide and it has city bus traffic with no protection, and that is been there for 60 or 70 years in one form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.652" offset="7574026">There is however and always has been limited access to the zoo, and that's what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.379" offset="7600880">Along the bus route at the South side of the zoo there is a chain link fence 6 or 7 feet high, except at the East end where the parking lot for the zoo is located and will continue to be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.248" offset="7656364">The bus route already occupies 4 or 5 acres which of course has no trees on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.769" offset="7682487">So we are talking about 21 or 22 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.491" offset="7697324">The park now contains 150 acres of unimproved woodland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.425" offset="7717073">It can be seen here at the lake so that the statement made in one of the letters in the record and relied on in the petitioners' brief that there won't be much in the way of wooded park left in Overton Park after an interstate highway is routed through it is obviously a greatly over exaggerated statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.864" offset="7802859">There will be at least 130 acres of wooded parkland left in Overton Park.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.334" offset="8192711">The legislative history shows that it was intended that the Secretary should make this judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.430" offset="8245060">That there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of this land and that all possible planing to minimize harm to the park has been done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.882" offset="8310888">The statute doesn't require findings or a trial-type hearing by the Secretary, and it would be a mistake for this Court to conclude we respectfully submit that findings by the Secretary are required or that he should be required to conduct a trail-type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.489" offset="8397302">Following a suggestion which was made in the previous oral argument in this case, we have obtained from both Secretaries involved certificates, stating their findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.016" offset="8443486">Now these are referred to by Mr. Vardaman, understandably as affidavits, but they are not so denominated themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.145" offset="8479953">They are certificates made by a high government officer with respect to actions which they took and they do we submit serve to clarify any ambiguity which may lie in the record by reason of the fact that they did not make formal findings, which I again submit the statute does not require them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.214" offset="8568247">We recognize that the presentation of these documents is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.670" offset="8590085">We submit them for what effect they can properly be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.170" offset="8608057">I repeat the suggestion came from the previous oral argument in the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.819" offset="10818644">If this test of review is whether the Secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner which we think is the test, we think it is a apparent from this record that neither Secretary acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, ignoring their requirements of the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.122" offset="10887816">If that does not adequately appear, then we think the case should be remanded so that the administrative record can be seen by the District Court and that question determined on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.761" offset="10938389">What we think should not be done here, is anything which requires a trail type hearing before the Secretary or anything which leads to, what amounts to a trial de novo before a district court and a decision of this question in effect by the District Court rather than by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.870" offset="11014875">Because that is my final point, a fundamental question here, one of the separation powers, of the proper allocation of the function that courts, legislatures and the executive branch in the important and complex task of carrying on government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.903" offset="11083003">Two things are clear, one is that Congress is legislated certain specific requirements with respect to the use of park lands and the other is that it is allocated the administration of that provision to the executive branch specifically to the Secretary of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.436" offset="11157086">This doesn't mean that there is no role for the courts where the Secretary should be held and check if he ignores the legislative requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.448" offset="11193135">But it does mean that the proper role of the courts is now unlimited one and it is important I submit, both through the administration of the government and for the courts, that the limited nature of that role be recognized and observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.906" offset="11258964">It is not good government to have all governmental decisions decided by courts or even that have a situation where as a matter of routine, all questions arising in the administration of the government are habitually referred to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.211" offset="11324165">In recent years, more and more governmental decisions are being made by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.691" offset="11346108">The recent broadening or near elimination of concepts of standing and the limitations on sovereign immunity as a defense have contributed to this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.477" offset="11397308">Of course, court should see that the constitution is complied with and that the statutory rules are followed, but is it wise that the substance of all administrative actions should be subject to reevaluation in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.904" offset="11463032">What the two secretaries have done here, they have acted, what they have done is rational, and it complies that is directives given to them by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.547" offset="11609527">I will not at this time attempt to restate the facts or using time for that purpose, since I think that the Solicitor General has stated them quite well to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.269" offset="11660413">I've being the only attorney at the bar today who has played in this park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.943" offset="11679117">I do feel that I probably know more the details than either of my colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.848" offset="11710777">I would be of course happy to answer questions in that vein but I will pass from the facts to take up what I feel are the issues that affects this case, and affect my client, the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.478" offset="11773262">I think the best place to start any argument is at the beginning and I think it would be helpful to the Court, if I went back to the beginning of this case, as it will help you to understand all five issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.504" offset="11857377">And the beginning of this case is the beginning of any case is the pleadings and the complaint filed by the petitioners in this case sets up the case, it sets up the standard of judicial review and it sets up what type of judicial review should be had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.032" offset="11943476">In the petitioners' original complaint, they charge that the Secretary didn't make findings, that is really the only basic issue in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.319" offset="12000632">Actually, although, I was glad to see this morning the affidavits are filed by the Solicitor General and of course, the other affidavits in the record as to approval of the route and reaffirmation actually on the motion for summary judgment that was before the District Court and the Court of Appeals and is before this Court, None of those affidavits were actually necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.839" offset="12090702">The complaint filed by Mr. Vardaman states all of the necessary facts for this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.087" offset="12119751">He states that Secretary Boyd approved the route and of course, the word approved is the keyword in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.461" offset="12153187">There is no dispute concerning the approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.252" offset="12164368">There is no dispute concerning the final approval of the route design in November 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.205" offset="12196237">Since the complaint filed by the petitioner states all of those facts, and therefore they admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.605" offset="12225808">He raises the issue as to whether or not findings as such were required under the parkland statute and in the record, in the appendix, you'll see as cited in our brief, the colloquy that it occurred between Mr. Vardaman and District Judge Brown on this very point, as to what the issues were and what he was contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.216" offset="12320266">I think it's quite clear that the issue was whether or not specific findings are necessary under the Act and that is, of course, I think the main problem that this Court has to face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.720" offset="12374288">If this Court believes as I do, and as the Solicitor General does that this is a discretionary statute that Congress gave the Secretary of Transportation, a discretion to make this decision and that findings as such or not require by the statute or by either the application or non-application of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.863" offset="12466866">I feel I have discuss quite fully in our brief that it does not apply to discretionary decision of this type, that the Court can reach its conclusion and end this case one way or the other on that point alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.638" offset="12629974">I tend to agree to a certain extent with the Solicitor General, although we do disagree on one or two other points in this case, regarding administrative record, that the Administrative Procedure Act does not apply, but it really doesn't make any difference whether it does or not, the result in the case is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.410" offset="12704998">Now the question of review, as I stated earlier the complaint filed about Mr. Vardaman does not charge Secretary Volpe with any misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.197" offset="12752123">It's always been my understanding of the law that when you challenge the actions of an administrator and you want to have a review on the question of whether he was arbitrary or capricious, you must allege some fact to bring it before the Court to have a trial on the merits which is what Mr. Vardaman ultimately wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.618" offset="12833834">They didn't say, as a matter of fact, they didn't even make a conclusory allegation that Secretary Volpe was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.829" offset="12866644">They just said he didn't make any findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.962" offset="12875212">Now this Court holds the findings he must make, that's the end of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.373" offset="12896841">If the Court holds that findings he need not make, that again is a dispositive to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.696" offset="12922128">Now it's not that he is precluded from judicial review or this Court is precluded from reviewing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.238" offset="12952325">It's because he did not allege facts that warrant judicial review beyond what he has here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.050" offset="12983568">If he had said that Secretary Volpe laid this route out because he had a relative nearby who'd profit from the sale of his land or the enhancement of its value or that he deliberately refused to consider evidence or that he deliberately chose engineers to advise him and whom he knew were not properly trained, that maybe the basis for a review beyond the sculpt that we have here on the question of summary judgment, but he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.016" offset="13115434">He just simply said, he made no findings although he admittedly admits that he approved the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.503" offset="13145422">Now going from that, there are many cases that have been before this Court and the lower Federal Courts to the effect that with those allegations, you can go farther and you can question the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.133" offset="13207907">I would think that if he had charged Secretary Volpe with some improper conduct, he would have a prefect right to examine him on that point.</text>
