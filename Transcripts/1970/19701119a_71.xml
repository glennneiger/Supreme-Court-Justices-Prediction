            <text syncTime="16.001" offset="167372">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.811" offset="190568">Rockland County is located in the New York City Metropolitan area approximately 30 miles from New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.749" offset="230379">Until a decade ago, it was a very small suburban community that is until the development of the New York State through it where upon it experienced rapid if not phenomenal growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.489" offset="289311">It consists of five towns and has been traditionally governed by five men board of supervisors, each supervisor being elected by one of the towns comprising the copy without regard to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.584" offset="357752">In 1964, this Court rendered a historic decision in the case of Reynolds against Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.871" offset="386905">And in 1965, a resident of Rockland County commenced an action in the New York State Supreme Court to compel the Rockland County Board of Supervisors to reapportion themselves in a manner more consistent with that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.484" offset="457331">The New York State Supreme Court referred that matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.832" offset="486693">And as a result, in 1966, the board of supervisors of the County of Rockland were directed to reapportion the County of Rockland in accordance with the mandates of this Court and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.578" offset="557641">The District Court further directed that a plan of reapportionment be placed upon the ballot for the general election of November 1966 for referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.834" offset="602676">This plan was rejected as were two subsequent plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.862" offset="626813">In 1968, a taxpayer’s action was commenced by Samuel J. Abate, one of the petitioners herein, to have the County of Rockland reapportion itself in accordance with the constitutional mandates of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.642" offset="689925">After several motions and hearings, the respondents herein were directed to serve an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.191" offset="720123">The respondent simultaneously moved in the New York State Supreme Court for summary judgment requesting that the court direct implementation of a local law providing for weighted voting without referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.034" offset="775502">The plan for weighted voting was rejected by the court and the respondents herein were directed to present to the court a proposed plan of reapportionment with all deliberate speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.754" offset="830360">The board of supervisors had previous this point appointed a sub-committee of the charter commission and the charter commission -- the sub-committee of the charter commission recommended to the board a single-member district plan which was rejected by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.101" offset="895770">The board subsequently had recommended to it a multi-member district plan by the sub-committee of the charter commission and that multi-member district plan was presented to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.349" offset="952717">The petitioners herein objected to the proposed multi-member district on several grounds and further sought to submit for the court’s approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.173" offset="988035">A single-member district plan which was considered to be more in keeping with the decisions of this Honorable Court, such presentation was not committed by the New York State Supreme Court and the court approved the multi-member district plan submitted by the board of supervisors to respondents herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.779" offset="1066506">Appeals were taken to the Appellate Division in the Second Department in the State of New York and the decision of the lower court was affirmed with the dissent by the late Justice Beldock.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.633" offset="1109870">A subsequent appeal was taken to the New York States Court of Appeals where again the lower courts decision was affirmed with the dissent by Chief Judge Fuld.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.530" offset="1153442">Subsequently, permission for certiorari was granted by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.524" offset="1177475">There are there petitioners in this proceeding and by special permission of this Court, all three have been granted permission to appear today and orally argue this course.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.852" offset="1218748">I should like to tell the Court that there will be no repetition of argument by counsel in order to save the time of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.855" offset="1246751">We sincerely believe that this is the only fashion in which this matter could be properly laid before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.307" offset="1272560">I have been chosen to make the opening statement and so I give you some of the history of this matter and will also outline for you some of the arguments that counsel will make.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.213" offset="1312266">Counsel will argue that the multi-member district plan does not meet the requirements of equal representation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States as such requirements have been mandated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.245" offset="1368377">Counsel will show that the respondents have failed to make the good-faith effort which is required that a multi-member district plan is unconstitutional if its district lines are static but its population is subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.533" offset="1433475">That a single-member district plan does not meet the requirements of the one man, one vote doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.891" offset="1462941">And that the standards of equal representation as mandated by this Court apply equally to all levels of government, and that multi-member districts in the County of Rockland cannot possibly meet the standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.378" offset="1576835">Yes, Mr. Justice. Our opposition is that every decision of this Court has been consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.936" offset="1611107">Every decision of this Court in spite of the Reynolds decision which indicated that certain de minimis situations were unavoidable on certain situations that regardless of that, the requirement is that there must be an absolute de minimis and if one plan can achieve, if you will, a more minimal population variation, that is the plan which must be accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.434" offset="8261151">The original board of supervisors felt that it was important to maintain a voice on the county level of government from the towns and that’s what brought about this type of multi-member district plan and that’s really the only thing that’s involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.152" offset="8323950">Also, it was felt that there were certain towns like the smallest town, Town of Stony Point that was somewhat isolated from the other towns which are large and they wanted to have a voice of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.562" offset="8369612">They didn’t want to be amalgamated with a not a larger area and perhaps ease that type of identity which that community had had over the many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.520" offset="8405452">So what we’re talking about really is numbers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.096" offset="8419767">It is our position that the plan which was devise complies with the rule which was set down in Reynolds versus Sims and apply to local governments in Avery versus Midland County which requires that the population be substantially equal or in other terms as was used that as nearly as practical -- practicable the district’s view of equal population and we feel that we have actually met that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.914" offset="8538990">Now, I am set forth in appendix A-2 of my brief a complete breakdown of how these figures operate and at the present time, based upon the 1969 census, the population variation which is the largest is in the town of Orangetown where the deviation is 7.1% underrepresented and then the town of Clarkstown that’s 4.8% overrepresented making a spread of 11.9% from the smallest to the largest.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Martin Cornell</label>
            <text syncTime="2148.691" offset="8698128">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.662" offset="8701994">As of 1970 and these figures are not before the court because these figures are very recent, the 1970 census has reduced these population disparity so that the town of Orangetown which did have a 7.1% under representation, now is underrepresented by 4.7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.869" offset="8810872">The town of Clarkstown which had a 4.8% variation now has a 3.2% variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.971" offset="8851205">The town of Ramapo has a 0% deviation that hits it right on the nose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.343" offset="8884746">Haverstraw has a 0.8% variation at the present time and that the Town of Stony Point, it changes from 0.3% to 1.1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.981" offset="8939290">Now, the spread between the largest and the smallest now is 7.9% so that the deviation between these two smallest and largest of 7.1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.117" offset="8999790">Now in terms of absolute population, this amounts to 1,017 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.296" offset="9032600">If you take the town -- Orangetown which has a deviation of 4.7% to bring that into line, you would have to shift the lines around some 400 or 500 people which we feel is unrealistic because in fact it means that you may have to cut a district line down somebody’s backyard of even to an apartment building to pick up that number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.817" offset="9134686">And I think that one of the factors that’s extremely important here is to recognize that when you talk about percentage deviations, you must consider the size of the district which is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.902" offset="9191006">Now for example in Wells versus Rockefeller involving the State of New York which was approved by this Court in May, the new districting plan on the congressional level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.554" offset="9237608">The average population for the congressional district in New York which is approved was 490,324.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.537" offset="9277524">Now 1% deviation in the congressional district would amount to an absolute population of 4,000, a little over 4,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.934" offset="9323081">Now, it’s one thing to shift to district lines around to pick up or exclude 4,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.049" offset="9347532">But a 1% deviation in Rockland County amounts to 1% of the main population of 12,000 or approximately a 121 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.489" offset="9389328">And it is impractical and unrealistic to consider a necessity of shifting or moving lines or adjusting legislators to pick up or exclude a 121 people to provide for 1% deviation of more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.083" offset="9447737">Therefore, it is our position that you must look at the size of the district in relation to an analysis of percentage deviations so that it can be a practical application of rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.915" offset="9511058">I would also like to point out that the question which was raised in the Hadley case involving the trustees in the community college which was not approve by this Court was a different type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.611" offset="9573857">There you had a built-in bias in favor of the smaller districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.602" offset="9597785">There were six trustees that were elected and the larger district would only get three trustees if they were from 50% to 60% of the school enumeration in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.086" offset="9659747">And this Court said in that case that you are not reaching the question as to whether or not there is equal apportionment of trustees among a limited number of component districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.923" offset="9719097">And you stated that he have said before that mathematical exactitude is not required but a plan that does not automatically discriminate in favor or certain districts is and in that case, that’s exactly what there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.127" offset="9775835">There was a built-in bias and an automatic discrimination against the larger districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.628" offset="9797883">There’s a built-in bias in favor of the smaller districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.714" offset="9810213">That problem is not found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.977" offset="9823274">In this case, we merely have a situation where there were equal member districts -- multi-member districts and there is no built-in bias that’s in favor of the smaller or the larger districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.075" offset="9879698">There was reliance by the petitioner here upon Kirkpatrick versus Preisler and Wells versus Rockefeller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.050" offset="9911568">These were both congressional cases and in the Wells versus Rockefeller case, there was a rejection of a maximum population spread between the highest and the lowest of approximately 13%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.336" offset="9980740">In the Kirkpatrick case involving the congressional districts in Missouri, there was a rejection of a spread of approximately 6% between the highest and lowest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.112" offset="10027865">Now, it is our position that you cannot on a wholesale basis take these percentage deviations that may not be acceptable on a congressional level and transpose them down onto smaller districts where there is smaller populations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.011" offset="10095365">Also, I think the facts in both of those cases are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.085" offset="10115741">In Wells versus Rockefeller, we had a situation where the State of New York admitted that there was an attempt to provide equal population for sub-districts and that the congressional districts were then carved out of these regional districts within the State and the record shows that the State admits that there was not an effort really to fine home the district lines on the congressional level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.878" offset="10226918">In the Missouri case, there are also indications that, number one there was not a proper census data that was made for determining the district lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.136" offset="10279894">And also there is a clear admission in that case, that merely by shifting several counties around that they could have provided for a more equal population in those congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.110" offset="10323780">We don’t have that situation in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.462" offset="10337259">The town lines have been used as the district lines and the legislators have been allocated to the towns in accordance with the population and as I say the population deviation is extremely minimal and there is no way that you could arrive at a lesser population deviation if you would hear the town lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.330" offset="10436733">This is the only way that it can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.683" offset="10454079">Now, Chief Judge Fuld in the Court of Appeals dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.882" offset="10482918">And he asked me when I argued that case off the bench whether I wasn’t concerned about the future population changes and whether or not this plan might depending upon how the figures came out subsequently result in a more substantial deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.698" offset="10558151">Before I had a chance to answer the question, Judge Breitel said yes but the figures might get better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.956" offset="10583228">And that’s exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.650" offset="10590020">So I think that the argument that he relies upon his dissent has been undercut by what actually has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.701" offset="10626173">Any plan whether it’s a single-member district plan or a multi-member district plan as soon as the population changes whether it be the next year or thereafter, there may have to be some adjustment to account for the changes in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.685" offset="10686151">As a matter of fact, in this case, the population figures that resulted in 1970 improved the situations, so the population deviation now is as low as I mentioned before 7.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.033" offset="10743515">So I think the reasoning that Judge Fuld set forth in his dissenting opinion cannot be upheld based upon actually what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.801" offset="11926549">In the State of New York, county governments in the past have been run by the supervisors who are the chief executive officers in the towns within the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.073" offset="12007633">The town selected a chief executive officer who served on the county border supervisors and actually an ex-officio capacity and would run the county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.219" offset="12052250">Therefore, the towns had a direct voice in the operation of county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.178" offset="12076074">And on the county level, there are a number of functions of county government which can also be performed on the town level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.343" offset="12116720">And the desirability of having an interrelationship between a town and county government, in the opinion of the board of supervisors was to provide for the conduct of business on this countywide basis so that there would be an interrelationship between the operation of both county and town government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.522" offset="12197491">For example, there is a large county sewer district in the County of Rockland which has a sewer plant and sewer lines which ties indirectly with lateral lines in the towns so that this function of providing sewer service is directly interrelated between town and county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.068" offset="12283695">The county has a Civil Service Department which administers the civil service on the town level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.513" offset="13477386">I think on a congressional level that municipal boundary lines are far less significant that they are for example in New York where historically and traditionally, there has been this interrelationship between town and county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.207" offset="13532244">Now, as a matter of fact, to demonstrate the interrelationship here, the plan of reapportionment when it was originally devised provided that the town chief executive officer who was elected within the town would be one of the legislators within that town automatically and that he would serve for example in the town of Ramapo which has six legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.831" offset="13642689">There would be the supervisor of the town, the chief executive officer plus the five others which would provide for very direct interrelationships so that the chief executive officer on the town would still continue on the county level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.647" offset="13701935">The Court in New York rejected that and said that the statutes did not permit that interrelationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.548" offset="13729520">Therefore, the chief executive officer in the towns must run separately for that county office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.226" offset="13760240">In other words, the chief executive officer in the town can run on the ballot in two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.251" offset="13784377">One, he runs as a legislator and secondly, he runs as a town supervisor and as a practical matter, in Rockland County today, out of the five towns four of them have their chief executive officer who serves on the town level and is also elected and serves on the county level as well and one of the towns this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.838" offset="13878732">So that this plan has effectively provided for this interrelationship between town and county government which is what is attempted to do being also in compliance with the requirements of Reynolds versus Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.359" offset="13940799">You see what happens on the local level is that when you apply the rule of one man, one vote to a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.777" offset="13974444">It can have the effect if you set up single-member districts of slicing a part the interrelationship between town and county government so that you would separate the operation of county government and town government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.139" offset="14027943">And it was our attempt to comply with the rule but at the same time to apply for this interrelationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.974" offset="14059290">And that’s exactly what was done here in Rockland County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.578" offset="14093667">The concept of tight mathematical equality is our position is somewhat unrealistic when you’re dealing with populations which are shifting constantly from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.311" offset="14160645">It’s true even in the situation of Rockland County where the census itself is not a scientific ascertainment of the number of people involved and also where in fact there is a constant growth and a constant shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.046" offset="14227519">So that to provide for a very tight absolute mathematical equality at any one point in time, seem somewhat illusory because within a few months or a year thereafter it may have shifted or changed so that in fact is not achieving the ultimate goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.767" offset="14306408">The flexibility which is required on the local level here in Rockland County is desirable and it is our position that if a tight mathematical formulation is applied on the local level that it may create difficulties in other areas where there is attempts perhaps you create regional governments or amalgamation of governments on a regional basis between some of the cities in the suburbs and that there you may have a necessity for compact or an understanding between these governments to arrive at a regional type of approach of the government and if you apply the population, the equal population principle with strict exactitude on the local level this may have the effect of foreclosing the ability to create any type of regional governmental units which I suggest may be some of the solution to the problems which we’ve had in the cities in the next decades ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.556" offset="14633566">This Court has of course upheld multi-member districts on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.117" offset="14659793">Fortson versus Dorsey involving Georgia was one of the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.149" offset="14679960">Burns versus Richardson involving the State of Hawaii and then there have been a number of affirmances of lower courts involving Wyoming, Arkansas, and of course recently the State of New Jersey and Jackman versus Bodine which I think you’re familiar with provided for multi-member districts as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.593" offset="14761775">It is our position that the use of multi-member districts is a constitutional method of complying with the one man, one vote requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4577.790" offset="18414529">And finally, that if the ultimate test is fair and effective representation, is set forth in Reynolds versus Sims, that one should not look at the equal population principle and that presented deviations which are found has the ends but merely a means to actually arriving at the ultimate goal of fair and effective representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.520" offset="18517452">And its thorough absolute-type mathematical analysis of population deviations may in fact frustrate the situation and that the use of town boundary lines in this case, of course also avoids the rather practical problems of gerrymandering.</text>

            <text syncTime="4994.704" offset="20082186">That are growth is burgeoning so greatly but Your Honor, there are some realistic limitations on it in the north end of the county which is the base of this plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="5027.485" offset="20213321">And it is very possible that as part of the result, we may end up with exactly the situation the Chief Judge Fuld in the Court of Appeals said namely, a 90% or an 80% discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5069.799" offset="20382595">And I think this plan has within it the invidious invitation to continuing litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.537" offset="20413524">And I mean that not only in Rockland by I think it will be emulated throughout the State of New York and throughout the country for the very simple reason that it ahs the beauty from the standpoint of those who are in local government now and who have dominated the structure, the desirability of maintaining their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.564" offset="20501608">Counsel has talked about the rational state policy and the importance of the town and the town supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.323" offset="20528671">He didn’t mention the fact that even the state law did not write into it the automatic right of the supervisor to seat on this body and yet this county legislature, this county board of supervisors in endeavoring to preserve itself, not to secure equality of representation gentlemen but to preserve itself, put into its local law and when you look in the appendix you’ll see it, the right to seat not because they are elected as a legislator but because they are elected as a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.047" offset="20647581">Well, this was struck down even in New York; the lower courts struck this down right from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.971" offset="20667225">But what I’m saying is that you must look at it in terms of what kind of an effort was being made here, not what was corrected by the courts because we’re talking about good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.937" offset="20711111">We’re talking about good faith and we’re talking about good faith to a voter and a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.421" offset="20733053">Nobody is a going to reduce my taxes by the extent that my vote is diminished in the county of Rockland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.019" offset="20771401">And yet my voice and my vote this year was reduced 12% or 11.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.729" offset="20798255">Next year 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.984" offset="20803271">Next year perhaps 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.548" offset="20817586">And all that I am saying is that my vote should always have the same relationship within the ability of men to achieve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.149" offset="20855933">And I do not believe that that effort has been made here and it is not a question of multi-member districts or the (Inaudible) ideas of a professor who has written a very fascinating article on the square root of something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.821" offset="20910686">I’m not a mathematician.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.935" offset="20915075">I’m a lawyer and I’m a voter and I’m interested in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.731" offset="20930330">Judge Stewart, you asked the question this morning at the beginning of our argument relating to the political structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.492" offset="20953318">May I comment on it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul H. Rivet</label>
            <text syncTime="5216.343" offset="20968782">The petitioners here represent the entire spectrum of the political body.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.923" offset="20995114">Responsible leaders of the Republican Party, responsible leaders in the Democratic Party, public officials, elected, one of my clients is a councilman in the town of Orangetown, and the petitioners June Molof and others are essentially the League of Women Voters of Rockland County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.621" offset="21061883">What I am saying is that we are not a group of either do-gooders or people out to hone an ax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.260" offset="21088423">We are all seeking an effort to be able to express ourselves fairly with equality before the body politic and we have been frustrated in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.413" offset="21133040">Mr. Justice Marshall commented on, isn’t it better to have a one to one relationship because you know who to look to when you have a problem and you know who to look to when something is not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.601" offset="21173791">Well, what is happening now and we’re having a circus in Rockland County is that we have four and five men representing 40-50,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.517" offset="21209422">And it’s a dreadful situation nobody knows who’s responsible for what.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.540" offset="21225514">And going a step further, I realize that a thousand people may sound like very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.977" offset="21247248">Rockland County, despite my adversaries, my good friend’s brief where he points out that well, you can’t divide an apartment house.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.114" offset="21279848">Rockland County is not a county of apartment houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.375" offset="21288835">This is a county of residences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.715" offset="21298239">And when we talk about a thousand people, we’re talking about 250 families, 250 homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.328" offset="21324675">That is a very large development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.997" offset="21339408">And moving a line involving a hundred homes is not a difficult line, it maybe involved moving two or three streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.689" offset="21378173">We’re not talking about running a line down the (Inaudible) of an apartment house.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.043" offset="21395519">There isn’t an apartment house in Rockland County that has a thousand people in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.546" offset="21409520">I doubt if there’s one in Rockland County to have more than 250 people in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.973" offset="21435225">The issue is not arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.316" offset="21452675">I cannot emphasize that too strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.466" offset="21465213">Obviously, we can’t win an argument on arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.986" offset="21475349">I mean because you can play games with these figures from now until tomorrow afternoon at this time, and we would never come to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.115" offset="21507845">And I do not think that the Court wants to set a rule where you say, well, you can’t have more than 1% or you can’t have more than 3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.020" offset="21535431">You must look at the entire picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.148" offset="21543999">In the State of Hawaii, you recognize rigid boundary lines and I think I understand why.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.835" offset="21570748">Very simply, in the State of Hawaii, you have islands divided by open ocean, in some cases, 50, 60 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.464" offset="21609200">Obviously, you couldn’t divide a man of course that greater distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.955" offset="21631143">I see my light is on gentlemen.</text>
