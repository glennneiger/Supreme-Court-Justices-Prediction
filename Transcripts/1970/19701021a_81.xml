            <text syncTime="16.049" offset="167581">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.628" offset="181896">The Williams case we have, involves two questions which are presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.408" offset="204988">One involves again the question of Chimel and retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.452" offset="233200">The and I believe the US Government has agreed that there’s no question about it, that this search did in fact violate the dictate in Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.243" offset="280325">But because of the second question presented namely of the -- which we presented all the way along, namely the fact that this search was a merely pretext and violate even pre-Chimel law, we will have to go into the facts itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.052" offset="331630">Again, it should be noted that this is a direct appeal from a conviction in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.720" offset="358275">The facts are such that on March 9, 1967, the defendant was alleged to have sold heroine to a Federal Narcotics agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.028" offset="403519">A warrant was issued approximately three weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.717" offset="414281">During this period of time, there was constant surveillance made of the residence in question and nothing was observed of an extraordinary nature except the fact that it appeared that two people were living there, the defendant and a woman, who later, again, turned out to be a common law wife, were obviously living in the residence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.126" offset="499858">Later on, evidence indicated that utility bills and so forth were in name of the woman, there was nothing found in the name of the man himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.484" offset="533295">A -- after the warrant was obtained, a meeting was held and which involves approximately at least nine police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.101" offset="567777">There is testimony in the motion to suppressed that there was specific discussions occurred about the manner in which they will be going to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.595" offset="609782">In other words, the police had full intentions of arresting the defendant in his home and there upon searching the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.946" offset="639143">Now, this particular evidence is contradicted by the testimony of three other police officers who denied this happened, but we still have the discrepancy between the testimony of the two police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.594" offset="761710">The nine police officers proceeded to the home of the defendant where they knocked on the door and he was observed in the living of the house in his underclothing eating some dinner.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.600" offset="1125752">Six, seven rooms, including a bathroom up.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.053" offset="1139545">As near as we can determine there were nine police officers involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.891" offset="1166921">The -- at the motion to suppress which was argued on January 12th in the US District Court in Phoenix, Arizona, we specifically objected to the admissibility of the evidence on the grounds that it was a search which went far beyond the dictates of Harris and Rabinowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.557" offset="1241631">We also argued that the search was a mere pretext and in fact that our whole motion is suppressed was based upon this premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.789" offset="1274546">Again, when we appealed the conviction to the Ninth Circuit, we again specifically eluded to the fact of the pretext and the fact that it was our feeling that search violated the Rabinowitz and Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.107" offset="1335777">When the Chimel case came out, the Ninth Circuit specifically requested before the memoranda with reference to the retroactivity of Chimel and after making that finding, they specifically found that the search involved did violate Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.961" offset="1415189">However, they said that it was not retroactive and therefore they affirmed the conviction of the defendant and we came up here on certiorari and hence we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.286" offset="1444551">The first issue I’d like to present to the Court on retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.178" offset="1468061">It would seem to be that we have a situation where if Mr. Williams -- if Mr. Chimel had not been so fortunate to arrive here before the Supreme Court of the United States before us, we might very well be here today arguing the same matters that were argued in front of us -- in front of the Court by Chimel and very well have a ruling consistent with Chimel that it was an illegal search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.001" offset="1579342">And in a effect by refusing to give retroactivity to this particular case on a direct appeal from a Federal Court, we are creating an equity in the law in that we are differentiating between merely because a man has not been as fast as someone else in coming here to Supreme Court of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.054" offset="1663561">It is felt that all the cases in which and this is Supreme Court has heard many times and which -- all the cases and which strictly a prospective application has been made, our cases of new law and new areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.064" offset="1723643">And again, it's we submit that in this particular case, and that Chimel is not a new area in that, it just in effect advised law enforcement authorities of what is reasonable, what is a reasonable search incidental to an arrest?</text>
            <text syncTime="424.639" offset="1801906">Harris came out and then the Court later on in Trepino specifically overruled Harris and again specifically held that the search incidental to an arrest should be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.066" offset="1847672">Rabinowitz, in the language of Rabinowitz which is specifically holds that Rabinowitz is to be considered on its facts that the reasonableness of a search is to be considered by all of facts and circumstances arriving at that particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.430" offset="1913083">And I would submit to the Court that the facts and situation in this particular case were such that the fact situation that they did not violate so to speak the dictates of Rabinowitz in this particular search.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.416" offset="1973060">In Rabinowitz, there was a one room office, there was arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.535" offset="1993540">The search is for an hour-and-a-half and there was a public place with exclusive possession in the part of Rabinowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.696" offset="2018200">In our particular case, we had a private home, the Government was not able to establish who owned the home, who actually had possession of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.927" offset="2063130">The search lasted for over two hours with an arrest warrant and approximately seven homes were searched, seven -- I would say that this particular case in facts situation is closer to the Von Cleef in which the Supreme Court specifically held that it was a illegal search pursuant the Harris, Rabinowitz rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.421" offset="2149021">And for that reason, they – if the Court should deem that retroactivity should not be applied in this particular case that it would reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit based upon the fact that it was an illegal search even without the ruling of Chimel</text>
            <text syncTime="530.512" offset="2225403">.I believe that the -- again, the question of retroactivity, the closest case I can really come to, it is the Spinelli case in which I think there’s no doubt about it that no one argues as to retroactivity of Spinelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.919" offset="2287052">I think Spinelli again took the search warrant in the narcotics case and expressed what would be required, what is required to show probable cause to a magistrate?</text>
            <text syncTime="555.201" offset="2324146">I believe Chimel has merely stated what is necessary what is probable cause, what is the basis for a search incidental to an arrest, and the similarity between the two are quite close.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.558" offset="2377644">Neither one is -- sets up new law such as the tight Desist opinion which in effect says that Katz is -- will not be replied retroactive and it’s quite clear that before Katz electronics eavesdropping was allowed although the Court was starting to mitigate it in many aspects, but it’s still is allowed in this particular session just do without completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.798" offset="2474611">I think Mr. Miller has covered that in his appendix which we also cite in our brief quite excellently and I would submit to the Court that in view of the fact that this was a direct appeal, on view of the fact that we specifically argued Chimel two years before Chimel ever came out that in a fact if the what -- if the Court denied our request at this time then, in effect what the Court would have to say is if the Ninth Circuit or in effect if the lower court had granted our motion and the Government in someway and a motion is suppress which that they have a right to appeal could come up and say, object to it and argue that it was not a valid ruling by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.563" offset="2657573">I think this would be ludicrous and yet because the trial court so to speak goofed, did not follow the law the way it should have been because we arrived approximately a year after Chimel before this Court we are based with the different decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.042" offset="2727581">I don’t think and I don’t feel that this is equal protection in law which should be given -- being given to Mr. Williams.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.988" offset="7547277">Though, there’s nothing in the record to suggest that any connection between that house and the narcotics dealings though they were familiar with the fact that he lived there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.446" offset="7625122">We suggest, therefore, that the Court should stand by its conclusion that the rational cut off point in any search and seizure case at least for retroactivity purposes is the date of the police activity which the new rule determines to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.779" offset="7714461">I think upon analysis this turns out to be the most rational fairest cut off point that could be evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.644" offset="7769945">To be sure, it’s been suggested that turning down a man whose case was on direct review at the time the new rule was laid down, is in a sense unfair to him because one man who comes to this Court, one day he gets relief and a man who comes to the Court in the same posture the next day does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.014" offset="7855417">On the other hand, I don’t think it has been suggested that the man who came the day before for Chimel did for example, should be given relief simply because of the fact that he was in this Court at about the same time as Chimel, and of course he is penalized perhaps because his lawyer or if he had one didn’t draft his petition perhaps as artistically has Chimel did or for some reason or other the Court happen to take a wider case rather than an earlier one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.541" offset="7989582">Also, I think it has to be now recognized that how long a particular case remains pending on direct review is the product of a number of factors which don’t necessarily reflect upon fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.237" offset="8060322">A more affluent defendant or a defendant with a less responsible lawyer may have more or less a better or worse lawyer depending on the circumstances may have for one reason or another kept this case alive on direct review with arguments that have nothing to do perhaps with the new rule to which he becomes the beneficiary just because perhaps his case had been kept alive on the basis of arguments that might been criminally frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.498" offset="8193337">And of course, the states of -- the dockets of the various Courts and Courts of Appeals around the country, again, are -- these factors which have nothing to do with fairness of whether one defendant should be in jail or another one should be out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.115" offset="8251852">So that it seems to us that it did to the Court in Desist that the fairest most rational dividing point is the date of the activity upon which the new rule focuses and if the new rule focuses upon pre-trial investigatory activity as many of the new rules the Court has considered to the cut off date should be, the date of the activity and that was carried out in reliance on the old rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="2077.953" offset="8415169">Yes, that does Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.858" offset="8422797">Of course that I believe, I think that the -- and some justices at least if not the Court have suggested that any new rule could be made wholly perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.969" offset="8475251">There’s at least no constitutional barrier to doing that, though as the opinion in Stovall against Denno which considered this, suggested there maybe I think or a jurisprudential reasons for not doing that and that’s the problem of simple incentive of lawyers to bring cases raising new principles to the further consideration, that the Court has over the years considered that its decision are best made when they are required and made in terms of the facts of a particular record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.185" offset="8620074">I think it is a little harsh and rigid to say that because the Court has chosen not to make new law in that wholly perspective way that it must therefore give relief to everybody whose case was on direct review either in this Court or some other Court at the time of the new decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.300" offset="8720593">Because and as I’ve suggested that in terms of the practicalities and in terms of the hundreds or thousands defendants who are in prison around the country, that is not a very fair or I would submit rational dividing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.677" offset="8802095">I might just say a word about the point that both Mr. Florence and the petitioner in Elkanich raised as to what the Government says, the principle is upon which the Court should determine whether there is a retroactivity question or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.967" offset="8891225">I think it’s not a fair reading of our argument to say that we have concoctive the magical term landmark and that it’s only landmark cases which are not -- we argue would not be a retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.218" offset="8952247">I think that the question whether there is a retroactivity question which may in some cases be a hard one, though, I don’t think it is here has to be made in terms of the practical question whether there has been a substantial change in the rules by which in the Fourth Amendment context for example, police behavior has been molded and could reasonably be molded or in the case of matters occurring at trial whether there has been a substantial change in a rule that has been used for the guidance of trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.383" offset="9116923">I think in each case as all of these retroactivity considerations that must considered in terms of the practicalities of the situation.</text>
