            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="38.246" offset="257421">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.169" offset="273095">This is a first degree murder case here in forma pauperis and certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.935" offset="308099">Two constitutional questions are presented, the first is whether a search warrant issued by the Attorney General of the state upon the un-sworn reports, oral reports of his subordinates, while he is in active charge of a criminal investigation and when he will actually himself lead the prosecution, is a valid search warrant for the purposes of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and of course we submit that it plainly is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.934" offset="456161">The second question which relates to an entirely different incident so that we may win on either ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.775" offset="487508">The second question is whether a wife’s acquiescence in the taking of her husband’s personal belongings will validate what otherwise is an unconstitutional search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments as this being a state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.050" offset="568592">These two questions are better understood if I outline the salient points concerning the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.287" offset="601506">On January 13, 1964, a young girl Pamela Mason left her house in Manchester, New Hampshire on a baby sitting assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.509" offset="646437">She disappeared, eight days later, her body was found by the side of the Principal Interstate Highway leading south.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.809" offset="687606">The state’s theory later became that she had been shot by a 22-caliber Mossberg rifle, also, her throat had been cut with a knife and that the body had been dumped there about 9 o’clock or 9:30, perhaps that same evening when it was covered by an unusually heavy snow storm and then after a rainstorm eight days later became visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.392" offset="790006">This was a disappearance and crime which excited enormous attention in Manchester and indeed through the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.619" offset="838907">At the time, the police broadcast appeals for people to come forward with the names of anyone who were out of the house that evening and eventually one of petitioner’s neighbors reported to the police that he had been out of his house that night and they went to the house on January 28, police, two of them and questioned him about his whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.968" offset="944232">He gave an explanation which unfortunately for him later turned out to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.151" offset="968997">He also showed the police some guns that he had in the house at that time, spoke to them very freely and they asked him if he would be willing to go up to Concorde to the headquarters of the state police to take a lie detector test, he said that he would and since he was working as a bakery truck driver, asked that it be on his day off Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.192" offset="1057186">Then on Sunday, February 2, they did indeed go up to the state police headquarters and he took the lie detector test which produced no affirmative indication if his guilt, but at that time he did admit that he had embezzled a small sum of money from his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.514" offset="1154466">When they went back to Manchester, he was questioned late into the night by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.165" offset="1185081">He was not actually arrested in a formal sense till after midnight but the trial judge found that he would not be permitted to leave at any time after they had returned from Manchester -- from Concorde.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.365" offset="1253836">The first search and seizure of which we complain occurred on that day February 2, while petitioner was in custody at the Manchester police station, two different officers who had never been to his house before went to his house and with the acquiescence of his wife Mrs. Coolidge obtained his guns and clothing and took them away.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.040" offset="1556543">The second -- so I say petitioner was held at the police station, he was held overnight on this larceny charge and then he was released on his own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.118" offset="1600846">So that he was not imprisoned during the ensuing weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.890" offset="1623939">The second search and seizure occurred some weeks later on February 19, you see almost three weeks after the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.690" offset="1671168">Attorney General Menard who had taken active charge of the investigation in prosecution, called a conference in his office in Concorde for the purpose of reviewing the evidence that had best far have been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.793" offset="1739609">There were president, representatives of the Manchester police and the state police and two Assistant Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.809" offset="1775658">Those officers presented to him what their investigation had revealed presenting it, the trial judge explicitly found to him in his capacity as the chief prosecuting officer of the state of New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.061" offset="1868654">No, there was no record made of that and none of what was said was under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.559" offset="1894672">Police Chief McGranery did testify during the trial on voir dier concerning what took place but there was no record and as I say it was not under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.219" offset="1941274">This was just I think quite genuinely, subordinates reviewing with the chief investigator and later prosecutor what they’d been able to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.044" offset="1984533">Then at the end of that conference after about two hours, we know from Chief McGranery’s description, he asked for an arrest warrant and four search warrants against the petitioner and the Attorney General having a commission as justice and peace, took Chief McGranery’s oath to the complaint and then he himself issued the five warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.901" offset="2108040">One of which we’re concerned with here, the warrant for an old Pontiac automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.438" offset="2234159">And that is not, I don’t want to overstate it, that is not the practice today because the statute has been changed but it was a settled practice at this time so this wasn’t denied, it happenstance apparently.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.540" offset="2310541">I don’t think it makes any difference here, there was a challenge to Mr. Coolidge’s arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.776" offset="2331544">It’s very clear in the headings to petitioner’s brief and the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.379" offset="2353904">That they challenged the arrest warrants on the same grounds as the search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.625" offset="2370936">It’s one of the black letter head things but as far as I can see it does not make any difference to our contention in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="577.649" offset="2415031">Both branches of your argument, your entire argument of course in this case depends upon the continuing validity of the exclusionary rule, does it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="585.257" offset="2445437">Oh yes, yes, I assume that and hope that I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.590" offset="2466753">I -- that evening, the petitioner was arrested in his house pursuant to the arrest warrant, or an hour and a half or two hours later, the Pontiac car was towed to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.003" offset="2536448">It was searched the next day and then again a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.551" offset="2562570">The search is important without going into the details because in the course of vacuuming the car, the police obtained tiny particles and later examined under a microscope which an experts sought to associate with particles that they said were substantially similar taken from the clothes of this unfortunate girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.898" offset="2671971">And the expert testimony was that there was some extraordinarily load, a high degree of probability that the body must have been in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.569" offset="2722649">This I would say, this evidence of which the Court first refused to suppress on our motion before trial and which was admitted over our objection pressed all the way through the trial an on appeal, was very essential to the prosecutions case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.772" offset="2791508">This is not conceivably a case where you could say that this was harmless error within this Court’s rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.359" offset="2817839">Indeed, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire noted three or four or five times the very dubious character of the evidence against the -- of the proof against the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.909" offset="2872069">On 265, it says the proof was not wholly free from weakness, then it speaks of how the limitations of time cast out on the state’s theory and how further doubts were cast by certain other evidence and how the ballistics evidence blow up to put it colloquially in the state’s face during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.967" offset="2956288">So that this, I’m simply emphasizing the importance of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.171" offset="2981052">Now, our first contention here is basically a very simple one --</text>

            <text syncTime="733.487" offset="3038312">No, I was simply negating any possibility that the rule, it’s the case decided the same day as Cooper in California, I can’t think of the name of it now, could be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.504" offset="3094424">That is that it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.488" offset="3102365">I think that isn’t true and I do emphasize that this was a very close case on the trial so that this evidence, --</text>

            <text syncTime="756.684" offset="3131099">Was important capital, that’s right, was important to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.800" offset="3151579">Now our first and primarily contention as I say, is that the admission of evidence obtained under the search warrant violated petitioner’s constitutional rights because the warrant which is issued by the Chief Prosecutor instead of a neutral and detached magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.123" offset="3240918">And I need hardly remind the Court that it has said over and over again since Johnson against the United States, Mr. Justice Jackson’s opinion that one of the indispensable conditions to a valid warrant is that the inferences from the facts which lead to the complaint be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.973" offset="3352304">The closest case unquestionably is Mancusi v. Deforte where the Court dealt with a subpoena duces tecum that had been issued by the District Attorney in New York and Justice Harlan in writing the opinion considered whether this would be – whether the evidence would have been admissible if the subpoena could be treated as a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.063" offset="3456690">And he said no and there was no dissent on that point in the Court because the District Attorney was not a detached and neutral officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.772" offset="3499530">Now, the state replies that Attorney General Menard before he signed the warrants took off his black prosecutorial hat and put on his white justice of the peace hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.225" offset="3565255">We think that that purely formal step did not, indeed could not confer on him a neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.112" offset="3600886">A disinterestedness under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.519" offset="3618440">He was I say inactive charge of this prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.107" offset="7800853">The two issues, search and seizure issues which have been raised here by the petitioner turned on the admissibility of -- or rather suggest that the vehicle which belonged to the petitioner and certain vacuum sweeping is taken from it subsequent to the time it came into the custody of the police were obtained by unlawful means because of the issuance of an invalid search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.222" offset="7901268">And secondly, that certain items of clothing particularly and a murder weapon, a weapon which was subsequently testified to as being the weapon which fired a fatal bullets was obtained, interrogation of his rights from his wife at the time when he was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.725" offset="7967305">Taking the first issue that the petitioner raises, we suggest that the petitioner is stressing form rather than substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.900" offset="7996040">The basis of their contention is that the search warrants were invalid because they were not issued by a neutral and detached magistrate since the magistrate so to speak who issued the warrants was the Attorney General who’s in charge of the prosecution then and subsequently who tried the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.694" offset="8075139">And the real issue we say is, were the petitioner’s constitutional rights affected or denied him in any way by what actually happened here, taking, looking at the substance of what happened, the Trial Court has specifically ruled that on the basis of the following facts, any magistrate, neutral and detached magistrate would have found probable cause and would have issued the search warrants under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.327" offset="11773659">As Mr. Cox pointed out, on January the 28th, when the police were conducting a very general investigation, not knowing who they were looking for or even what they were looking for in terms of a murder weapon and based on the report only of a neighbor that this particular individual, the petitioner in this case was not at home on that evening between 5 and 11 o’clock, they went to his home and asked him about where he was that evening, during the course of this visit, he freely discussed his activities on that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.460" offset="11890270">During the course of this visit, he took them out and showed them his cars and he brought out three weapons to show them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.908" offset="11940007">The police officers who were there listed the three weapons and neither of these weapons was the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.239" offset="11973339">While they were there, they asked him he would mind taking a lie detector test and he said no but he was a bakery truck driver and could not get off except on a Sunday so could it be on a Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.490" offset="12018375">And they set a date for the following Sunday which is February the 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.183" offset="12037078">On February 2, one of the officers that was there called him and he came down to the station voluntarily, they stayed at the station, this is at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, they stayed till about 3 to 3:30 talking about whether he should take a test or not and finally, he agreed to go with them to state police headquarters in Concorde.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.930" offset="12116072">Before or rather during the test, there, they turned them over to Sergeant MacBane at that time with the state police who administered the lie detector test which was inconclusive but in the course of administering the test, the petitioner admitted a larceny of $300.00 from his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.409" offset="12194022">The police then took the petitioner back to Manchester and since he had been giving him conflicting stories about where he was on that evening that he was out with a girl or that he was out with somebody else or that he had gone to another town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.267" offset="12253477">They kept checking what he told them and they stayed -- he stayed at the police station until 2 o’clock that morning and at 10 -- about 9 o’clock that evening, the sergeant came down from Concorde and talked to the captain in charged of the police station and he and another police officer, not the first two that were there on the 28th, went out to the “petitioner’s home to talk to the wife to verify one thing about the larceny that he had told them,” namely that he had bought a washing machine and secondlth y to discuss with her his whereabouts on the evening of the murder, January 13, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.206" offset="12413241">When they arrived there, the mother in law, the petitionr’s mother was there, they started to talk to the petitioner’s wife and the mother-in0law made some statements and the testimony is that she left at their request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.061" offset="12484608">After the mother-in-law left, the petitioner’s wife discussed this with the two police officers who were there namely about where the petitioner had been on that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.197" offset="12533196">They told her that they were conducting a general investigation, an investigation into the crime, the murder and at this point also, they had no knowledge of what weapons he had shown to the other two officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.274" offset="12589516">They had no knowledge of what particular weapon they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.084" offset="12604771">They asked her and told the petitioner’s wife that they were examining clothing and weapons, she volunteered that they -- that he had some riffles and asked if they would like to see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.164" offset="12665062">They said yes and she went into the bedroom and they followed her then she said I believed I asked them if they wanted the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.681" offset="12695155">In other words, the request for the -- to take the guns did not initiate with the police officers, it initiated with the petitioner’s wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.763" offset="12727442">And one of the police officers said no and the other one said we might as well take them, which is consistent with the finding of the Court that they did not at that point know what they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.649" offset="12767044">As it turned out later that evening and she brought out not three but four weapons, one of which turned out to be the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.760" offset="12799436">Later that evening at the police station, the other police officer who had been down at the ballistics laboratory returned about post of midnight and for the first time, at the time when they already have these four weapons at the police station, they know that they’re looking for a 22-caliber Mossberg rifle and he recognizes that there’s one on the bench of the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.349" offset="12897761">The evidence was that the petitioner saw his cloths and his guns at the police station that evening, in fact, the next morning offered to sell one of the guns to the one of the police officers, and it’s within this factual background that the petitioner raises the question of a search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.163" offset="12969023">The Trial Court ruled and the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the ruling that there was under these facts and circumstances, no search and no seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.305" offset="13005594">There was no quest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.266" offset="13009460">They did not go throughout the house looking for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.230" offset="13021268">In fact, it was only at the offer of the wife that they took the rifles with them and under these circumstances, the contention of the respondent here is that there was no search and seizure and if that’s the case, then there’s no issue for this Court to pass upon and the ruling of the court below should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.582" offset="13094724">But even assuming that there was a search or a seizure, under the law, it’s the contention of the respondent here that a wife has the authority to consent to a -- voluntarily consent to a search and seizure of her home that she has lawful control in the possession of and I think --</text>
