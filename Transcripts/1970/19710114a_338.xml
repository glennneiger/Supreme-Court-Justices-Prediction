            <label>Mr. Robert H. Rines</label>
            <text syncTime="17.697" offset="174164">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.605" offset="193808">To take one moment to introduce my father, teacher, and partner Mr. David Rines, my co-counsel from Chicago, Mr. Richard Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.750" offset="250337">This case involves a conflict of decisions between the Eighth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit with regard to the validity of a patent to Isbell dealing with television antennas, the type that I'm sure, Your Honors have seen cluttering our landscape on the roofs of houses which are very necessary in order to get good television reception in the homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.787" offset="394533">I have here typical antenna of the type I'm sure you’ve seen on the roofs, involving what we call dipoles, nothing magical about that, just little rods which are tuned and corrected in terms to dimensions and direction to receive from the television transmitting stations the signals that we tune into our television.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.733" offset="530265">In the Eighth Circuit, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found the Isbell patent which is owned by the University of Illinois Foundation to be invalid for obviousness in the light of the teaching of the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.661" offset="622007">The University of Illinois Foundation filed not just one suit, in the Winegard case which is at Eighth Circuit case, but filed the suit against Blonder-Tongue, a New Jersey Corporation in Chicago by suing a customer and joining Blonder-Tongue and a whole host of other manufacturers throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.966" offset="723257">When a decision went against them in the Winegard District Court and while they were appealing to the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, the University of Illinois Foundation pursued the suit against Blonder-Tongue in New Jersey, on exactly the same patent, there was also another patent involved and we went to trial before a Judge Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.495" offset="821373">One of the issues in our presentation is the fact that we were forced to this trial without the benefit of a single witness during the whole presentation of the University of Illinois' case in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.220" offset="888247">As a result of the fact that when we were ready in December 18th, the trial date with our Cambridge, Massachusetts expert who’d worked over a year on this with us, with Mr. Blonder, and various customer witnesses from all over the country and myself in Boston, the judge could not hear it on the 18th and he couldn’t set a time for postponement, 19th, 20th and 21st, we still didn’t have a trial date.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.414" offset="1013008">The result was that the day before Christmas the trial was set for two days after Christmas and I was not able to reassemble any of my witnesses and the District Court refused to give me a few days in which to this but forced us to go to trial without any witnesses at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.473" offset="1065253">Therefore, we were not able to produce any live witnesses on the issue of whether or not the Isbell patent was or was not valid for our business or any other reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.199" offset="1280188">Therefore, the record that has been produced in this case is only the documents that we were able to put in before Judge Hoffman which were the same documents before the District Court in the Eighth Circuit litigation, the Winegard litigation and we had to argue therefore from those documents without the benefit of any expert or any witnesses at all, these issues of obviousness and validity.</text>

Lowell in another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.304" offset="1824580">But in this particular case where we’re stuck with substantially the same documentary evidence, where we were not able to produce even that modicum of expert testimony that existed in the Eighth Circuit, we think there may be as suggested by the Solicitor General some reason for modification of that doctrine in a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.061" offset="1919666">The real question that is before this Court is on the matter of obviousness at the time that Mr. Isbell made his invention, what was the knowledge in the art?</text>
            <text syncTime="468.890" offset="1978911">What was the skill of the ordinary mechanic?</text>
            <text syncTime="471.676" offset="1990092">What have been known?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.378" offset="2000854">And we were very fortunate that one distinction between these two trials was that the University of Illinois at this time in Blonder-Tongue case chose to take in some prior investigators in this field namely Dr. DuHamel, who had pioneered this kind of antenna at the University of Illinois many years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.476" offset="2073266">So he was produced as a plaintiff’s witness and fortunately through cross-examination, we were able to get from Mr. DuHamel, admissions that we think bolsters this concept of complete and obviousness of this invention at the time that Mr. Isbell made it.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.865" offset="2158843">It is not for the edification of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.015" offset="2175457">There were two patents sued on by the University of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.554" offset="2189563">One was the Isbell patent, which is this kind of an antenna not this where these rods here instead of being off at an angle, come out straight, that’s Isbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.207" offset="2236165">Then they had a second patent the Mayes who just took these rods and bent them in this way into a “V.”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.981" offset="2263333">The District Court found both of those patents valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.762" offset="2274408">The Court of Appeals threw out the “V” patent saying it wasn’t invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.592" offset="2289768">So that's not an issue in the Supreme Court, it has not been appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.997" offset="2311398">However, one issue that is involved is that at the time that they obtained this Mayes patent in the Patent Office, counsel who were prosecuting both the Isbell and Mayes patents together filed an affidavit in the Patent Office which we maintain was fraudulent as a result of which this Mayes patent issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.251" offset="2404394">That affidavit concerned both inventions, both Isbell patent and the Mayes patent inventions and one of our contentions is that the Court of Appeals having reversed Judge Hoffman and find that this affidavit was less than candid and that it was deliberately given to mislead the Patent Office that one of the questions we raised is whether under those circumstances, there should be any standing in equity on either patents for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.892" offset="2514944">And also involved in our case is the fact that the minute, the fruits of this fraud were obtained, out in the market place they went with copious advertisements telling the whole world they invented the broad log periodic antenna, nobody else could make one and this coupled with a whole series of other acts almost put our client out of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.043" offset="2599581">So that we have a counterclaim which is in point 2, if you will, question number 4 now before this Court as to whether this is fair competition and whether this is not violative of the antitrust laws to take the fruits of an illegally obtained patent and use it the way it was used in the marketplace to suppress competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.017" offset="2679411">Turning back for the moment to the obviousness of the Isbell patent, at the time that Isbell made his invention, this whole magic of log periodicity had been invented long since as Judge Hoffman found, in the early 1950’s, at the University of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.165" offset="2752031">It’s very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.441" offset="2757151">What it means is that in order to have your television antenna, listen to all of the channels from the low frequencies to the high frequencies, we pit in a whole bunch of these antennas and we tuned them to different frequencies and if you shape them in the way that they go from the long wavelengths, down to the short wavelengths, just taper the shape, that’s a log-width variation, that’s all it means and if you space it also in accordance with the length that again is a log-width in variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.704" offset="2878151">Those principles and that discovery, we all admit was known before Isbell came into the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.149" offset="2903960">What then that Isbell claim was his invention?</text>
            <text syncTime="703.914" offset="2919006">“Uh-huh,” he said, other people while they have done that variation of having long shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter, while they have done that before, they didn’t do with the simple single wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.944" offset="2979192">They did it of what he calls “teeth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="720.861" offset="2986820">You see this a little a triangular teeth and they didn’t take and just use one wire instead of the tooth.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.394" offset="3024959">So this is supposedly what Mr. Isbell invented, but when Mr. Harris, their expert got on the stand, he admitted to us as shown in the record here that the ideas of these teeth or straight lines, or folded lines, these were all well-known dipoles, all well-known antennas and in fact, they all operate the same way to produce the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.993" offset="3135300">I would like to hold up for you from appendix, volume 2, if I may, page 475, the sketches that their witness, Mr. Harris put on the board and which we transcribed on the paper, 475 and 476 where he shows, if Your Honors please, First, the straight lines, that’s the straight line dipoles so-called of Isbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.030" offset="3279496">And up above what he shows what the current is, this loop dash line, that means the radio currents go across the antenna in that kind of a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.458" offset="3317217">Then on the next page, Mr. Harris, their expert, sketches these triangular loops such as I showed you in items 6 and he shows the same current distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.460" offset="3369253">And below that he shows that you could fold the wire into a rectangular loop and get the same current distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.113" offset="3395793">And there's no dispute but that all of these antennas were known long before Isbell, decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.339" offset="3420766">So, that the question resolves itself into, can you give us many patents as there are well-known types of antenna shapes by just magically putting them in this whole formula for log periodicity?</text>
            <text syncTime="844.230" offset="3480325">And this is what the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit found to answer in a negative, but this is what Judge Hoffman answered in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.030" offset="3519509">Now, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="856.708" offset="3530167">Judge Hoffman was impressed by Mr. DuHamel’s testimony that he was surprised that these straight line elements would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.263" offset="3572381">Though he said after he thought about it, he realized they would, but when was he surprised?</text>
            <text syncTime="873.678" offset="3598085">There is absolutely nothing in this record showing that it was not obvious at the time Mr. Isbell proposed to change from a thick antenna to a thin wire that it was not obvious and Judge Hoffman did not find that it was not obvious at the time Isbell made the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.160" offset="3680005">He just said, at some time it was not predictable whether these different kinds of things would work, but the statute says, we’re concerned in Section 103 with obviousness at the time of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.448" offset="3733191">And fortunately, we were able to put in a document which was contemporary that Mr. Isbell’s invention, a document of the University of Illinois Laboratory itself whereas we quote in our brief and we produce this only two pages long, in the first part, they say, “Now, we can predict from the mathematics the operation of multi-element log periodic antennas” and then on a lower paragraph it says, “Mr. Isbell is going to thin this down now into zero with almost little wires.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.657" offset="3869968">And that document itself contemporaneous not in the anticipation of lawsuits shows beyond any reasonable doubt even if these were criminal test that at that time it was completely obvious to those skilled in the art that Isbell’s trivial change was an experiment but not something that was unobvious to those skilled in the art.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.132" offset="4407881">You look at the scope of the prior art, you look at the claims, you compare the difference, you look at the skill of the man at that time and we feel this predictability issue comes in, in that skill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.259" offset="4588440">And at that, his confusion went to Mr. DuHamel talking about certain as esoteric structures that weren’t obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.205" offset="4620204">He didn’t say, “Making these particular little elements was an obvious.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.493" offset="4641311">Let me show you the testimony that he talked about when he spoke of an obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.618" offset="4681853">At pages 412 of volume 2 of the appendix, see this big conical structure, this sweeping fold going up into the air on page 413, this zigzag configuration, this vertical thing going up with all kinds of lumps on it, this is the testimony of Dr. DuHamel, these were the things he put in evidence to convince the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.172" offset="4828035">It wasn’t unpredictable that all, Dipole elements could be shaped in a log periodic and come out right, but he did not say that merely to take the prior thick antennas and make one wire of it wasn’t obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.041" offset="4899506">Now, in his cross-examination, Dr. DuHamel, witness for the University of Illinois admitted what I hold in my hand here which is defendant’s exhibit 24 is a correct representation of what he described in his prior patent, prior to Isbell, it’s prior up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.026" offset="4983515">If you'll notice, he has antenna dipoles that vary in length as we go down from long and short and spacings that vary long and short, the so-called log periodic spacing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.514" offset="5045478">This, believe it or not, is one of the Blonder-Tongue infringements and what is the difference, superficially?</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.384" offset="5088946">Instead of having triangles, we have straight lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.396" offset="5109008">If this was prior art, could the Isbell patent possibly be valid if it covers this, another equally well-known type of dipole?</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.439" offset="5149132">Just taking and thinning these triangular loops into single wires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.881" offset="5166895">We think the question answers itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.194" offset="5208168">We come now to summarize other points with regard to the invalidity of the Isbell patent and the non-infringement thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.359" offset="5256756">Every claim of the Isbell patent is restricted to the idea of putting of these antennas as close as you can in one plane, so-called coplanar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.193" offset="5296149">Judge Hoffman read out of the claims the word “coplanar” and found that a Blonder-Tongue antenna which is their principle ones which had dipoles deliberately in two widely space planes which is the Blonder patent not the Isbell patent, he found that that is all in the same plane, he doesn’t explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.924" offset="5383084">He found it all in the same plane and hence, he found the Isbell claims coplanar our claims to be infringed by this antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.004" offset="5415372">When we came to the Court of Appeals, they apparently couldn’t stomach that and so they made their own supposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.207" offset="5440240">They said apparently and all they were looking at was this antenna at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.704" offset="5462183">Apparently, they said, “You can’t physically build these two sets of antennas to get them in the same plane.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.697" offset="5490186">So, there has to be some separation about the order of an inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.741" offset="5506382">Hence they said, “We think coplanar applies to the Blonder-Tongue antennas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.704" offset="5530206">When we called to their attention that the real antennas of Blonder-Tongue are four inches apart and that has nothing to do with how close you can put these together, we can put them together much closer mechanically, but it’s an entirely different purpose, they just took the one-inch reference out of their decision but let it stand that that is coplanar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.892" offset="5610977">We submit that any such extension of the monopoly of a patent completely began to file history, completely beyond everything they have asked for strip the word “coplanar” out of the claims and to hold a new inventor to be infringing when it isn’t coplanar and doesn’t even do the same thing is improper, and that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="2022.265" offset="8192397">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.318" offset="8208593">The United States appears as amicus in this matter today solely on the question of whether or not or to what extent the Court should continue to adhere to the doctrine of Triplett v. Lowell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.283" offset="8288528">What Triplett held is that a determination of invalidity of a patent in a suit against one defendant does not preclude another suit upon the same claims against another defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.620" offset="8357804">The holding was on the ground of the common law requirement of mutuality of estoppel as no one can take advantage of an earlier judgment unless he would also be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.750" offset="8426350">Now, the Government’s interest in this matter is on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.688" offset="8454144">The Government is a very frequent party in patent litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.259" offset="8480371">The Government has serious responsibilities both for conducting and administering the patent system and for enforcement of the antitrust laws and of course the Government has a great interest in the courts and in the fair and efficient administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.240" offset="8572322">Now, if I may, at the outset, I would like to summarize our views and our position and then to discuss the arguments for and against the mutuality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.196" offset="8636165">During the last approximately 30 years, the strict doctrine of mutuality of estoppel has eroded very substantially both in the federal courts and federal questions as well as in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.832" offset="8726653">Until now, I think it’s fair to say it is no longer the majority rule in the general federal law and federal questions or in our most populist states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.185" offset="8780152">As matter fact, one New York Court of Appeals’ judge not to long ago called mutuality a dead letter under the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.652" offset="8821948">However, in the patent field, the lower courts have felt bound to follow the doctrine of Triplett v. Lowell and they had adhered to the mutuality rule saying from time to time that it was up to this Court or to the Congress to make any change in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.402" offset="8921004">This happened for example in this very case, in the opinion in the Seventh Circuit below, they questioned the soundness of the rule, but indicated it had to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.802" offset="8966562">It happened a short time ago in the case of Nickerson v. Kutschera in the Third Circuit where the Court of Appeals reluctantly followed Triplett, reversing the Delaware District Court and indicating its agreement that there should have been an estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.473" offset="9061230">Now, we do not suggest abandoning a rigid, strict mutuality estoppel rule only to replace it with another strict kind of rule such as for example in rem invalidity which apparently is the fear of the patent bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.532" offset="9149524">Instead, what we suggest is a loosening of the Triplett rule to permit pleading and consideration of a prior invalidity judgment as defense matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.883" offset="9210859">The language of Triplett expressly holds -- expressly prohibits the pleading of a prior judgment in so many words and we think that should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.280" offset="9276479">We would like the courts consider unilateral estoppel, if you will, and consider such claims on a case by case basis, giving due weight and regard to any factors that would point to unfairness or to an anomalous result by application of the estoppel doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.850" offset="9382745">Now, turning to the arguments in favor of abandoning the mutuality requirement, I think that the main argument is that it serves no useful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.366" offset="9436871">This criticism incidentally goes as far back as the works of Jeremy Bentham in the middle of the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.926" offset="9471039">He found that mutuality served no rational purpose and he said, “It was a maxim which one would suppose to have found its way from the gaming table to the bench.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.516" offset="9533419">In more recent times, in the landmark Bernhard decision, as the Supreme Court of California in 1942, an opinion by Mr. Justice Traynor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.576" offset="9581693">He likewise found no rationalization for the rule and he was unable to see and he said in the opinion by the public policy values of the res judicata doctrine, the certainty, the finality, the limiting of litigation, judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.072" offset="9655672">He could not see why these should fall before an artificial requirement of mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.269" offset="9692453">Now, it said that he might have invoked the indemnity exception to this rule in error and number or exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.133" offset="9727875">In fact, I think that in state still following the mutuality rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.265" offset="9744384">It’s fair to say it’s riddled with exceptions and the Bernhard case probably could have gone off on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.547" offset="9781582">But instead Justice Traynor attacked the doctrine in itself and if in particular, he felt that a estoppel should arise and should be usable by a defendant against a plaintiff who had had a full opportunity to try his claim and had lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.811" offset="9882624">As the courts, in both federal and state had followed Bernhard one after another, it’s clear that the crowded condition of dockets and the need for judicial economy has weighed heavily when the courts have considered the artificial concept and the lack of value to mutuality on the one hand and weighed this other considerations against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.066" offset="10015640">Now, specifically in the patent field the arguments against the mutuality I think are primarily three in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.373" offset="10056913">First, it’s argued that Triplett gives a bad patent, almost as much infants as a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.373" offset="10096828">Businessmen except a license, they pay a royalty to buy their piece despite the fact that a patent may once have been held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.388" offset="10140923">They do it to buy their piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.790" offset="10150536">To put it another way, the mutuality doctrine places obstacles in the way of eliminating bad patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.532" offset="10193481">I think it’s fair to say that this would be contrary to the policy stated by the Court in the recent Lear v. Adkins case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.919" offset="10415000">Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, I think that in view of the fact that petitioner does asked that the rule of the Seventh Circuit be upset, that it is up to this Court to determine the grounds on which it is upset and to determine what shall happen in the District Court if it -- the case is remanded and it would be our view that the matter should be remanded for the District Court to consider the Winegard litigation and to see what additional evidence, what hardship, why the District Court should not adhere to Winegard rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Williams A. Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3224.664" offset="13002062">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.958" offset="13011153">As I listen to petitioners standing before this Court, it sounded like he was asking for a trial de novo, that isn't the issues that we have before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.801" offset="13050546">There at the -- there was two trials on this one particular patent, the Isbell patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.304" offset="13072593">There were concurring findings made below by not only the Eighth Circuit, but also the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and we feel that this Court should go from that particular point rather than start over and review all of the facts in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.807" offset="13130585">For example in the concept of due process, this wasn’t even raised as an issue in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.213" offset="13160260">This is an argument that petitioners have brought up here but has not been raised as a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.379" offset="13180844">Therefore, I'm not going to pursue that because the concurrent findings below in the Seventh Circuit clearly held that there was no fraud so far as the endeavors of the University of Illinois Foundation regarding the prosecution of the Mayes patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.674" offset="13250017">I might point out so that this Court can properly view this matter in its proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.302" offset="13272586">The University of Illinois Foundation is an arm of the University of Illinois and as such does not manufacture nor sell anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.469" offset="13309262">Its sole function in particular instance is the function as a licensing agent to license antenna manufactures under the Isbell patent or any other patents they might happen to have in their portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.877" offset="13358895">Similarly, this question of the fraudulent affidavit, that affidavit was made as we contend that there was nothing fraudulent about at all, but that affidavit was made in the prosecution of the Mayes patent which is not even an issue here and from the standpoint of the courts below, they found that there was no fraud there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.676" offset="13446040">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said that that patent was invalid on the basis of obviousness that it was the result or the fruit of a fraudulent affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.584" offset="13489716">Now, let me get down to what I feel is the basic issue so far as why we’re up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.660" offset="13518033">We -- if I will -- if I’ll get a chance I’d love to discuss the Triplett v. Lowell because I have a lot of good points on that one, but my principle concern right here is the question of obviousness as equated to this concept of obvious to try test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.769" offset="13582399">You have to remember that in the end-result that Section 103 calls for the test to be unobviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.716" offset="13610193">But what we say is that predictability is a factor which goes into determining the question of obviousness so that you have to say -- you have to consider the obvious to try test versus the concept of predictability as it relates to the issue of obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.030" offset="13687515">Nobody is so naive in the patent profession to espouse the doctrine that unpredictability ipso facto gives you an ultimate result of unobviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.766" offset="13730461">You have to consider the not the platitude, but the end-result that we’re looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.262" offset="13756374">Predictability can be of kind or it can be of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.203" offset="13776227">When you talk about predictability, predictability can be in terms of routine experimentation or something that is predictable to the routine experimenter versus the unpredictability that arises from a situation which a pioneer inventor is faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.482" offset="13845295">Let me illustrate the routine type of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.592" offset="13857729">That was brought up in the case of -- in the Mandel v. Wallace, a case which was before this Court involving the incorporation of a corrosion inhibitor in a deodorant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.012" offset="13907466">The Court -- Supreme Court justifiably found that the incorporation of this corrosion inhibitor into this cosmetic was obvious because it should have been perfectly apparent to any routine investigator to investigate 1, 2, 3, or 4 corrosion inhibitors, try them in this particular cosmetic environment, as underarm deodorant environment and expect that they would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.422" offset="14013106">Therefore you have the concept of routine investigation, routine experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.210" offset="14036198">You couldn’t really predict absolutely that this corrosion inhibitor would work, but you had a reasonable expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.443" offset="14069112">Now, you go to the other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.754" offset="14078412">This is a predictability of degree which in my opinion and in the opinion of the Supreme Court we agree is unpatentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.211" offset="14116237">This is a routine type of experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.557" offset="14129612">Let's go and see what we had in the case of Isbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.139" offset="14143927">Isbell did not have this type of background prior art at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.286" offset="14160541">Mr. Marshall, if you have these two pencils and you get a blurred signal and so everybody realized that one of the problems is they’re together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.696" offset="14210173">So you separate them until you don’t get a blurred signal, could that be an invention?</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.960" offset="14231176">Mr. Justice you have reduced it is the over simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.821" offset="14246640">You can't do that, that is a generalized statement that I wouldn’t even answer yes or no because again I would have to depend upon experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.618" offset="14281853">If by virtue of separating these two space booms there was some teaching in the prior art that I was in clarified the signal is not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.663" offset="14318007">But on the other hand, where you have a situation like we have in the instance of the Isbell patent, not a question I think in all due deference to petitioner, he misstated this concept Mr. Justice Black because if the invention -- the Isbell invention does not merely go to the spacing of the booms, there are many other concepts involved in that which you can see from a review of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.316" offset="14420616">I don’t want to go in the claims because this is a completely complex and technical approach that we can spend three hours on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.090" offset="14447783">But basically, what you have in the instance of the Isbell invention is to complete unpredictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.593" offset="14477772">This was not only found by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found by Judge Hoffman, it was found where the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.029" offset="14503476">So for Mr. Rines or the petitioner to say that the end-result was predictable is wrong because there is a concurrent finding that it was not predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.673" offset="14546108">What we have is the instance not of taking a bunch of components because we have to recognize that just because the claimed invention is a combination of all elements, this doesn’t per se in make it invalid in accordance with the U.S. v. Adams doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.838" offset="14622699">We have a situation here where one did not know what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.731" offset="14642343">There was no big sign post, no guide post, which says log periodic antennas can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.427" offset="14673063">There was a concept and as a matter of fact the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Judge Stevenson was clearly erroneous in making that finding and found that there was no technique, no principle for designing log periodic antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.977" offset="14739310">What they found was that there is a principle of log periodicity, but this in and of itself doesn’t permit you to design a log periodic antenna only to design a log periodic structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.606" offset="14789778">The structures ,if you will look at the Jassik (ph) Handbook which is in 430 of appendix 2, you'll see you don’t have to look at it now, but there are a number of log periodic structures that were shown -- that were available, that worked as log periodic antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.786" offset="14862503">Jassik (ph) himself says that log periodicity is unpredictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.331" offset="14880684">Now, what you have is the dipole antennas, which were old, you have the transmission lines for connecting the dipole antennas, those were old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.924" offset="14923107">You have the spacing of the dipoles, you have the length of the dipoles, on the basis of this log periodic theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.398" offset="14952991">But, nobody in the prior art told you how to put all these elements together with the predictability that they would work.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney G. Faber</label>
            <text syncTime="4791.238" offset="19268315">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.842" offset="19286706">Of the three questions presented in the petition for writ of certiorari, namely the validity of the Isbell patent because it provided decisions, secondly the so called fraud and the strictures on JFD for utilizing certain patent legends, and certain patents in furthering its sales and three, the re-invocation of Graham against Deere because the Court of Appeals in this case had said that the District Court had not itself fully followed the formula, and set down in Graham against Deere with respect to holdings of obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.584" offset="19481684">JFD is of course primarily interested in number three where JFD is charged with patent infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.086" offset="19519718">Number two, where JFD is charged with unfair competition by itself and in cahoots with the very good – the University of Illinois and of course JFD is a licensee under the Isbell patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.918" offset="19574993">Now, the Blonder patent was brought into this Court on question three, when -- question three as raised in the petition which was granted by this Court asked by the requirements in the District Court, the due process and specific findings underlying the determination of obviousness in patent causes as laid down by the Supreme Court in Graham against Deere mandatory or just optional and ignorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.282" offset="19688469">This question cited the strictures by the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit and the Trial Judge, which had said the District Court did not describe the scope and content of the prior art, identified the differences between the prior art and claimed no stake at the level of ordinary skill in the prior art, something that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.722" offset="19774255">However, we did not get the whole story in the petition, nor do we get the whole story in the brief filed by the petitioner in which the petitioner says, page 63, the mere conclusion by the District Court that claim five of the Blonder-Tongue patent was obvious at the time it was made and is therefore invalid “is entirely unsupported by any special or subsidiary facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.032" offset="19895463">The fact this however, that, that appearance of that one sentence all by itself in the brief of the petitioner is the first sentence of a two-sentence paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.461" offset="19949171">And the second sentence of that two sentence paragraph by Judge Hoffman on Page 89 of the record says, “The alleged improvement was thwart by the following references in the prior art, one technical point number 52, two the Mayes and his (Inaudible) the prior art patent cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.890" offset="20038928">They used the word obvious in that one sentence which I had read first and then he said it was thwart by technical report number 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.987" offset="20071320">The Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit as I pointed out said they really wished that the Trial Judge had applied the rulings, the formula prescribed in Graham against Deere, and then it itself tried to follow its own rulings and it ended up by saying, page 70 of the record, “If we understand its position correctly”, this is the Court of Appeals talking, “Blonder-Tongue places chief reliance on the fact that while Isbell teaches that the two planes in which the dipole elements lie are to be close enough together, that the dipoles are substantially coplanar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.981" offset="20223248">Blonder teaches that the planes maybe separated by some distance, but less than the wavelength of the band.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.727" offset="20254281">And the Court of Appeals went on, “A substantial separation of these planes is clearly shown, however, in the 1961 publication cited by the court, that's quite below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.688" offset="20298167">Technical report number 52 of the Internal Laboratories, that's at the University of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.117" offset="20323871">So that we have certain circuits saying to Judge Hoffman, thou has not followed the rules of Graham against Deere and then saying, but we apply the -- we do exactly the same thing Judge Hoffman did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.278" offset="20388446">We find that technical report number 52 does the job in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.194" offset="20412165">Now, where will you have, as you know Your Honors, Section 102 of Patent Act says that if the invention is described in another printed publication, it may not be patent then.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.244" offset="20460335">Section 103 says that if it is obvious from one or more prior patents in publications then on a showing that, that was beyond the standing of ordinary skill, it maybe patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.639" offset="20521880">And Graham against Deere pointed out that when you are going to use 103, then as an appropriate administration of justice, so that the decision can be understood, please explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.893" offset="20566915">And this Court itself gave an example of such explanation in a later case, Anderson -- I fully believe that the Anderson-Black Rock Inc. against Pavement Salvage Co Inc. was decided by this Court in the way it was -- they set forth a very succinct and complete example of what the Court wanted when it said in Graham against Deere, that laid down the rules that the various other courts would follow because this particular case there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.057" offset="20699617">Now, when we turn however to the patent itself, and I asked those of you who are able to do so, to turn to page 39 of this yellow book, the supplemental appendix where you'll find a reproduction of an exhibit that wasn't produced until the -- at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.096" offset="20799718">This reproduction shows on the left side principal drawing of the Blonder-Tongue patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.042" offset="20835558">In the middle, the Claim 5, which is the only claim Blonder-Tongue has brought to this Court, and on the left side there is technical report number 52 that had been referred to by Judge Hoffman and had been referred to by the Court of Appeals and of course this chart draws a relationship between the claim and each of the two disclosures, Blonder-Tongue and the technical report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.284" offset="20948511">And you find that I don't want a pair of rigid longitudinal conductors held spaced to predetermined vertical distance apart in a vertical plain, is found in Blonder-Tongue of course, that's where the claim comes from, it is found in this technical report number 52 which has been published early enough to be a reference, there is no question there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.079" offset="21039731">First and second pluralities of dipole elements lying in corresponding first and second vertically spaced horizontal plains containing the respective conductors, it's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.627" offset="21077870">Right down the line, the spacing, the dipoles in separate plains, they are all there in each of these two things except one is a publication antedating the filing date of the patent about more than a year, and the other is the patent itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.692" offset="21142131">However, you'll notice in this chart, on item floor array, instead of being able to put in the statement that yes, this particular strain relief appears in technical report number 52, we ought to say no, but and we went to two references and let me explain a strain relief very, very briefly in the simplest terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.250" offset="21244322">When I have to change the electric plug in the toaster in my kitchen, and knowing that my wife may well pull that plug out by the cord rather than by the plug, that will tie a knot in the wire entering the hole in the plug before I connect those two wires to the screws on that plug, and now if that plug is pulled by the wire rather than by the plug, that knot that has been tied in the wire will bear against the hole and we won't be pulling the contacts out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.694" offset="21362186">So this strain relief is something that has existed from many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.592" offset="21389772">Blonder, who is one of the co-inventors here testified that the strain relief specifically had existed from many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.036" offset="21431568">The Court of Appeals said that Blonder admitted that all the other mechanical elements were old but the only sum total of all the other mechanical elements in this Claim 5 is this one item.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.391" offset="21484962">Blonder also testified and by the way, petitioner's brief makes much of the fact that Blonder is a master of science type of person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.289" offset="21540551">Blonder is of course the moving spirit in the petitioner, Blonder himself testified not only as an expert, but also testified that the ranger 3 antenna put out by Blonder was made in accordance with Claim 5 which is the only claim at issue in this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.324" offset="21612648">So when we look at the ranger 3 antenna, which by coincidence happens to be not exactly coincidence, I must confess, happens to be opposite page 40 of the same yellow book.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.542" offset="21665520">The ranger 3 antenna does not provide a strain relief or a means of anchoring that lead in on the antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.980" offset="21703241">So on page 2 of the brochure that goes along with the ranger 3, on second page, bottom of the first column, there is an instruction to the installer, lab electricians tapper around standoff as indicated by the dotted lines in B.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.353" offset="21776802">So the strain relief isn't on the Antenna when it is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.645" offset="21789968">The standoff shown up there at the upper-right on Page 2b is a means of supporting or spacing the lead-in from the vertical mass, and the vertical mass is not the antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.387" offset="21832913">The antenna sits on the vertical mass, and this Ranger 3, which according to Mr. Blonder was made in accordance with claim 5 of his patent, that is so without this strain relief, but sold within an instruction, put some tape around this bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.224" offset="21908250">So when Judge Hoffman said, in the second sentence of that paragraph I read to you, when Judge Hoffman said that it is thwart, that was the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.308" offset="21956629">He is either right or wrong, and having said it is thwart by Technical Board-52, if it is thwart, perhaps he might have said, yes, just while looked at a picture of myself, said, yes, it's got a nose, yeah, it's got two eyes, yes, it has hair, not too much hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.046" offset="22023607">But, when he says it's thwart, he is making a statement and when you take -- when in a later case or another judge should want to see what the basis for the decision was and simply gets a xerox copy of that reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.591" offset="22077733">And when the Court of Appeals said it is thwart except for some mechanical elements which Blonder admitted to be old, those mechanical elements added up to all of that single unit, the strain relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.638" offset="22141889">Now, I have a few seconds left.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.429" offset="22165086">In considering Question number 2, the charges of fraud, what nasty people JFD was, how JFD either let the Illinois, University of Illinois down the garden path, the vis-a-vis, I don't know, just keep in mind that when you read these charges, every single one of them is an allegation and every single one of them without a single exception is not supported by proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.244" offset="22256306">In the time left to me, let me just take up a few of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.584" offset="22269680">Number 1, JFD raided the Blonder-Tongue employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.574" offset="22285667">In the period that JFD was supposed to have raided the Blonder-Tongue employees, stolen them all away, 100 employees left Blonder-Tongue, 5 of those who had left came to JFD.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.156" offset="22336031">When Mr. Blonder was asked to list all of the antenna manufacturers, I think he was able to list six or seven, maybe there are 10 or 12 or 15 throughout the country, and why did as many as fired, 120 of those who left come to JFD.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.166" offset="22396008">Well, Blonder-Tongue is located in New York, JFD is located in Brooklyn, and I am sorry to say that not too many people want to live in New York, I am sorry, Mr. Justice Brennan, [Laughter] and not too many people want to live in Brooklyn, and when somebody is living in Westchester, on Long Island, he can commute almost as inconveniently to either place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.813" offset="22478660">In other words, there was proximity, and we've got -- and JFD got 120 of those who left.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.197" offset="22504155">Mr. Ballash (ph), Blonder says was given the job of keeping tabs on JFD.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.202" offset="22544175">Not only keeping tabs on JFD, he was supposed to be really fully in charge according to the allegations of the whole antenna division of Blonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.489" offset="22585344">The general manager of Blonder-Tongue testified that Mr. Ballash was a very angry man who left -- who complained for many years was reduced gradually in rank and finally left two years -- a-year-and-a-half before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.534" offset="22649501">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5643.988" offset="22679280">Well on that subject, my brother failed to tell you that even the District Court found that when Mr. Ballash, the head of our whole antenna program left, all of the records at Blonder-Tongue dealing with the customer relations, and the investigation that Mr. Balllsh was making for this very suit for the pleading, mysteriously disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.736" offset="22766320">I think also we should bring out who are these key people that were raided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.102" offset="22787741">You cannot compare the fact that in a factory you let so many people go when you have production and so many people come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.983" offset="22811355">It's not a numbers game for raiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.949" offset="22819192">They took the head of the antenna business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.001" offset="22827342">They took all of our proofs and records with regard to the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.505" offset="22841344">They took our co-inventor of the Blonder patent who was going to testify about the infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.664" offset="22862033">He took all the tests, and this was taken just before the trial maybe a month or so before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.505" offset="22885439">In addition, we had one bit of evidence on the West coast about customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.427" offset="22905083">They took away just before the trial Mr. Sisson (ph), our West coast sales representative, so we couldn't use him as a witness.</text>
