            <text syncTime="103.330" offset="516681">Neither alone, as I said, or taken together were these offenses punishable by a jail sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.486" offset="541341">Petitioner was tried on two of the traffic offenses in 1966 in the Houston Corporation Court, a court whose jurisdiction is limited by statute to offenses punishable by fine alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.983" offset="595257">He was convicted on the two offenses and fined $75.00, but the judgment was not executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.481" offset="621275">This was explained by petitioner at the subsequent habeas corpus hearing on the ground that he had paid a lawyer to appeal the convictions. In fact, the lawyer failed to perfect the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.399" offset="668923">If the appeal had been perfected, petitioner would have been entitled to a trial de novo in the county court and relieved, at least temporarily, from the obligation to pay the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.132" offset="715943">Instead, as I’ve said, the convictions became final, but there’s nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner ever knew that this had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.196" offset="752201">Petitioner’s attorney incidentally has since been disbarred for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.276" offset="776443">Petitioner was not tried on the remaining traffic tickets until August 7, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.615" offset="805804">He appeared then in the same corporation court, the court with jurisdiction only to punish by fines, and he pleaded guilty to the other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.368" offset="844884">The judge imposed fines which when added to those outstanding from 1966, totaled $425.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.393" offset="880933">Petitioner being indigent was unable to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.907" offset="899009">Pursuant to Texas statutes and the Houston Code, he was dispatched forthwith to the Houston Prison Farm to serve 85 days in jail, or one day for each $5.00 of the fine, the statutory rate in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.070" offset="963688">The relevant statutes are found on page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.332" offset="980720">Now, this was on August 7, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.723" offset="998275">On August 28, 1968, petitioner commenced a habeas corpus action and was released the same day on a bond posted by a friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.000" offset="1039339">He had served 21 days and the unpaid fine was now $320.00 which would subject him to 64 additional days in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.899" offset="1106944">The hearing on the habeas corpus petition was held in the County Criminal Court on August 30, excerpts from the record of which appear in the back of petitioner’s brief, not in the brown appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.117" offset="1159816">The certiorari petition contains the entire record of the habeas corpus petition -- of the habeas corpus hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.648" offset="1190013">The County Criminal Court denied the habeas corpus petition and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed and the case then came here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.771" offset="1230451">There’s one further important factual point I’d like to make at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.289" offset="1248528">Although the state in its brief seems to dispute the fact that petitioner was indigent as of August 1968, when he was sent to jail for nonpayment of the fine, it is in fact perfectly clear from the record that the state had stipulated during the hearing in the habeas corpus petition that petitioner was “poverty stricken and that his whole family has been for all periods of time therein, and probably always will be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.998" offset="1359391">This is in the appendix brief, page 7a.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.487" offset="1601285">One is, if he has the possibility of earning some money to stretch out the fine over a period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.881" offset="2186846">Now, the A.B.A., the commission to study the federal penal code, all examined this extremely difficult problem because on the one hand as I’ve indicated, the state should not be powerless to proceed against an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.388" offset="2240972">On the other hand, the underlying principle of the Williams case as I understand it is that for the person who is without funds to put him into jail immediately, which is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.581" offset="2293739">There was no hearing, there was no exploration of the possibility of using these other techniques, we say that in a situation like this, the court should deal carefully, to use the phrase that Mr. Justice White used in his concurring opinion in the Morris case, with the man who is without funds, not exempt him, not exempt him because as I think the Chief Justice’s opinion pointed out, there could be a reverse discrimination in the case of a person who is indigent who won’t be able to be proceeded against in any way at all, we are not claiming that.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.456" offset="2441174">We’re saying that if a man has, as this man had, fines totaling $425.00 or whatever the sum would be that the lower court must deal with that person individually, that there must be a hearing, this also is suggested by the A.B.A. and by the commission to reform the criminal law, and deal with him in terms of his particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.062" offset="2535633">It’s possible in this case for example since he was getting a veteran’s check I think of a $104.00 a month that he would’ve been able to pay out the fine say $5.00 a week or something of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.800" offset="2586624">The infirmity in the procedure here we’re suggesting is the immediate transference of an individual who is poor to jail without exploration of the various alternatives that were reviewed in the Williams case.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.877" offset="3574888">The fact of the matter is I think Mr. Justice Blackmun that many states now provide for the kind of arrangement that we are suggesting and some of those as I understand it to have -- have not changed the law regarding to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.951" offset="3647195">But I would like to emphasize one other point which I think is related to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.470" offset="3669243">The state makes much of the point and I think that perhaps one or two of the questions that have been asked indicate a concern about it that this is a scuff law.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.844" offset="3706755">That this is a fellow who’s just oblivious to the normal restrictions that all of us would feel are binding in connection with operating a motor vehicle or a license, and therefore, perhaps he should go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.866" offset="3766836">Now our position on that is two-fold. One that the state, as you suggest, can provide for jail sentences in cases of this kind, repeaters, people who are chronic violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.790" offset="3818559">The State of Texas, the legislature of the State of Texas has not chosen to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.799" offset="3842591">The second point I would -- but we are emphasizing that that would be a perfectly valid mode of correctional philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.587" offset="3881671">The second point we would emphasize on this problem of, to use the word the state uses, the scuff law, is that if people are going to go to jail for being scuff laws, rich people should go to jail as well as poor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.424" offset="3941021">That if a fellow were a playboy or a fellow who had some money in one way or another and violated the traffic laws of the State of Texas, and I assume there have been some people who’ve done that in Texas as well as in New York and other states, we say that the law should be applied equally to the rich and the poor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.031" offset="4143522">I might say in connection -- in terms of the state’s interest, the state at several points and very understandably from its viewpoint, suggest that this would be terrifically inconvenient for the state to do, terrifically inconvenient to do the kinds of things that the A.B.A. has suggested, that the commission to reform the federal law, Federal Criminal Code has suggested that Maryland now does, that Delaware does, that California does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.747" offset="4258356">Now, we say that that is -- that the inconvenience problem is to use the vernacular, a red herring, that all the state already has a probation apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.512" offset="4321468">It already has people who are concerned with sentencing -- the statutes of the State of Texas provide incidentally for installment payments of fine above $200.00 in another connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.610" offset="4385834">If you are fined above $200.00 and there’s a conditions for probation -- as a condition for probation, the court is in powered under the Texas Criminal Code to provide for installments that they don’t -- that the state doesn’t find that inconvenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.936" offset="4455111">And the American Bar Association which went through for all of this, at great care, concluded that it is not too much to ask in the interest of equal protection to treat the people without funds of little bit more carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.405" offset="4537031">I might say, I pass the point by, I suppose it may have been implied in what I said that this case is really like Williams in the critical respect that the maximum sentence that can be provided for offenses of this kind is zero days, which brings it within the opinion of the Chief Justice and the concurring opinion of the due process theory by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.625" offset="6021831">At the outset, we would like to discuss what this case does not concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.329" offset="6044714">It does not concern any troubles that Preston A. Tate that may have had with his lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.694" offset="6066134">We think that this is not in the case nor is it -- does it involve any arbitrary action on the power of the State of Texas in charging $2.00 for a driver’s license, that’s not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.453" offset="6125171">The case actually boils down to the fact that this man, Preston A. Tate, ran a red light in the City of Houston and the policeman stopped him and as part of their routine procedure, they asked him to show his driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.871" offset="6186820">He didn’t have a driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.009" offset="6195388">He went in to corporation court, plead not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.827" offset="6206673">The jury found him $50.00 -- fined him 50 on one offense, they could’ve gone at 200, they fined him 25 on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.042" offset="6243558">That very same day at 6 p.m. that evening he ran a stop sign and fortunately, a policeman saw him and stopped him and again he was arrested, and then subsequently he ran up a total of nine traffic offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.325" offset="6484720">He ran a stop sign and again was arrested, or given a ticket, he wasn’t arrested and that is something else that we would like to point out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.219" offset="6528293">They say that he was immediately and forthwith taken to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.709" offset="6550235">He, over two years, expired between the time of these offenses and the time of his habeas corpus hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.126" offset="6583881">And although he might have had a wife and child at the time -- and two children at the time of the habeas corpus hearing, he had no children when he committed these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.621" offset="6621811">In other words, there was enough time lag in there for him to father two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.462" offset="6641246">So I don’t think the State of Texas has really been forthwith on this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.833" offset="6662666">In fact, I think perhaps we could be -- if we were to be criticized, we could be criticized in dragging our heels, and not bringing this thing to the head before now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.107" offset="6711777">Another thing in the petitioner’s brief, they question the jurisdiction of our corporation court and I think he answered his question when he stated that the corporation court could put a man in jail after he had failed to pay his installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.074" offset="6783666">Well now, if we can put him in jail after failing to pay the installments, we could -- we’d have the jurisdiction beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.806" offset="6810624">And besides, our Texas Supreme Court and Texas Code of Criminal Appeals says that the corporation courts and the JP courts have the right to enforce their orders by incarceration, and I don’t -- that is in our briefs, and I don’t think that it would serve any purpose to argue that further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.072" offset="11143711">And then does he propose that in addition to having Solomon setting judgment on this that then we have another hearing on -- say that I have a $2.00 parking meter violation in the City of Houston and I go down there say “I’m too poor” then are we going to have a separate hearing on my guilt vel non.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.440" offset="11257083">And then another hearing on whether I was telling the truth when I said I was too poor?</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.403" offset="11312985">And another thing, if we have these installment payments, the people are going to start getting behind that’s just human nature then we’re going to have all sorts of Civil Rights cases coming up about our -- the way our deputy clerks go out and try to collect the fines that they used harsh language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.815" offset="11434611">And I think that before we stretch the Fourteenth Amendment to mean something that clearly was not written in it, I would like to leave in parting with the idea that the poor people in Houston in Texas outnumber the rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.506" offset="11505351">They’ve got the ballot and the suffrage, and if they think the way we have collected their fines is wrong, they can elect city councilmen and state legislators to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.425" offset="11557073">That the poor people of Texas have not done so would be indicative that this law and the way we carry it out is not oppressive and is not unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.925" offset="11611094">But especially since the Fourteenth Amendment did not have the -- and I would like also to point out that the same Congress that wrote the Fourteenth Amendment was also the same Congress that passed on our constitution, and that we had to submit that constitution and ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before we could get back in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.579" offset="11717674">That same Congress that wrote the Fourteenth Amendment thought our state constitution was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.663" offset="11742020">And we submit that this is strictly a matter of local concern and that it would be beyond the wildest stretch of imagination to require the State of Texas to -- and the City of Houston to set up this installment payment, But Your Honors if you do, please tell us exactly how to work it because the District Courts are going to be working overtime each one with the mutually conflicting subjective idea of what a proper installment should be and the proper collection procedure should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.922" offset="11899068">And I can see of all three-man courts being convened all over Texas and all over the nation for matter, trying to determine whether the installment payment met the hood cost of living index or whether we should go on the guaranteed minimum income as an index for fiscal or in penal responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.171" offset="12220061">I think that first of all that some of the catalogs of alleged horrors that my friend from Texas has referred to are really unrealistic, and I would just refer the Court rather than go in to the details to the case cited in our reply brief, Arthur v. Schoonfield which is the Maryland case that was back on remand from the Morris v. Schoonfield case, in which the three-judge court, there are only two judges sitting, the three-judge federal court reviewed in detail the new Maryland statute and showed, I think, very clearly in that statute and in the way the court discusses it how this method of collection can work consistently with Williams and Illinois and without undue burden on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.367" offset="12400828">I’m advised by my co-counsel from Texas that the P. Farm that was referred to that is not discussed at all in the record, is not really what -- I had first thought my friend from Texas was referring about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.690" offset="12458088">As I understand it from Texas council that everyone goes to the P. Farm, the so called P. Farm, but the people who work there, who agree to work get $7.00 a day for working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.501" offset="12513364">Now, that’s not the same thing as I was suggesting before, because what we were suggesting before was, absent the willfulness problem which I certainly want to reemphasize that the state is not powerless under the constitution to incarcerate somebody who willfully refuses to pay the fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.818" offset="12682637">But 24-hour a day confinement is not necessary in the absence of willfulness to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.854" offset="12710745">And as I said a moment ago, the Maryland case and the Maryland statute I think make this abundantly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.808" offset="12738644">Another case recently decided by the Supreme Court of California almost unanimously which is in the appendix to our reply brief, the Anzano case reaches the same conclusion.</text>
