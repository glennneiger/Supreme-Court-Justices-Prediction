            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Williams, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="5.083" offset="123695">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.302" offset="144593">On September 10, 1960, a column appeared on the Concord, New Hampshire Monitor Patriot syndicated and distributed by the Northern American Newspaper Alliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.192" offset="224110">The column discussed and reported upon the upcoming New Hampshire Democratic senatorial primary race. The column had been written by the late Drew Pearson.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.696" offset="290147">The column reported that there were three candidates vying for the Democratic Nomination to oppose the Republican incumbent the late Senator Styles Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.438" offset="341138">Those candidates were Professor Herbert Hill, a Dartmouth college professor, a respected political figure in the State of New Hampshire and clearly the front-runner in the race; one Alphonse Roy who became the plaintiff in this cause in the court below; and one Frank Sullivan who is release from the Grasmere County Jail after his 19th conviction for public drunkenness had been obtained on the eve of the last filing date by candidate Roy, so the column reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.786" offset="522533">The column further reported that candidate and plaintiff below Roy had induced and procured Sullivan’s candidacy as a means of attracting an ethnic vote away from Hill and that Candidate Roy had done this in consort and complicity with the Republican incumbent the late Senator Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.718" offset="642278">The column characterized candidate Roy as “a former small-time bootlegger, later U.S. Marshal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="149.346" offset="700792">Two other candidates also (Inaudible) of the New Hampshire Jail system had been disqualified by the New Hampshire Ballot Commission, so the column reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.012" offset="755440">Roy promptly filed suit in the New Hampshire courts naming that Concord Monitor Patriot as a defendant and naming North American Newspaper Alliance as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.278" offset="812492">He alleged three specific libels.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.577" offset="825657">First, the characterization of him as a former small-time bootlegger; secondly, the fact that he had induced and procured Sullivan as a candidate; and thirdly, the fact that he had done so in complicity with the Republican candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.274" offset="916459">After trial, the jury returned the verdict for the plaintiff against both Concord Monitor Patriot and North American Newspaper Alliance solely upon the characterization of Roy as a former small-time bootlegger and that defamation is the only alleged defamation germane to the appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.725" offset="1034324">It is our contention, if the Court please that the trial judge and the New Hampshire Supreme Court misread, misgauged, and misconstrued the language of this Court in Garrison against Louisiana decided in 1964.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="248.417" stopTime="250.100">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="248.417" offset="1097017">How much was the verdict?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="250.100" stopTime="458.137">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="250.100" offset="1103809">It was $10,000 against each defendant Mr. Justice, an aggregate of $20,000 which is permissible under New Hampshire law.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.467" offset="1153233">The trial judge, if the Court please gave the jury what was a bifurcated instruction on the law of libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.273" offset="1200462">He told them that if they found that the characterization of Roy as a small-time bootlegger was on a par with the criticism of a public official for the misconduct of his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.247" offset="1280397">Then New York Times against Sullivan would be applicable and it would be necessary for the plaintiff to show malice that is the falsehood was uttered with knowledge of its falsity or with a reckless cavalier disregard as to its truth or falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.630" offset="1361899">Trial judge did not stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.612" offset="1373811">He went on and told the jury that they may find that the libel was in what he characterized as the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.765" offset="1410382">He said that if the alleged defamation had no relevancy to Roy’s fitness for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.032" offset="1443506">If it was merely a bringing forward of his long forgotten past misconduct, if it was on a matter in which the public had no interest then it was a private libel and New York Times v. Sullivan would not be applicable and in that case, the plaintiff might recover unless the defendant successfully asserted one of two defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.012" offset="1555414">He then told them what the two defenses were under the law of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.305" offset="1576626">The first one was justification and the second one was conditional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.612" offset="1605778">He then went on to describe the defense of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.616" offset="1617795">He said that the defendants could prevail if what they said was true and if it was uttered with good motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.147" offset="1671920">Secondly, he told them that the defendants might prevail if the defense of conditional privilege obtained and he said that they could avail themselves of conditional privilege even if what they have uttered was untrue if it was uttered with a reasonable belief in its truth, a reasonable basis for believing it to be true and if it were uttered with justifiable purpose and good motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.001" offset="1807339">He told the jury that if they found the characterization of Roy to have been a public libel in the public sector under New York Times v. Sullivan then they must exonerate North American Newspaper Alliance because there have been no showing whatsoever of malice against North American Newspaper Alliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.222" offset="1896260">Obviously, the jury found the libel to have been in the private sector because it returned verdicts against each defendant in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="458.137" stopTime="482.769">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="458.137" offset="1935966">The second -- the alternative part of the charge instructing the jury as to the conditions under which they could find liability if this were not a public libel did not, that part of charge did not purport to have any reference to the United States Constitution, did it? That was purely a matter of New Hampshire case law or statute law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="482.769" stopTime="483.795">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="482.769" offset="2034500">Exactly Mr. Justice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="483.795" stopTime="493.283">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="483.795" offset="2038575">The theory being I suppose that if it were that kind of a defamation it was -- the United States Constitution had no impact whatsoever upon it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="493.283" stopTime="633.102">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="493.283" offset="2076505">That’s exactly right sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.558" offset="2085595">Now, it’s our contention, if the Court please that the trial judge committed error of constitutional dimension when it permitted the jury to find that this characterization of Roy could be a so-called “private libel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="515.296" offset="2164590">It is our contention, if the Court please that the rule which applies to public officials for defamations concerning the discharge of their public duties namely that the defamation must be shown to have been made with malice before recovery can be made applies a fortiori to a candidate for public office whether he aspires to executive, legislative, or judicial office.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.124" offset="2275871">It is our contention, if the Court please that the logical sequel to New York Times against Sullivan is that defamations against candidates for public office, so long as they relate to the fitness of the candidate for office, so long as they are within the ambit of public discourse and dialogue regarding the qualifications and background of the candidate, have a constitutional protection unless uttered maliciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.093" offset="2391751">This Court when it articulated New York Times against Sullivan cited immediately with approbation a case which have been cited for almost half a century with approbation by many state in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.407" offset="2452982">It dealt with a candidate for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.233" offset="2464266">It was the case of Coleman against MacLennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.737" offset="2478268">And in that case, eloquently and articulately, and precisely is stated what we contend should be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.322" offset="2512645">There the court said it’s of the utmost consequence that the people should discuss the character and qualifications of candidates for suffrages.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.840" offset="2546709">The importance to the State and to society of such discussion is so vast and the advantages derived is so great that they more than counter-balance the inconvenience of private persons whose conduct may be involved and occasional injury to the reputation of individuals must yield to the public welfare although at times such injuries may be great.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.102" offset="2635734">I suppose you contend the very least this time as a public figure not a public official.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="675.174" offset="2804067">Well, this Court in Curtis Publishing Company against Butts divided, as I read the opinion, with respect to the rule that should apply to public figures as against public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.001" offset="2855372">I say that there is no reason for division here because certainly a public candidate for public office should be treated as a public official.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.102" offset="2911796">I think the rule that applies to a public official on defamations concerning the discharge of his duties should apply to a candidate who aspires for such office because I believe that when a candidate announces for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.365" offset="2968848">He lays his life before the press for scrutiny and I believe that anything in his life is relevant to his fitness for office, his private life or his public life.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.820" offset="3022660">His character, his mental and physical health, his record whether it be academic, professional, commercial, social, marital, or criminal, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.393" offset="3072920">I believe that all of that is appropriate for public discourse and that there is a constitutional protection surrounding the discourse so long as it is within the ambit of dialogue relating to his background, his qualifications or his fitness for office.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.928" offset="3195068">In Curtis Publishing Company against Butts where the Court discussed in great detail the doctrine relating to public figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.401" offset="3240939">As I read the opinion, four justice of this Court felt that there should be a rule of highly unreasonable conduct applicable to the press before a recovery could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.957" offset="3299244">Other justices felt that the New York Times rule applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.548" offset="6681579">Let me start where my brother Williams left off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.225" offset="6700283">And let me start out by answering Mr. Justice Brennan’s question what was the situation factually disclaim a bootlegger was totally false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.302" offset="6748557">Totally false, it wasn’t even close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.946" offset="6771127">Now here’s the one brush with the law that my client had over 68 years of life, the majority of his adult life being public life and public office including being a Congressman, being twice a member of the Executive Council of my State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.977" offset="6839254">In 1923, one of his brothers was running one in those days was known as a Near Beer Joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.948" offset="6875199">Now those of us who remembered Near Beer remember that it really wasn’t much of a drink unless you had a shot to put in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.813" offset="6906650">And the local police officers thought that the brother Emmanuel not this plaintiff below, not this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.687" offset="6934131">But they thought that Emanuel probably was selling an occasional shot of whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.554" offset="6961612">So they sent a spy to him and the spy got a shot of whiskey and he has to preserve that evidence because that’s going to be the evidence on which they’re going to rock up Emanuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.127" offset="7007901">So he takes the shot of whiskey in his holding under the bar when the rest of the by squad breaks in, in a big rush.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.511" offset="7037367">And this is in the record, they jumped over the bar, hit the bartender in the nose, and grab the bottle out of which the shot was poured and they got Emmanuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.157" offset="7076028">No question about it and they’ve also got Oscar who was acting as bartender at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.626" offset="7097866">In the rush of people coming in and people inside trying to get out somebody jostled the arm of the officer who was carefully holding the evidence and spilled the shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.034" offset="7147499">And the officers coming in said, Alphonse Roy did that and we want him over the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.634" offset="7165889">We’re going to charge him with interfering with a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.791" offset="7178533">He went over to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.021" offset="7187414">No charge was ever filed, Captain Gorrie running the by squad told him, “Look Al, would you see if you can’t get your brother out of this racket, he shouldn’t be doing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.482" offset="7233285">And Alphonse, this is the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.278" offset="7244466">He had been trying to get his brother out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.785" offset="7254497">And with the assistance of another Frank or American Professional man in the area after he paid this fine, he did get out of it and went back to an honest living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.386" offset="7292949">Now that is the total evidence on which either 37 or 26 years later, during a period when this man was in vicious political campaign and nobody ever made this suggestion that (Inaudible) Publishers that this man was a former small-time bootlegger.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.719" offset="10598275">He did this because the defense below although they were orders to make this clear successfully avoided letting the court know whether or not Pearson was the real party in interest defendant and therefore chargeable with his own acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.790" offset="10662536">When they came to this Court, by letter they acknowledged that Pearson was the real party in interest defendant by a letter to Judge Brennan asking for an extension which they have been unwilling ever to say to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.948" offset="10723140">The factual background between Pearson and this people is that Pearson by contract would NANA writes, NANA is not permitted to change his writings and has affirmatively obligated to spread it out to the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.484" offset="10785311">And if there is any light, Pearson indemnifies NANA and in this case also indemnifies the Monitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.440" offset="11577135">May I add other thing and it bears on what the point that you bring out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.984" offset="11599287">Pearson testified under oath that he didn’t make this publication for the purpose of instructing the voters at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.037" offset="11635545">Now you’ll find that at page, I think its 190 194 perhaps, and again at 183.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.333" offset="11688730">What he said was that he was writing this for a national consumption and had no intention at all to affect the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.836" offset="11734706">So you get this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.417" offset="11749021">The defense is that since this man is running for public office, anything that’s said about him to help the voters or to help persuade them should have this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.279" offset="11800534">And the man who wrote it said that isn’t what I was writing it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.503" offset="11817357">The only reason that it was published on the Saturday before the election was that general reader interest in this type of thing is highest then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.984" offset="11851316">In other words, the column has more salability then it would a week or two later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.406" offset="11877021">But there was no effort to use this Pearson says, to influence voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.291" offset="11904502">Now as to whether or not it was relevant whether to the election campaign, bear this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.307" offset="11932609">Nobody in the election campaign itself ever used this bootlegger charge at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.518" offset="11957478">That Hill camp that this article might have helped, they never put out a word claiming any bootleg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.546" offset="11993527">That’s the vicious thing about this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.887" offset="12006902">You can say I think and it’s difficult to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.852" offset="12026755">You can say almost anything about a candidate may have some relevance to his fitness, almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.334" offset="12064684">And if it is used for the purpose of helping the voters make their decision, then it should have some higher standing than as if it is published a month afterwards for the purpose of making some other story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.724" offset="12142320">What happened here was that Pearson claimed that Sullivan was a (Inaudible) after a hearing had been had on it and at which he was held not to be a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.784" offset="12186520">So this is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.413" offset="12197073">At that hearing, the theory of the Hill forces was that Roy had procured all three of them and that wasn’t substantiated so that again is false he throws it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.774" offset="12246497">Nobody really believed that Senator Bridges would fool around with these democrat candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.590" offset="12273768">The three of them together couldn’t have elect him and they didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.197" offset="12284113">It wasn’t that close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.357" offset="12292786">The evidence is that as National columns throws big names in to attract attention to his column that’s why Bridges is in there and he had three people with criminal records who had filed for this off of it, Sullivan, McCarthy and Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.657" offset="12357987">And he wanted one more to make this story that much better and he made my client Roy into a criminal for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.607" offset="12393827">In the information that he got at the time he got this information he was told that Roy had been a U.S. Congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.518" offset="12429458">He was told that Roy was a responsible public officer and a responsible businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.970" offset="12463208">He left that out and he deliberately substituted, this is something like the Pope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.224" offset="12492257">It’s something like Wasserman and Ragano.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.098" offset="12503751">He knew that Roy was actually a responsible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.420" offset="12521096">He deliberately maligned him and degraded him not for the purpose of helping the voters one bit but for the purpose of selling that column throughout the United States, and you take his word for that, not mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.834" offset="12590686">This is the part that this Court is going to have to face up to it sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.701" offset="12610226">You cannot assume that publishes are publishing with proper motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.250" offset="12640423">Motive may be a bad word in this Court but in good faith and for our proper purpose those two things have always been the underlying basis for allowing the privilege and where the person claiming that privilege does not make that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.249" offset="12720358">I say, there’s no basis for this or any other court in this county saying that the injured person who has a constitutional right of equal magnitude to be -- to a remedy for that damage, to send that person away remediless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.234" offset="12796322">Unless the Court has questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.095" offset="12935711">The word is quoted in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.332" offset="12944697">If you’ve decided that it’s a private defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.453" offset="12961207">The plaintiff would be entitled to recover unless the defamatory matter was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.514" offset="12997465">Now justification is established if the facts stated are true and are published with the justifiable motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.092" offset="13043754">So the jury was given free license to find that this publication was not with a justifiable motive and even thought the allegation was true, they could have been brought in a verdict in this case for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.558" offset="13093595">Now, the counsel concedes that New York Times v. Sullivan is appropriate here for application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.282" offset="13124524">So what counsel is arguing to this Court is that under New York Times against Sullivan that its possible that an alleged defamation may be true and yet a recovery may be had --</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.132" offset="13519914">If the Court please, counsel said in quoting the record, “that the columnist Pearson did not write this to influence the electorate but rather wrote it in a purely private vain,”</text>
