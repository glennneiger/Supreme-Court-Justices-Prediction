            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3.447" offset="119160">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.503" offset="131385">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which affirmed in Court and reversed in Court a decision of the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina by decision in which Judge Sobeloff dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.784" offset="208603">The issue is one of statutory construction of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the particular statutory provision for which I would like to draw the Court's attention appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.347" offset="282791">The statute makes it unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against him with regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.000" offset="329394">And then in Section 2 which more particularly applies to the issue we have pending here to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunity or otherwise adversely affect the status as an employee because of race and other forbidden reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.156" offset="430017">The question presented in this case is whether intelligence tests and a high school graduation requirement may be use as a pre-requisite to promotion from the job of laborer to the job of coal-handler and perhaps other jobs at respondent's power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.465" offset="507235">When these tests, that is the intelligence tests which I might say was adopted on July 2, 1965, the effective date of the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.880" offset="552897">When these tests screen out Negroes at a significantly higher rate than they screen out whites and there has been no demonstration that the tests and the high school requirement predict ability to do the job and indeed there is some evidence to the contrary that they do not predict the ability to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.991" offset="637430">Now, the court below held in the case of employees employed after the high school requirement was instituted that the statute was not violated and as I read the opinion of the court below and the position of respondents, they rests on three separate grounds, that first of all that there was no demonstration of an intent to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.881" offset="744950">Secondly, there's a statutory argument and that is that such tests are privileged as “professionally developed ability tests” under Section 703 (h) of Title VII and then there is an assertion by the respondent which we say has no support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.787" offset="816525">In fact, the record in some parts of the country that the test survey legitimate business need that is that certain employees are not fully promotable throughout the plant to higher positions and that the high school education requirements help select employees who are.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.566" offset="891653">Now, before elaborating our argument, we would like to make our position clear with regard to ability testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.864" offset="924881">No employer, we submit under the statute is required to employ anyone who is unable to do the job and any employer may use tests and educational requirements which predict whether an employee or perspective employee can do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.127" offset="1001890">But if the tests that's used or the educational requirement that's used screens out members of a race or of a group protected by the statute and does not predict who can do the job or does not have predictive validity as the industrial psychologist use the terminus this record use the term, then it cannot be justified merely on the basis of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.688" offset="1104185">A good faith or intent, we submit is an elusive concept which regularly, frequently is advance in civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.071" offset="1145668">We hear good faith defenses in school segregation cases, in jury discrimination cases, in voting discrimination cases and the courts have regularly responded that they look to results and not make an effort to read the mind of an employer or indeed something much more difficult to do to read the mind of a corporation as to what it intends to do by the application of certain standards and tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.515" offset="1247441">Indeed, while it has not been possible on this record to challenge the good faith of the respondent because that's just something that one can very rarely develop evidence on.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.477" offset="1311284">Such a test would be an invitation to many who would seek to evade the statute to hide behind the concept of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.531" offset="1347542">Now as I said Duke Power Company adopted the test requirement for initial employment on July 2, 1965 the date of the Act in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.093" offset="1381815">Until then and until after the filing of the charge in this case in fact, employment of Duke Power Company was rigidly racially segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.132" offset="1425910">Black persons worked in the Labor Department only.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.944" offset="1441165">White persons worked in the better and higher paying jobs, that is the departments described in the record of Operations, Maintenance, Test and Laboratory, and Coal Handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.014" offset="1485469">And the highest paid black worker made less money than the lowest paid white worker under the system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="426.307" offset="1810641">Well, the intelligence test was put in at the request of certain non-high school graduate white workers in the Coal Handling Department as a substitute for a high school education and it has been described in the record as a test which would identify the average high school graduate.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.626" offset="1883888">So, it's perhaps even somewhat more stringent in the high school education requirement in that that half the high school graduates presumably would be unable to pass these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.328" offset="1918683">And to enable them to be promoted to the so-called inside departments, Labor and Coal Handling were outside only the departments or inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.727" offset="1952329">The high school education requirement was adopted considerably earlier and the date is not certain but it appears to be people talk in terms of about 1955 as a pre-requisite to employment and promotion in all departments but the Labor Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.336" offset="2014814">Black people can be employed in Labor without a high school education.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.419" offset="2027144">Others could be employed in the other departments initially only with a high school education.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.573" offset="2051699">But many pre-1955 Duke Power Employees are non-high school graduates at all pay levels throughout the plant and indeed, the -- our brief has an analysis of the pay which is earned by various workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.531" offset="2107496">The pay earned by an average high school work or an average non-high school worker is about the same the calculations are on page 38 of our brief and the Government's brief engages in a similar analysis of promotability comparable promotability and promotion rates of high school and non-high school graduates and it finds that high school and non-high school graduates within the plant are roughly promoted and approximately the same rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.705" offset="2364228">It just may be that in the power industry, it's possible to expand power production perhaps from other locations without increasing the work force but the employment situation has remained just about the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.924" offset="2425145">I think that doesn't seem to be any real doubt about that and they characterize it as stable, and it apparently is.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.510" offset="2463493">After the passage of the Act and they filed into complaint before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Duke did promote a number of black workers with a high school education over a period of a couple of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.215" offset="2506230">And the Court of Appeals then ordered the promotability but not the actual promotion of others employed before the high school education requirement was adopted and that is now in further litigation down in the District Court because there is a claim at which the Court has not yet rendered any position that some white people have been brought above this black workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.458" offset="2587209">The Court has not resolved that.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.109" offset="2597867">This case involves four workers frozen in the Labor Department by the test requirement of July 2, 1965 and by the fact that they have no high school education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.993" offset="5257341">Since adoption of the requirement, no employee white or black has been hired into departments other than the labor department unless he had a high school education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.886" offset="5304989">A collateral issue in this case in our view is whether or not the tests used by the company as a substitute for the high school requirement violates the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.135" offset="5357965">Petitioners assert that the educational requirement is discriminatory because it fails to meet the test of business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.206" offset="5390252">To meet that test, petitioners claim that any such requirement must be validated for job relatedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.138" offset="5417942">On the other hand, the company claims and the District Court below and the majority of the Court of Appeals below found and concluded that under the record, evidence in this case, the educational requirement had a genuine business purpose and was adopted to upgrade the quality of the defendant's workforce and was not adopted with any intent to discriminate against Negroes hired after adoption of the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.386" offset="5550958">The uncontradicted evidence of record in this case is that employees and the operations and maintenance department are responsible for the safe, efficient, and reliable operations and maintenance of complex machinery used in the production of electric and energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.106" offset="5621802">Those in the Laboratory Department must be able to perform laboratory conditions -- operations which include water analysis, coal analysis and keep accurate logs with respect to those operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.484" offset="5675405">Those in the Test Department must maintain the accuracy of instruments, gauges, and control devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.545" offset="5703617">Employees in Coal Handling must be able to read and understand manuals relating to complex machinery and operate that machinery in order to progress through the coal handling classification satisfactorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.001" offset="5773416">All of these jobs we submit to you require a degree of skill, judgment, and intelligence and we would respectfully say to you that it supports the company's decision to require in overall general intelligence and mechanical comprehension level as reasonably necessary to safely and efficiently operate a plant costing millions of dollars which performs a complex function of electric power production which this company as a public utility is required by law to maintain adequate and continuous service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.944" offset="9885194">I appear before you today in behalf of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States to urge affirmance of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.724" offset="9912362">This case is one which is a vital concern to employers, both small and large throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.736" offset="9940365">In today's labor market, there are often many applicants for the job, just as there are many employees who desire to be promoted into a better position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.922" offset="9973070">The employer must make a choice and the choice confine the employers often a difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.719" offset="9996267">We believe employers must be permitted to be able to use objective, generally accepted standards of intelligence, educational achievement or ability in order to make that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.628" offset="10039944">Mr. Cohen, let me put this question to you if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.728" offset="10052378">Assume area of the country where I suppose in the southwest there are people whose primary language is Spanish and have a rather limited comprehension of English.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.559" offset="10107653">Suppose an employer provided for farmworkers that they must pass the test, something like a literacy test in English on official that would be a rational request generally from employers I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.232" offset="10190305">Its impact in the southwest in that particular area for the farmworkers might have no relationship at all to the job, might or might not, wouldn't that bring it under the Act if the impact was there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="2532.590" offset="10235758">I think this is really the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.563" offset="10247670">Most educational test today unfortunately or aptitude test have a discriminatory impact on one and more racial groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.338" offset="10274732">This is the educ problem of the social economic status of these groups as it historically evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.806" offset="10300646">We would -- the position that petitioner's urge says that wherever you have an educational requirement, wherever you have an intelligence test, the employers then are obligated to prove business necessity that he had to use that particular tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.684" offset="10360205">We believe that where the employer has a legitimate business purpose and can demonstrate to the Court on the basis of the evidence in the case that he had a legitimate business purpose for the tests, he ought to be permitted to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.884" offset="10404927">When Congress enacted Title VII, it knew that educational requirements and tests had a potential discrimination on the type that you've just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.164" offset="10442125">It did not allow to use a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.598" offset="10447768">They did not prohibit the use of educational requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.681" offset="10460097">It tried to reach a compromise where employers could use such test and use such educational requirements as long as they were not a pretext or substitute for discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.247" offset="10574409">Our fear here really is that if a business necessity test is adopted of the type that petitioners varies to this Court, the result would be that employers won't be able to any objective test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.537" offset="10671585">This the way the Court of Appeals split on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.260" offset="10682452">In the majority opinion, the court says the respondent had a legitimate business purpose and persist the details some six or seven reasons why it believes that there had a legitimate business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.621" offset="10727905">It approached in a case by case basis and on the based of the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.460" offset="10743265">Judge Sobeloff in his dissent says the test is one of business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.438" offset="10759147">And that in turn is the position that petitioners urge before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.387" offset="10774925">The problem really is one of what does business necessity mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.443" offset="10791225">One Court of Appeals recently held that business necessity means that essential to the safe and efficient operation of the employers business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.749" offset="10820378">The trouble is that educational requirements or tests are never can be shown to be essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.173" offset="10838141">So the test is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.927" offset="10845142">The employer must fall back and use something other than objective criteria because under the EEOC's definition of a test, any objective means selecting employees is considered a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.176" offset="10886102">That's really what we're talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.133" offset="10893939">We're not talking about the Wonderlic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.310" offset="10898641">We're not talking about the Bennett test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.420" offset="10903134">We're talking about objective means of choosing which employee should fit in to a particular job or which employee should be hired in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.679" offset="10932182">And if the employers cannot use objective means, then the only way they can choose employers is either subjectively who does the interviewer like, or on the basis some arbitrary method like the first person in is the first person hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.206" offset="10982233">And we feel and that the Court noted in the Porter case that if you use subjective or arbitrary means, it have a vastly greater potential for discrimination and a vastly greater potential for poor business decisions and related business decision than a test in the objective kind of criteria which the Duke Power used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.497" offset="11063421">And our fear is that if the test --</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.548" offset="11939568">My principle reason here appearing is an amicus is not so much to argue the facts of whether the Court's decision was correct or whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.143" offset="11978021">That I think is the key issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.915" offset="12013129">Well, we think the correct test should be one as the Court of Appeals did of whether the employer and all the circumstances of the case and on a case by case approach adopted a -- had a legitimate business purpose for its testing requirement or for its educational requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.446" offset="14119225">Just a final word about 703 (h), we submit that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which is charge by the statute with the enforcement of the statute is in a particular peculiar -- peculiarly advantageous position to construe it and it has construed the term professionally developed ability test to mean a job validated test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.749" offset="14232388">So far as the legislative history is concerned, briefs are full of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.164" offset="14250047">We think that the conclusion of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission should be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.248" offset="14278363">We think that we have demonstrated quite clearly in the brief of legislative history indicates that one ought to be able to pass a test which indicates his ability to do a job not just to pass a test in the abstract which doesn't indicate anything at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.895" offset="14377002">In order to be a lineman, you had to be above a certain height and for variety of reasons, Mexican Americans in that part of the county were not above the certain height, generally speaking and they could not get the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.971" offset="14417335">Yet there was no indication that height had anything at all to do with the ability to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.662" offset="14436039">Proceeding was brought and the case was settled but it never came to a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.997" offset="14449413">But we would submit that if one could show that this was a height test and that only one-third as many black people qualified for the height test as white people and that height had nothing whatsoever to do with the ability to do the job, we've exactly this case here and that the result should be the same.</text>
