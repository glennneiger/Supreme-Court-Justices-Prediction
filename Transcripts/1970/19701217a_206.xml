            <text syncTime="33.173" offset="237046">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.863" offset="239867">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.587" offset="258779">The petitioner in this case was arrested on January 7 of 1966 and subsequently charged in a two-count indictment with two identical counts of sale of a narcotic drug to an undercover agent, the same undercover agent, two days apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.818" offset="347700">And these two offenses occurred allegedly the day before and three days before the date of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.681" offset="375077">After his arrest and the time factor in not found in the record, he was removed to the Office of the District Attorney of Westchester County at our courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.810" offset="415619">And there, in the presence of a number of law enforcement officers, detectives, assistant district attorneys and so forth, and a stenographer, a written statement was taken from him which does appear in its entirety in the record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.690" offset="483119">However, that statement itself discloses that it followed a period of questioning, the length of which is never disclosed by the same district attorney, same law enforcement officers and there is no place in this record where the facts of the prior questioning are elicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.391" offset="593983">It so happen that this case was tried before one of our most beloved and respected judges and when the statement came up, he, realizing precisely the point that was at issue, the difference between the Miranda view of impeachment that I take and the New York Court of Appeals’ view in the Kulis case asked the prosecutor who tried the case, who was the same prosecutor who took the statement, “Mr. Facelle, did you give this man any warning other than appears in this statement?”</text>
            <text syncTime="157.695" offset="735148">And the prosecutor said, he had not.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="160.240" offset="745388">Who was the trial judge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_martin_aurnou" startTime="162.144" stopTime="240.567">
            <label>Mr. Joel Martin Aurnou</label>
            <text syncTime="162.144" offset="753016">Judge Robert E. Dempsey, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.380" offset="773914">Now, what that meant was that couple with the statement itself which shows you in repeated places the prosecutor says to him, “All I want you to do is tell us what you already told us before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="182.386" offset="833891">And Mr. Harris, well, he was 23 years old. He did have a 10th Grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.822" offset="855730">Such as it was, he was an addict and he was suffering from withdrawal syndromes.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.823" offset="879658">And Mr. Harris said in the face of the fact that he had been questioned without warnings and he was now being questioned by a reporter, he said “I’d like to see a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.985" offset="916334">He said, “I don’t think I should keep on before I see a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="206.453" offset="930231">And at that point, Mr. Facelle told him that he had an absolute right to a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.504" offset="950397">He said, “I’ll have him taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.507" offset="958443">He can get a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="216.134" offset="968892">But the petitioner was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.031" offset="988536">He had no prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.887" offset="999926">He had minimal involvement with the law in my view and I don’t think for a moment that he understood either that he had a right to cancel then and there or that he had a right to free counsel then and there, and his answer is --</text>

            <text syncTime="240.567" offset="1066695">And of course as of that time he didn’t have either of those rights under the United States of Constitution, did he?</text>

            <text syncTime="247.933" offset="1096161">At that date, Your Honor, Miranda had not come down and the standard had not been explicitly decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.191" offset="1125209">On the other hand, it is my view and I commend to you that Escobedo was in existence at that time.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="262.563" stopTime="263.969">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="262.563" offset="1154675">Well, that’s a fact and it’s not a matter of opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_martin_aurnou" startTime="263.969" stopTime="406.367">
            <label>Mr. Joel Martin Aurnou</label>
            <text syncTime="263.969" offset="1160317">But the opinion which I believe Your Honor wrote said that confession obtained under such circumstances could not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.266" offset="1209428">That was the word you used and I prefer to admissibility because “used” and “admissibility” have some distinctions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.401" offset="1242028">But what I am saying is this, when he asked for a lawyer, it was not only a question of rights were available to him because he didn’t appreciate what they were at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.764" offset="1291452">But the prosecutor did lo and behold ,when you get to the end of this statement, the prosecutor says to him, “By the way, when you kept on going after you asked for a lawyer, you meant to waive a lawyer, didn’t you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="307.868" offset="1335860">And Viven Harris said, “Huh?”</text>
            <text syncTime="310.820" offset="1347668">He didn’t understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.174" offset="1357072">And the young lady from New York County makes a point in her brief that they explained it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.477" offset="1378283">Well, they told him what the word waiver meant but they didn’t tell him a thing about the consequences of it, not three-word explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.749" offset="1407436">So Mr. Harris found himself in what I believe to be the situation of the type of defendant that you have been most alert to protect, one who is in no position to comprehend or to appreciate what right it is he said to have waived because he doesn’t understand the nature of it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.449" offset="1494162">Now, when you come to the question of fairness to law enforcement officers, it is suggested that well, as Mr. Justice Stewart raised, maybe that wasn’t the law at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.518" offset="1546512">I think that law was reasonably inferable from what this Court had been doing and I think the prosecutor did infer or he wouldn’t have asked him about the waiver which is the traditional way of trying to get around Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.844" offset="1595726">But something more important happened and that was the decision of this Court in Johnson, because on the day that Mr. Harris came to trial, there wasn’t any question about what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.013" offset="1644419">His legal aid attorney try one of his first cases, knew exactly what the law was and made the proper objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.490" offset="1674407">The judge and perhaps it’s the reason we respect him so highly, pointed out to the prosecuting attorneys that if you do this, it will have to be decided in an appellate court.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.396" offset="1754028">Is there any claim, anywhere along the line of the contents in the statement are untrue?</text>

            <text syncTime="421.209" offset="1789241">I have to explain that in terms of the respective positions, Judge Blackmun that each of the parties herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.749" offset="1815364">Miss Landau in the New York County brief makes the unequivocal statement that as to one date it’s true and as to one date it is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.287" offset="1845561">Mr. Duggan makes the statement in the Westchester County brief that the jury must have believed him or they would have convicted on both counts rather than solely on the second count.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.307" offset="1921630">Yes, I would like to explain my view on that and perhaps your question makes this the appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.762" offset="1955485">I think that what happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.309" offset="1965620">The statement have vast difference intrinsically as to the two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.120" offset="1988921">On the first count, the statement indicated that Viven Harris had acted solely as the agent of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.876" offset="2027896">That is the agent desire to make the buy, the agent paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.978" offset="2044301">Viven Harris derived nothing from the act of being a conduit.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.991" offset="2068334">And in fact, Judge Dempsey expressly charged the jury that if they found him to be an agent, they must acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.357" offset="2109816">I think that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.223" offset="2117339">On the second count however, it was unbelievably damming in this sense, petitioner’s testimony at the trial was, that he had in fact through a scheme and deception provided two bags of a substitute for heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.424" offset="2194139">There’s no heroin in these bags at all which he gave.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.549" offset="2210544">I believe that’s correct Judge, by the point was it had just enough for of a kick to deceive anybody who was a snorter which was their impression of what detective Bermudas was masquerading (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="538.042" offset="2256520">However, the statement contained the suggestion that not only that did he get monetary payment for it, but he got a taste of heroin from those two bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.868" offset="2307824">It meant that the entire statement would be meaningless unless in fact there was heroin in those two little bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.232" offset="2345336">Now, Mr. Duggan has suggested that it wasn’t so significant as to the second count because how could he refuse the heroin that was offered to him without giving away the game that they were playing.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.772" offset="2399462">The answer is that you cannot find in this record that it was ever offered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.287" offset="2425584">What you find is that he took it in payment but you do not find any testimony that Bermudez, the detective, offered this to him voluntarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.475" offset="3302254">And as I think my brief had shown you every Federal Circuit Court in the country that has considered this and there are six of them has reached the view which I respectfully espouse today.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.165" offset="3461078">I say that when you foreclose a defendant from proving involuntariness, it is ill to lie in your mouth to say that the confession was voluntary as the briefs continually urged for that was the very thing that we raised and we prevent it from questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.249" offset="3533385">And I would say to you that this was no light question that we raised because the statement itself intrinsically bore evidence of a very clever prior questioning which may well have been delivered, I have no way of knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.461" offset="3594198">But the warnings were not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.459" offset="3602244">Thanks to Judge Dempsey’s elicitation of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.445" offset="3618126">And what happened was, we had a secret inquisition, something in the nature of a subtle star chamber proceeding and then we proceed to a recorded statement for posterity which is the one we’re not afraid to show to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.007" offset="3672461">I think that’s wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.610" offset="3678835">I think it’s very much like the cases were you have probable cause and, search and seizure and then police come in and testify that all of the sudden defendants are dropping things on the side work in front of them, which they then pick up.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.848" offset="3731811">It’s too convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.282" offset="3737558">And I say one of the District Attorney, not just an average police officer, but an educated man and an experienced lawyer, deliberately interrogates privately and then publicly, that circumstance is suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.990" offset="3804327">Now when it came to the trial, I think it’s conceded that all of the proper objections were made, certainly the New York courts treated them that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.479" offset="3842361">And when it came to verdict, the jury was unable to agree as to the first count which was an identical sale and I subsequently had that dismissed during the appellate process for lack of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.846" offset="3891785">As to the second count, which I believe the distinction is explained by the affected statement itself, he was convicted and sentenced to six to eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.098" offset="3932745">He served that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.696" offset="3939224">He’s out on parole and so at the present time, he is technically in custody but in fact, I supposed he phrased, would be alive and well in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.195" offset="3989170">I would like to discuss first the -- taking first this statement and the matter of which it was obtained, I think it was clearly illegally obtained and I point out respectfully that that was conceded all the way to the New York courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.226" offset="4045281">It was treated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.718" offset="4051237">It was not conceded to be involuntary in the classic sense but by a foreclosure from it, by the trial judge’s reading of Kulis as allowing this in an involuntary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.897" offset="4095958">I think that is the posture in which this case comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.499" offset="4118424">Now I say that when a thing is unconstitutionally obtained, it is inadmissible for any purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.004" offset="5196445">But he doesn’t know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.467" offset="5206267">And he’s afraid to tell the police what happened, he thinks he better talk to his lawyer first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.835" offset="5227687">So he makes up a false exculpatory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.554" offset="5242629">He can be torn to shreds at the trial by in inexperienced prosecutor and that’s just what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.128" offset="5268856">But it doesn’t prove that the statement that he makes in his testimony at the trial is false because it may well be at the statement unconstitutionally obtained was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.254" offset="5325385">When you forbid a hearing on the issue of voluntariness, how can you then come with good grades and say he willingly gave his true statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.785" offset="5363524">I think that in the unique factual setting of this case, the difficulty on the merits that is the substantive view that I take was compounded by the procedural refusal to ever have a hearing which could have determined once and for all the voluntariness or involuntariness of his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.656" offset="5455057">And I emphasize again that one of the most serious things in this case is that the question of voluntariness was not lightly or haphazardly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.617" offset="5490897">It had its germination in the statement itself which showed what had happened and in Judge Dempsey’s question to Mr. Facelle about those warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.380" offset="5529872">Now, I have referred to the various cases in the Circuit Courts discussing the view that this court took in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.560" offset="5562681">I don’t wish to belabor them but I will point out that in neither brief is there one word distinguishing any of those six cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.560" offset="5602597">Of those six cases, five dealt directly with impeachment and the sixth was a case of impeachment by rebuttal rather than by cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.919" offset="5652020">There are a number of state cases which support the same view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.649" offset="5666962">But the argument I make basically is in the words of former Chief Justice White in Burgett against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.895" offset="5699981">I think this case is a rule which erodes the procedural rights of the defendants and assumes avalanche proportion, just burying beneath it the integrity of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.236" offset="5749300">You can completely destroy the ability to tell which statement was true and what happened on the merits and I go back to Krulewitch and Mr. Justice Jackson, where he says, “The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.408" offset="5838012">Well I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.274" offset="5841460">I think that was what Brewton stood for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.358" offset="5853790">And I think in this case, it would be equally naive to assume that jury could put that second aspect of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.879" offset="5883883">That is the confession that is related to the second count out of their minds as a substantive thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.446" offset="5906139">As my brief indicates, I don’t think Judge Dempsey did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.161" offset="5921081">I think that when he charged them, agency on the first count, he was taking the substantive material from the concession itself, the statement itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.887" offset="6891896">Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.027" offset="6904539">I think I can perhaps be of more service to the Court by beginning rather than what a formal argument by answering some of the questions that the Justices have had asked and perhaps haven’t been answered to my full satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.425" offset="6970055">When Miranda was decided in June of 1966, the prosecutor went over his own statement and he evaluated in terms of the law by which he was obliged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.345" offset="7025748">And we said to one another forget the statement in the Harris case because we didn’t give him that forth warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.000" offset="7052392">So as a consequence, when the time came went in another case, we would observe notice on the defendant that we intended to use a statement as evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.995" offset="7104428">We chose at that time not to serve any such notice because it was not then our intention to use the statement against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.033" offset="7140477">So as a consequence that was never any -- what in New York State has become a Huntley hearing on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.184" offset="7177153">But throughout the entire progress of this trial, everyone knew and everyone accepted that this was a completely voluntary statement in a traditional sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.939" offset="7236190">Its only false was that by reason of Miranda, it was no longer admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.251" offset="7265447">And so as a consequence, when at the time of this statement was sought to be introduced for impeachment purposes, and when I say introduce, they don’t mean introduce into evidence because it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.364" offset="7305885">At the time it was resorted to for impeachment purposes and there was an objection raised, there was no hearing then being sought on a traditional concept of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.614" offset="7366802">The thought that was being explored by holding such a hearing at that time was whether or nor it was admissible and the trial judge said certainly, everybody knows that this statement is not admissible into evidence because the people opened and closed their case without ever having any resort to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.012" offset="7456455">But he said in terms of People against Kulis, which is the law in the State of New York, the inadmissibility of the statement has nothing to do with whether or not it may be used for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.758" offset="7511416">And he said, “Therefore gentlemen, I am not going to have any hearing to find out something that all of us already know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.663" offset="7539001">It’s inadmissible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.714" offset="7551227">But granted the point and as I say it was grated by all concerned, that is was a voluntary statement, it then certainly became the same thing that everybody had agreed and the traditional sense was perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.876" offset="7623952">Because there was a time that common law, when the defendant was under no circumstance allowed to testify on his own defense, and this was thought to be basically so because the defendant had so much to lose by a successful prosecution and he had so much to gain by a successful forwarding of that prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.787" offset="7715589">But he was essentially, by definition unbelievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.361" offset="7733875">Or so far as I know, the first break in that common law tradition came in New York State in 1869, in that state for the first time, our defendant was allowed to take a stand and it was there that the concept grew up, that no presumption should be drawn against him if he doesn’t.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.220" offset="7849232">And the New York Court of Appeals, the following year was called upon to decide the case under the New York law, under this New York statute and they deliberately painted a defendant as a double entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.808" offset="7911612">In one capacity, he is a defendant on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.899" offset="7923942">And in that capacity, he has under most circumstances to be compelled to get on that stand and get evidence of anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.310" offset="9521591">Now, if we go beyond this area, In Oklahoma, old back in -- about 1898 up to that point, the great many jurisdictions as I’ve said went along with the proposition that even in inadmissible statement would be proper impeachment -- for a proper impeachment purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.915" offset="9612079">But the Eighth Circuit in Oklahoma at that time, I got this citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.886" offset="9627961">Harold against Oklahoma said, “No, we got to come to a point of division here, and that point of division has to be whether or not this statement was voluntary, because an involuntary statement carries with it the stigma of untruth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.661" offset="9691073">And at that point that the division came and then from thereon a great many jurisdictions, all whom I’ve listed, continued to cleave to that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.598" offset="9742796">A statement even though inadmissible was the proper source of cross-examination for impeachment if it was demonstrated to be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.355" offset="9785846">And that condition existed right up until 1966 when this Court decided Miranda against Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.845" offset="9815730">And at that point, the Court indicated that even in an inculpatory statement, if it sought to be used by the prosecution becomes just for the very purpose that he chooses to offer it to a certain extent inculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.290" offset="9881558">And the Court said that even in an exculpatory statement, the Miranda warnings would have to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.457" offset="9910188">And a great many courts from the language of the court in that Miranda case came to the conclusion that even for impeachment purposes, simple voluntariness wasn’t enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.727" offset="9967344">And that was the source of what we think is the misunderstanding that has been created by the diversion among this courts because as Mr. Aurnou points out, he’s got 16 jurisdictions on his side and as I point out, I got eight jurisdictions on mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.531" offset="10050518">Now that’s the way you win baseball games.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.152" offset="10060967">It isn’t the way you win important determinations of law because any of my eight could be as right as any of his 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.847" offset="10103808">The point that we would make is this, in Miranda against Arizona, the Court directed itself to the admissibility of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.788" offset="10147589">It started in the first paragraph and I can’t quite quote the language, we address ourselves to be admissibility of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.447" offset="10186146">But the important thing to remember is that in the ordinary effective sense, this confession of confession can be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.452" offset="10218224">It was not introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.482" offset="10230345">And so as a consequence, it can reasonably be concluded I think that Miranda did not addressed itself to confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.127" offset="10260856">The purpose of which was to -- was to not introduce into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.559" offset="10282590">Now the point that is important is if you got an exculpatory statement that was taken with the full Miranda warnings, you can introduce that into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.782" offset="10339537">Now suppose he gave another exculpatory statement with the full Miranda warnings to another law enforcement officer that would be equally admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.052" offset="10392618">And thus perhaps, you might be able to impeach his credibility or his reliability or what have you before he ever got on the stand by the purpose of introducing two inconsistent statements that were taken under the authority and with the full approval of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.920" offset="10476105">And we suggest to this Court that this is the thing that the Court sought to prevent, the introduction into evidence on the people’s direct case of these inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.329" offset="10545695">And I see my time is up, I think I said all I have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.007" offset="10556458">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.670" offset="10679024">There was a hearing held after the impeachment in the judges’ chambers at which the judge did give Mr. Facelle, the prosecutor, an opportunity to show that perhaps Miranda was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.175" offset="10729075">He tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.341" offset="10737748">But that was the only objection that there was or could have been to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.801" offset="10767632">This voluntary statement that was given prior to Miranda was used to discredit trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.882" offset="10795948">It was not used to establish Viven Harris’ guilt of the substantive crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.002" offset="10824370">But when the petitioner, in this case, took the witness stand and affirmatively resorted to perjury, the jury was entitled to know that its trial testimony was not the only version of the events that he had ever given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.167" offset="10893019">The exclusionary rule should not be extended to bar this limited use of a voluntary statement that was lawfully obtained because the New York rule which allows this impeaching use of the statement, safeguards very vital aspect of the jury’s role as a fact-finding body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.274" offset="10977447">And that aspect is not the one that is endangered by the ordinary exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.108" offset="11008794">Indeed, there is no need even to consider extending the exclusionary rule to this case because this use of petitioner’s statement did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.891" offset="11063965">He was not by being impeached compelled to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.294" offset="11085594">The statement was voluntary and it was never introduced for the truth of its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.041" offset="11116523">In allowing this impeachment moreover, the trial court was not and this Court will not be condoning any police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.891" offset="11155916">There was no police misconduct or prosecutorial misconduct involved in the questioning of Viven Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.378" offset="11325921">He said, he couldn’t do it, quite simply because there was a panic on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.537" offset="11834577">What the prosecution did this statement was to say, “You heard my witnesses, you heard Viven Harris, who here is telling the truth?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.243" offset="11885359">And then he argued the if the petitioner was abusing the jury’s intelligence by trying to tell them that all these sort of facts was true, that he couldn’t remember what happened 24 hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.372" offset="11933842">That’s the sole extent of the impeachment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.392" offset="11949934">Now, the instruction, not simply the instruction in this case but in instruction in any similar case to the jury that this statement can be used only as it -- in their assessment of the defendant’s credibility is a very readily understood instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.526" offset="12406450">This goes to the weight, the believability of the witnesses’ testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.803" offset="12419615">And we know in this case that the jury did in fact follow that instruction because they found him, they did not convict him on the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.958" offset="12456187">The statement as the first count was a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.760" offset="12467472">It was minimizing his role, that’s very true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.874" offset="12479906">But it was a confession and it was also inconformity to the people’s proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.466" offset="12578231">Now he just told about going some place and the DA say said, “Some place you went to the same place?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.289" offset="12601532">Harris said, “Yes, no, no, no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.776" offset="12663495">Yes, it was true that on January 6, 1966, Viven Harris gave two glassine envelopes in exchange for $12.00 to Detective George Bermudez but it never happened in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.219" offset="12717307">He never got it from some man standing outside the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.587" offset="12730786">He went over to him in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.974" offset="12736324">He said to him, “Do you want anything today?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.714" offset="12767253">This is the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.719" offset="12779269">He goes outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.407" offset="12781986">He goes back home for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.562" offset="12786688">He’s gone 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.636" offset="12790972">He comes back in to the bar and he said, “Hey, Joe” because that’s the name Bermudez is using, “Will you step outside with me for a minute?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.556" offset="12822632">They go outside, they’re seen outside, the partner of the detective sees them outside, sees them in the automobiles, sees that double exchange of hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.394" offset="12857950">We’ve all become so familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.792" offset="12871534">That second statement was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.430" offset="12882087">But that’s irrelevant because it’s not introduced for the truth of this content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.169" offset="12901104">Its value lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.511" offset="12910404">In the fact the defendant was willing to tell different stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.934" offset="12924092">This is also the answer to the coerced confession, not only wasn’t the statement coerced and there’s has never been a claim of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.344" offset="12949797">But under the law in New York, you may not use a coerced confession as a prior and consistent statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.082" offset="12976755">It cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.199" offset="12981144">It can be inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.106" offset="12992846">But to be a prior inconsistent statement by definition that defendant must have been willing to make the earlier statement and a statement that’s been coerced is not the one that defendant is being willing to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.288" offset="13041539">So the statement is excluding not because it’s unreliable, that’s irrelevant in a way because it does not offer for its truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.163" offset="13069019">It’s excluded before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.233" offset="13077379">It is coerced and therefore has no probative value on issue of this credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.167" offset="13105068">It was said by the petitioner here that defendants will now be discouraged from taking the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.915" offset="13140072">The rule in this case, the rule adopted by the new Court of Appeals will now and has not and could not discourage defendants from the taking the witness stand because this statement to the extent that the hypothesis is made that a person has a reasonable explanation for why he made an inconsistent statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.705" offset="13239233">Many times people do tell a lies to the police but have reasonable explanations whether it was fear or bewilderment, nobody has a reasonable explanation for an inconsistent statement which is compatible with the truth of this trial testimony or hesitate to take the stand and give that explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.610" offset="13318855">And even beyond this, we know from experience that defendants where confessions are actually introduced as evidence of guilt have never hesitated to take the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.582" offset="13366711">It is not the existence and evidence or proof of guilt out of its own mouth which keeps the defendant off the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.432" offset="13398162">And there is no reason to believe that the availability not as proof of guilt but simply if the man, affirmatively resorts to perjury that the availability of this statement to impeach him to expose to the jury that this may not be the truth will deter any defendant from taking the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.453" offset="13482172">Now this situation in this case is different than the situation in Brewton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.051" offset="13508608">In Brewton, the statement is introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.814" offset="13515609">The co-defendant statement is introduced not only as the truth of its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.497" offset="13530342">It’s used as the direct evidence of guilt against the co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.231" offset="13549359">It’s this which the jury has difficulty in following, that is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.721" offset="13587289">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.601" offset="13618845">I would like to way first Your Honor that somehow in the argument and perhaps it’s because my brother, Mr. Duggan was a little too enthusiastic, we lost sight of the material which appears in the appendix at the footer page 69 and at the top of page 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.050" offset="13684569">At that point, defense counsel says, “Your Honor, I take strong objection to the procedure herein.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.071" offset="13704631">This was presented to the jury before any examination so that the legal voluntariness of this statement, ands the judge says, “Let the record reflect for you that you are taking an exception to the fact that under the Huntley case which is voluntariness, it was not authored on the basis of notice required under the code criminal procedure and you also have an exception under the fact that it violates Miranda against Arizona.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.363" offset="13813823">So, I say to you that I think the record bears out my statement to Mr. Justice Stewart in response to his question that we fairly sought the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.899" offset="13856037">There was no hearing in chambers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.058" offset="13864605">What there was, was a discussion during which Judge Dempsey asked, “Mr. Facelle, did you give this man any warning?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.481" offset="13894280">Other than what’s in that statement and the answer was “no.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.724" offset="13963243">Judge Dempsey again, I can’t express my admiration for him enough, marked it solely as an exhibit to have it exactly before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.087" offset="13992709">But the fact is that it was read visibly by the prosecutor in its entirety.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.899" offset="14072017">But the thing that was significant was he got the entire thing in there and in part of the question, he says to them, “When, you told me that was a true.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.665" offset="14107021">True, that was the word that Mr. Facelle used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.862" offset="14119873">And maybe the jury lost the significance of the difference, but while on the one hand, Ms. Landau says they know what was going on, on page 15 of her brief, she says they must have been confused or they wouldn’t have acquitted him on the first count.</text>
