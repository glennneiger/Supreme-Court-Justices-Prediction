            <text syncTime="489.497" offset="2061354">If we cannot get injunction and removal then we think we have very properly asked this Court for damages and we think that we asked for damages for two purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.478" offset="2589236">Now, some of them exceeded this by so much that it is dirt line, fearsome and dangerous because some of the more 8 parts per million of mercury -- methyl mercury in the flesh of these fish and some of them in Lake St. Clair where as much as 10 parts per million.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.313" offset="7452609">I think there one has certain considerations of federalism which are quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.037" offset="7475493">There's been some discussion this morning about the capacity of this Court is distinct from an Ohio court to determine Ohio law and that certainly is a relevant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.285" offset="7524498">Now, I may say that I think there may be -- that may turn out to be somewhat more dispute about the actual jurisdiction of this Court than does appear from the papers in their present state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.653" offset="7569951">And in particular with respect to the jurisdiction over Dow Chemical of Canada and that’s the principal matter I intend to talk about this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.458" offset="7609240">It is agreed that the questions of personal jurisdiction and service of process are not yet raised similarly any questions about indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.878" offset="7650931">And issues of that sort would have to await decision of a later time and it does seem to be general agreement that injunctive relief at least would be within the court’s power to order, although there are some dispute again with regard to the Canadian defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.552" offset="7717595">So I don’t feel I have to spend much time on the Wyandotte Corporation’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.249" offset="7740374">They addressed themselves only to the Federal Water Quality statutes and in this respect I simply want to restate what’s said out in much greater length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.268" offset="7784469">What are certainly from Ohio’s point of view and I think in terms of the relief it’s asked from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.339" offset="7808711">Realistically, deficiencies in those remedies which the Court ought to -- ought very much to bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.630" offset="7849880">In particular, the remedy is prospective only, it operates only as a means of stopping future pollution and it’s heavily laden with the administrative delay besides, except for oil which is dealt with in a separate provision 33 U.S.C. Section 1161.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.857" offset="7930755">The Act imposes no obligation on someone who has polluted in the past to remove the polluting substances which he has introduced into the waters or to bear responsibility for the damages which those substances of course but leaves those matters to the courts or to other agencies to a suit such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.855" offset="8022810">An injunctive remedy for nuisance is common in this Court’s original jurisdiction as its already been pointed out and that it’s also clear that this Court could order removal of a nuisance which would not abate of its own force as this mercury is alleged to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.597" offset="8085713">The Court did such a thing in Pennsylvania versus the Wheeling Bridge Company in 13 How. of its reports and we think it easily follows also from the Wyandotte Transportation Company decision of a few terms ago that removal might be accomplished by the provision of the funds such as Ohio seeks and towards the defendant could pay moneys to be use for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.107" offset="8187800">I may say, we do have some difficulty with the claim of Ohio for compensatory damages, but it doesn’t seem to us that that claim is necessarily excluded from this Court’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.030" offset="8255509">In the past, the Court has rejected such claims as Mr. Brown points out because it was clear that they were intended for the benefit of particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.951" offset="8291140">In North Dakota versus Minnesota and particular the State segregated its claim that was $5,000.00 for us and a million dollars for the farmers who were paying the expenses of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.681" offset="8338056">There is no such differentiation here and we really don’t know how Ohio intends to use the money at which it receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.341" offset="8372746">It may be remarked in the first place that Ohio has undoubted proprietary interest here and we can't say as could be said in North Dakota case what proportion that proprietary interest bears to the damages that might be assessed nor is it excluded I think that in assessment of damages could be used in a way that bears very strongly on the nuisance remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.782" offset="8478490">Now the defendants makes a great deal in their brief of the difficulty of calculating the sums that would be required to remove the mercury from the lake bed and of the enormity of that financial burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.572" offset="8525615">I would suggest and it has been suggested by some commentators that an appropriate way of calculating monetary relief in such circumstances and perhaps the simpler one is to assess the damages which have been done and then to use those funds for that removal purpose and certainly it doesn’t seem to me excluded on the complaint that that’s what Ohio would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.444" offset="8617148">Certainly, it ought not to be the case but because the one level of funds is so hard to compute in so amount -- and so amends in amount that the polluter should simply go away scot-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.433" offset="8681096">And finally, I would point out in this regard that if Ohio were using the funds in this particular way as a means of remedying the nuisance it couldn’t be claimed as the defendants do that there were some risk of double recovery because although the measure might be the same as could be obtained in the suit brought by an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.330" offset="8752671">The use and the remedy would be entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.523" offset="8765419">I come now to the principal area of controversy of importance to the United States and that is the possible liability of Dow Chemical of Canada or of its parent Dow Chemical Company for acts done at the company’s Canadian factory whose effects are felt in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.227" offset="8836263">Now these two companies appear quite strongly to insist that any assertion of jurisdiction by this Court might provoke in international incident or undercut in international treaty and we want to make it claim that it’s the view of the United States that no such consequences would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.499" offset="8909406">The power of American courts to redress torts whose effects are felt on American soil is we believe indisputable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.713" offset="8946186">The company has also raised certain doubts regarding whether the Court could provide an effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.016" offset="8967398">This goes essentially to matters of discretion but we do point out certain respects in which more facts are needed before a final conclusion can be reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.448" offset="9005119">Let me begin with the issue of liability, I think all of us would agree on a simple case in which issues of causation are not obscure in case of the individual who is standing on one side of Niagara River fires a rifle across it and it kills the person on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.570" offset="9085680">The person -- if the State in which the individual was murdered is able to secure jurisdiction over the person of the sniper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.470" offset="9117236">And that of course is not a question that’s here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.127" offset="9127894">There could be no dispute of its power to try him for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.552" offset="9141582">International law recognizes that right and I don’t think the party seriously contests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.530" offset="9161540">The situation is the same if instead of sending a rifle bullet he sends sludge which causes a public nuisance on the other side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.904" offset="9206993">Again, to the extent that a public nuisance may be prosecuted as a crime -- there could be no dispute that the recipient state may prosecute the individual if it may obtain service on him before that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.516" offset="9281390">A Canadian court would feel as competent as an American court in those circumstances and the only way an international incident could arise would be if some improper means have been used to secure jurisdiction of the defendant or a due process where somehow denied in the course of the trial and both of which we are quite certain will not happen in this proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.809" offset="9370624">There might be some question whether a judicial decree obtained in civil proceedings would be enforceable in the courts of the other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.234" offset="9408345">And that is -- we don’t -- we think it should be quite clear to this Court that if it ultimately does grant relief a judgment to Ohio then judgment will then be Ohio is to enforce as part of the same situation and Ohio may indeed have some difficulty in enforcing that judgment in Canadian court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="2370.346" offset="9584724">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.945" offset="9599143">The suggestion is made that the fact that this is a public nuisance suit here makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.358" offset="9624848">I think the argument is essentially that only the United States could bring an action for public nuisance against a person who is resident in a foreign country and producing his nuisance from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.899" offset="9682944">As if only the United States could prosecute the sniper on the banks of the Niagara River or a murder which he causes in New York State, I think to state the proposition in that way is to answer under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.758" offset="9742399">The States are forbidden from engaging in diplomacy but Ohio doesn’t seek to involve the Canadian Government in any respect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.559" offset="9777612">It charges an offense to its domestic laws felt on its own soil against the particular individual who may or may not be within its power to bring to justice and if the individual is within its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.212" offset="9828185">It is only because it is available to domestic service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.223" offset="9844276">Canada need never be consulted in its territory is never entered upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.550" offset="9865592">Ohio obtains the judgment and seeks to have it enforced as I said before if it must take it to Canada, Canadian courts will then decide what recognition to give the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.999" offset="9907388">That will be a Canadian domestic matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.319" offset="9928600">There are of course alternative ways of dealing with the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.735" offset="9946363">Ohio might have come to the United States and requested the United States to take this matter up with the Canadian Government as a diplomatic matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.757" offset="9982412">That was done in the case prominently mentioned in the briefs the Trail Smelter case in British Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.577" offset="10013654">But this is merely an alternative on a required motive proceeding and as we said out at length in our brief, the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 provides no mechanism for the mandatory resolution of pollution disputes concerning boundary waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.712" offset="10078229">In this connection, I think I ought to correct a misapprehension which Dow Chemical of United States at least have with regard to the Boundary Waters Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.622" offset="10117831">They twice mentioned Article II of the treaty as if it had some bearing on this case may be found at page 3-a and 4-a of the brief of Dow Chemical of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.472" offset="10173210">That Article applies, well I think and perhaps the quickest way to do this is to suggest the three different sorts of -- three different situations that one may have across the Canadian-American boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.045" offset="10227545">And we have a river that runs across the boundary and may be interfered with upstream or downstream and then one may have waters like Lake Erie which sit on the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.032" offset="10275506">Only waters on the boundary are designated boundary waters under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.156" offset="10295986">Article II provides as to a river which runs across the boundary that if someone on the upstream ended it interferes with its use and that might conceivably include pollution although it has never been so adjudicated, then and in that circumstance only a downstream individual may come into the courts of the Upstream nation and litigate in that forum the issue of the damages which is done to him and is entitled to have that litigation resolve in his favor under the laws of that nation as if he were a citizen thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.911" offset="10455019">Now, that is a specific remedy and if that were applicable in this case, Ohio would be able to go into the courts of Canada and get relief against Dow Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.676" offset="10494098">It’s not applicable here because we’re dealing with boundary waters not a river which crosses the boundary and the result is that Ohio hasn’t much less certain remedy, I would say than it would have if Article II applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.208" offset="10552195">Nonetheless, the failure of the treaty to deal with that situation in the view of the United States does not at all exclude the possibility of the remedy which Ohio is seeking today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.376" offset="10600887">The remedy which Ohio is seeking is recognized an international law and there is nothing in the treaty which excludes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.790" offset="10630562">It seems to us that the principle stated by this Court in New Jersey versus New York City is equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.896" offset="10658983">If the defendant is before the Court and I'm reading from page 482 of volume 283 of the Court’s opinion that the defendant is before the Court in the property of plaintiff and its citizens that is alleged to have been injured by such dumping is within the court’s territorial jurisdiction the situs of the Act creating the nuisance whether within or without the United States is of no importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.981" offset="10755323">And turn very briefly to the problems of enforcement at which chiefly is I think this Court has already recognized should await later resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.848" offset="10798791">The first observation is that to the extent money damages are possible there is really no issue about enforcement nor is there any possible disability regarding this Court’s power to give injunctive relief so far as that injunctive relief applies on this side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.708" offset="10870157">If the Court has jurisdiction over Dow Canada’s person it may enjoin Dow Canada requiring it to remove the mercury from the American half of the St. Clair River or of the Detroit River or of Lake Erie and there should be no question to this Court’s power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.986" offset="10935359">There are I think some problems involved with granting injunctive relief which would necessarily take effect in Canada or to put -- excuse me, to put it in other way which would require that aid of a Canadian court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.369" offset="10988857">I think, if the Court wherever to conclude that that were necessary it could fairly apprehend that the aid of a Canadian court might not be forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.248" offset="11028355">But as we understand its complaint, Ohio asked only that Dow be enjoined from producing the objective to effects on the American side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.345" offset="11068792">And the cases are legion which state that such an injunction is proper for an American court to enter the Salton Sea cases, the United States versus -- excuse Steele versus Bulova Watch Company, Vanity Fair Mills versus Eaton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.817" offset="11142666">All of these cases quite clearly comprehend that where an effect is felt within the United States, the United States court having jurisdiction of the parties has the authority to enter an injunction requiring that that effect be seized and as we understand that is all that Ohio seeks in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.642" offset="11241932">The point is that it begs the question to state as Dow does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.360" offset="11260844">The Dow Chemical of Canada’s conduct has been wholly fund and that therefore this Court lacks jurisdiction to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.087" offset="11291669">On the allegations of the complaint, it must be assumed that the tortious conduct is extended to this country and if that’s the case there is no principle of international law that bars this Court from entertaining Ohio seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.218" offset="11340257">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.057" offset="11387591">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.669" offset="11410056">On behalf of the defendant Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, we have raised no question of jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.952" offset="11451225">It is our position that it is a discretionary matter within the Court sound discretion and therefore we have urged certain prudential considerations to suggest to the Court how its discretion should be exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.494" offset="11541400">There are not only considerable legal precedents but there are practical precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.304" offset="11576613">The questions have indicated the legal precedents are not as well-established as Mr. Brown would have the Court believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.672" offset="11634082">The cases of which he speaks I believe were cases that either fell within the round of cases of exclusive jurisdiction or they were cases where there were no mechanics setup by the statutes for administrative agencies to afford relief and therefore the Court exercise its discretion because the applicant had no other place to go for a relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.496" offset="11801370">For the Court to accept this motion is our belief that it would not only contravene national and state policy which relates to these complex problems of pollution, but also has an international aspect to it under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.493" offset="11885380">I'll confine my remarks solely to the national and state problem because my colleagues representing Dow have very ably handled the international problem and I'm sure they won't discuss it with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.988" offset="11951313">The complexities of ecology are involved here as well as the complexity of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.203" offset="11984227">The statutes of this United States as well as the various States have set up a very complex organization for handling the matters of pollution through administrative agencies and this is so important because the matter of pollution as being a problem within this country is relatively new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.605" offset="12101778">For instance, nobody knew that mercury in water created any problem before last March 1970, less than a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.284" offset="12156531">These companies said, we’re emptying water into the streams and the lakes felt that they were doing something that was not injurious to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.674" offset="12206059">Wyandotte had continued the same operation for over 32 years and under the inspections of the State of Michigan through their Water Resources Commission which inspected them periodically, never raised any question about mercury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.830" offset="12286725">There was no known problem and still science is not aware that there is even a problem now in so far as the metallic mercury which is inorganic being put into water creating the methyl mercury which is organic and which is ingested by fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.389" offset="12384946">Nobody has been able to prove that that comes from the inorganic mercury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.897" offset="12422980">As you all know, mercury is very heavy, it goes into water and it sinks right to the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.540" offset="12453491">Dow has its plant up at Sarnia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.034" offset="12475538">The Wyandotte Plant is at Wyandotte on the Detroit River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.650" offset="12489958">Neither of them are on Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.263" offset="12500407">Lake Erie is receiving mercury from multiple sources, Mr. Brown has tend to minimize it but it is coming not only from these sources if it can be proven they're coming from there and nobody is quite sure of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.101" offset="12575744">But there are other companies that are on those waters or on the streams emptying into Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.715" offset="12610226">There is much mercury in the air coming from furnaces burning coal and being a heavy substance, it immediately settles on the earth or on the top of the water and the surface waters carry it into Lake Erie and other bodies of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.221" offset="12700296">There is mercury coming from sewage disposal plants of all the metropolitan areas around that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.577" offset="12745644">There is mercury coming from less serious things for instance even the dentist run some of it down his sink when he is working on your teeth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.206" offset="13024214">Since the problem of mercury has come to the attention of the public and by the way it was accidentally discovered by a Swedish student who had known that the problem was studied in Sweden in so far as that it had to do with wildlife that consumes seed treated by fungicides and in the fungicides, mercury is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.813" offset="13142601">And so he knew that that problem existed and when he found by accident some methyl mercury which is the organic type within the fish up in Lake St. Clair and reported to the Canadian Government, they immediately reacted and before they could determine whether or not it was any serious problem, they put a prohibition on fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.806" offset="13250644">This set off all the publicity that has been given the problem but the manner in which methyl mercury is developed is unknown to science.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.793" offset="13322533">Now, counsel spoke of the Japanese incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.555" offset="13341550">Before commenting on that I’d like to say that no one in North America or Europe has been known to have been injured by ingesting mercury by eating fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.322" offset="13416678">The only incident that's known is the incident that occurred in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.670" offset="13442069">And there, the situation was much different because it wasn’t metallic mercury put in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.607" offset="13469759">It was organic mercury in the form of methyl mercury which of course is very toxic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.991" offset="13503300">It was in just -- it was induced directly into the water and a place where this village got all of its shellfish and as you know the Japanese eat fish about three times a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.044" offset="13563591">And therefore, they had a serious problem, but that problem doesn’t exist in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.986" offset="13599326">This leads me to the conclusion and a point which I would like to strongly urge to this Court in deciding whether or not it should exercise its discretion and that is that there is no emergency whatsoever in this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.627" offset="13669857">I attended the science conference of the University of Michigan held this fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.595" offset="13693785">Science is working on this problem everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.429" offset="13713115">The conclusions I learned from that meeting are few because science hasn’t advance very far in the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.771" offset="13750418">But I did learn this, that there is no eminent danger to the American people or the people of Canada and any location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.339" offset="13792737">I also learned that there are many bodies of water on this continent where fish are found to contain as much mercury as the ones in Lake Erie and there is no commercial dumping of mercury at all into those bodies of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.936" offset="14363146">The Michigan Court took up the problem and a consent decree was entered into by Wyandotte whereby a Wyandotte agreed to immediately set up a temporary means for keeping any mercury to go back into the water and to create a permanent recycling facility by May 1, 1971.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.931" offset="14671078">I don’t have time to go into them but the briefs cover them very thoroughly and Ohio has these alternate methods which are much more able to deal with a continuing problem and to work out solutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.515" offset="14737429">Then the facilities of this Court, if this Court were to take this case, I venture to say it won't be inundated with pollution and litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3703.060" offset="14915584">I’d like to just conclude by calling your specific attention to the prayers of this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.990" offset="14943378">First, that as the Court to declare that this is a public nuisance and that it be abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.123" offset="14975875">It has already been abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.950" offset="14999176">Secondly, it had asked for an injunction of something which is already seized be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.277" offset="15036479">Third, it has set a mandatory injunction to remove all mercury compounds from Lake Erie be entered whereas science knows of no way this can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.926" offset="15087052">In fact, a lot of the scientists are saying if it be attempted it will stir up the mercury so it will cause a greater problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.315" offset="15128639">And this decree could only be concerned with the proportionate share of the mercury in the water that the respective litigants have put in there and proportionate to what everybody has contributed to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.650" offset="15201991">And that has become a fundamental precedent of pollution law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.319" offset="15232606">How will that be determined? You know they can't measure the mercury in the lake because it is so infinite decimal in proportion to the size of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.640" offset="15293942">And lastly, they asked that damages be assessed to compensate for existing and future damages to Lake Erie, the fish and other wildlife, the vegetation and the citizens and inhabitants of Ohio which would be impossible to measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.924" offset="15375026">It seems to me their prayer indulges in asking this Court to do that which would be futile to take top tribunal of this country into something where we don’t know where we’re going.</text>

            <text syncTime="3850.922" offset="15507101">Since of March of 1970, our horizons of knowledge with respect to the problems of mercury pollution have expanded like universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.135" offset="15547956">In the appendix to our brief and reply the Court will find an article from the Washington Post dated December 28, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.389" offset="15596962">And the Court may know that the International Joint Commission came down with a report of 9 December 1970 and that report was filed both in Washington and Ottawa on the 14th of January 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.125" offset="15695914">I would like to review with the Court some of the facts which appear from these two most recent documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.271" offset="15728410">The first of these is that mercury is omnipresent, it’s present everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.484" offset="15749308">It occurs naturally and the conclusion would appear to be that only 50% of its occurrence is as a consequence of the effluent of manufacturing processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.634" offset="15817958">The second one is that up to 1.5 parts per million methyl mercury which is above the limit of 0.5 set by the Department of Health has been found in fish caught as much as 42 years ago in the United States and that presence of mercury in those fish is unlikely to attributable to pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3980.323" offset="16024639">Thirdly, the IJC reports that the major source of pollution generally of Lake Erie is the Detroit River and the second largest source of pollution of Lake Erie is reported by the International Joint Commission as being the State of Ohio itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.079" offset="16103737">Thirdly, the International Joint Commission, this most recent report, discusses mercury pollution but in particular it touches a first priority to phosphorus pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.388" offset="16152952">And it estimates the cause that something in the order of $2 billion and urges that both the Governments of Canada and United States commence immediately to clean up Lake Erie and to remove the phosphorus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.051" offset="16211571">This report has been universally well received in Canada or acting Prime Minister Mr. Sharp has committed his Government to implementing the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.328" offset="16260681">Mr. William P. Rogers, your Government has indicated and this quoted as saying that he has initiated follow-up action in a most urgent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.499" offset="16309373">There are technological limitations to the association of mercury pollution short of shutting the plants completely and abandoning them as was the alternative selected by Wyandotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.010" offset="16363395">And the fact of this exister set out in the appendices to the brief in reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.335" offset="16396727">But by way of comparison, the Court should examine the record file with respect to Detrex Chemical Industries Incorporated of Ashville, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.905" offset="16446986">Now, this is a company engaged in the same business as my client’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.016" offset="16467466">Under a cease and desist order of April 13, 1970 by the Government of the State of Ohio, in the material before the Court indicates that on May 11, 1970 and that's the last report we have, after the operational changes in that plant have been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.988" offset="16535280">Short of shutting that plant down, their escape was 1.2 pounds per day which escape, I tell the Court, is greater than the escape continuing from my client’s plant in this argument which is less than a pound a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.586" offset="16605706">And if the Court would look at the draft regulations of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry of the Government of Canada proposed to be introduced when the Government resumes to observe that the Government of Canada recognizes a technological limitation to the ability of mankind to shut off the flow of mercury from this type of an operation, short of shutting down the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.466" offset="16721272">Appendix 5 filed that the brief in reply is a list of eight companies provided by your Government upon our request is being known to have discharged mercury in Lake Erie and there are eight that have listed and I would point out to the Court that Dow and my clients are not one of them or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.621" offset="16801834">Two of these are companies situate in the State of Pennsylvania, one of them is a company situate in the New York State, one of them is a company situate in Michigan and four of them are companies resident within the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.268" offset="16860453">One cannot refrain from reference to the dictum of Mr. Justice Holmes in Missouri and Illinois 1905 it’s at page 522 whereas here the plaintiff has sovereign powers and deliberately permits discharges similar to those of which he complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.918" offset="16935058">It not only offers standard to which the defendant has the right to appeal, but it warrants the defendant in demanding the strict disproof that the plaintiff’s own conduct does not produce the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="4236.682" offset="17050102">It is my submission to the Court that the State of Ohio can legislatively and can administratively and can judicially take action against the polluters with its all jurisdiction and if they do, then the standard that they adopt with respect to their own polluters becomes the standard that we can comply with and I would say to the Court that we comply with the standard which is much higher than the standard which the State of Ohio expects of its own residents and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.716" offset="17182281">I would like to make one comment with respect to the brief of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.664" offset="17210075">Reliance is placed by the Solicitor General on a case of U.S. versus Aluminum Company of America and he also fairly mentioned the two cases to the Court Vanity Fair Mills and T. Eaton Company and Steele and Bulova Watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.757" offset="17274441">It’s my respectful submission that when these cases are examined carefully the only two cases which are governing the problem we’re confronted with is the Steele and Bulova Watch case as amplified and explained in Vanity Fair and T. Eaton Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.616" offset="17337866">Because in the Vanity Fair case, you’re dealing with precisely the situation we have here of a non-resident, citizen of a foreign country carrying on conduct in that foreign country subject to and regulated by the governments of that foreign country and the conduct is conduct which is approved of by that foreign county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.575" offset="17433684">Now, by that I'm not suggesting to the Court that my Government approves pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="4831.510" offset="19429439">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.382" offset="19452949">In our view in the light of the present knowledge and expertise concerning mercury pollution in Lake Erie, it is respectfully suggested Ohio’s proposed litigation is premature and may very well be ill-advised because of the posture in which the complaint comes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.663" offset="19562036">With about three defendants, when as my brothers have stated there are many known polluters of Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.742" offset="19618356">Mercury polluters, Municipal Government polluters, sewage, phosphates almost innumerable number including other chemicals which are now by reason of expertise being found to be also polluters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.881" offset="19718875">So, in the Court’s discretion, which I believe this Court has in this case in considering the issues raised by the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.873" offset="19774882">I believe with but three defendants, one being a foreign alien this Court would be proper and right and just in refusing to entertain Ohio’s complaint on the basis that complaint involves not only the judiciary but it also involves the political sides of our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.083" offset="19891702">Namely the executive and the legislative branches so that in the exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction, it is believe that this Court should examine carefully whether the complaint of Ohio on its phase demonstrates whether there is or is not a lack of satisfactory criteria which would enable this Court in the posture in which complaint comes to make a binding judicial determination which would be determinant of the problem of mercury pollution in the Great Lakes particularly Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.505" offset="20065364">When we know New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ontario also are interested in Lake Erie and its pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.949" offset="20127117">It seems very difficult for me to understand how this Court with the power that it has would be able to legislate or make a judicial finding which would satisfy Ohio in so far as Ohio’s common law is concerned leaving open a judicial determination of the rights and interests of the other states and that of Ontario.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.831" offset="20254699">Further, I believe this Court in exercising its jurisdiction and discretion should ascertain whether there are alternative forums available which could by reason of their structure reach a better determination in the long run and over a long period of time than the narrow kind finds of a judicial decree in the posture that pollution now is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.366" offset="20376848">With the state of expertise and the present knowledge that we have concerning pollution and the number of pollutants and the people involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.831" offset="20426689">I say this because to me it is most important that this Court consider that provisions of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 which was proclaimed by the two Governments wherein it was stated generally that in so far as Canada and the United States would be concerned pollution of the boundary waters which occurred on one side of the boundary of the other which resulted in harm to the inhabitants of the other side would be determined by means of an International Joint Commission and the history of what the International Joint Commission has done concerning investigation of pollution I believe is most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.806" offset="20618637">Beginning in 1918, the International Joint Commission handed down a report wherein in that report the International Joint Commission was required to investigate the extent, causes and where the boundary waters were polluted so as to be injurious to public health and unfit for domestic and other users.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.485" offset="20729292">In the 1918 report, the International Joint Commission concluded at that time that pollution was very intense along the shores of the Detroit and Niagara Rivers and that a condition existed which would impair the health and excellence and welfare of the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.639" offset="20817899">Now, what have the two Governments done since 1918?</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.213" offset="20844231">By two joint references, the executive branches of two Governments have referred the problem of pollution to the International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.742" offset="20894386">In 1946, both Governments requested the International Joint Commission to investigate pollution problems in the St. Mary, St. Clair, Detroit and Niagara Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.622" offset="20941824">And in 1950, the International Joint Commission reported certain water quality of objectives to restore and maintain the waters which they were requested to investigate.</text>

          <turn speaker="harley_j_mcneal" startTime="5225.196" stopTime="5701.080">
            <label>Mr. Harley J. McNeal</label>
            <text syncTime="5225.196" offset="21004204">The two Governments approved the recommendations and this resulted in pollution abatement programs being set up by various enforcement agencies in Canada and in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.448" offset="21057181">Now, as late as October of 1964, by another joint reference to the International Joint Commission the executive branches of the two Governments referred an investigation of the waters of Lake Erie and so far as pollution is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.619" offset="21129801">And by my brother Mr. Outerbridge, you have heard him state that the report concerning the investigation of pollution of the waters of Lake Erie was filed by the State Department wherein the International Joint Commission reported and I think it is helpful to summarize what the International Joint Commission found and reported through the State Department of the United States which filed the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.371" offset="21260831">The International Joint Commission found that until 1968, mercury was thought to be very stable that it could not be established with certainty that the concentration of a particular pollutant on one side of the boundary is due to any specific source on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.201" offset="21336168">Contaminants from both sides of the boundary are affecting and degrading the water qualities of Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.227" offset="21364276">In order to achieve effective pollution control, the laws of the Governments interested in Lake Erie’s pollution problems must be coordinated to avoid in action and inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.573" offset="21421641">The economic cause and social consequences of the pollution problem will be our most difficult one to assess.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.608" offset="21461765">The International Joint Commission also said studies are necessary to find solutions to the legislative legal and enforcement problems related to curtailing and eliminating the sources of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.896" offset="21518921">The solution of such social problems may well prove as difficult and time-consuming as the solution of all of the scientific and technical problems involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.403" offset="21565001">This brings me to my point, this Court exercising its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.467" offset="21597288">In as much as there has been no emergency, in so far as Ohio is concerned because Ohio within 10 days after it declared a fishing ban lifted that fishing ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.792" offset="21662490">The only species of fish which may not be commercially fished today is the walleye type.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.247" offset="21696345">The ban went into effect April 10th in 1970 and I believe as to most other fish was lifted on April 22nd or thereabouts 1970 so that the commercial fish men who were unable to commercially fished and sell fish were held up for a matter of 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.841" offset="21790699">The inhabitants of Ohio are not advised not to buy fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.203" offset="21820165">The commercial fishermen may sell fish and things are going on in so far as the taking of fish from Lake Erie as they did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.707" offset="21858200">Now, why is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.775" offset="21866454">Because at least in the newspaper reports it was found that 87% of the fish that were banned indicating that they were commercially unfit within 10 days after Ohio had put a ban on commercial fishing were found to be well below the dangerous level of metal mercury which was said to be toxic in so far as humans are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.121" offset="21987871">So that my point is that if there is no emergency in so far as Ohio’s position is concerned, this Court exercising its discretion may well refuse to entertain Ohio’s complaint because Ohio has a basis whereby it may bring exception in the Court of Common Pleas in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.363" offset="22080867">It may resort to the International Joint Commission and contrary to what my brother has Mr. Strauss has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.463" offset="22113259">I believe under Article II of the Boundary Waters Treaty which reads, “The exclusive jurisdiction and control of the use and diversion whether temporary or permanent of all waters on each side of the line which in the natural channels would flow across the boundary or enter the boundary waters are reserve to that nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.906" offset="22203016">And that if there is some damage or resulting in any injury on the other side of the boundary that nation which causes the condition shall give rise to the same rights and entitle the injured parties to the same legal remedies as if the entry took place in the country in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.365" offset="22284831">So that I say, in my interpretation of Article II that Ohio has the right to use the good offices of the Ontario courts to present this problem if they want to get at Dow Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.967" offset="22343241">They have the right to sue in their own jurisdiction in the Court of Common Pleas in Ohio and under the treaty Ohio has the perfect vehicle to have an adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.922" offset="22403009">My brother Mr. Strauss also said that they also said that under the treaty that no powers of arbitration yet in the Trail Smelter case which is the Landmark case involving pollution where a company in Canada was polluting the air in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.226" offset="22484302">The two nations, Canada and the United States referred the problem to the International Joint Commission. The International Joint Commission took testimony, learned about the issues and reported back to the two Governments with recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.708" offset="22558177">As a result of that investigation and the hearings that were had it was decided that a commission would be chosen a tribunal appointed and that tribunal proceeded to find liability and to assess damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.862" offset="22626826">These was all done under the Boundary Waters Treaty and under Article X of the Boundary Waters Treaty, it is provided that where there is a dispute between the United States and Canada, the high contracting parties may refer the matter to an umpire chosen in accordance with the proceedings proscribed in the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the Haig Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.035" offset="22767470">For the pacific settlement of international disputes such umpire shall have the power to render a final decision with respect to those matters and questions so referred on which the Commission shall fail to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.134" offset="22823894">So that there is built-in to the Boundary Waters Treaty -- a provision whereby if the International Joint Commission so recommends to the two nations that there be a finding of fault and a determination of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.279" offset="22888469">This can be accomplished under the terms and provisions of the Boundary Waters Treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="5733.026" offset="23035486">And this has been done and the Landmark case is the Trail Smelter case to burden this Court with this kind of litigation which would be interminable by reason of the information that one has to acquire, the scientific knowledge that has to be presented, the witnesses who would have to be subpoenaed, who would have to appear would seem to me to be an improper forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="6169.439" offset="24781093">A master can do find job of it if all we got from this Court ultimately into decree where a final order barring any further pollution of mercury it would be a fine thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.495" offset="24833337">And if you added to that money damages to punish these polluters for putting into the Great Lakes water this deadly poison which is not an ordinary pollution, we would’ve accomplish something which would be a deterrent for all other polluters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6200.279" offset="24904495">I say to you they are still polluting, I say to you the pollutant -- the mercury that they put into the lake still being acted upon by biological forces which are making it more and more deadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.542" offset="24957576">And I say there is an emergency that will not occasion too much difficulty and a master could well handle this matter.</text>
