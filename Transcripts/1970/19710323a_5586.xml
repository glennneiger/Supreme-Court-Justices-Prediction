            <label>Ms. Elizabeth Roediger Rindskopf</label>
            <text syncTime="13.308" offset="156609">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.838" offset="170715">This action arises on a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.109" offset="195793">Basically, we're taking the constitutionality of the Georgia Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act which appears as Sections 92 (a) - 601 through 615 of the Georgia code annotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.096" offset="247724">I'll begin with the description of the facts in this case which I think will serve the dual purpose of making clear the operation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.622" offset="281893">Basically, our contention is that the Act violates Due Process of law by operating to suspend the license plates and vehicle certificates, as well as driver's licenses of certain uninsured motorists involved in certain accidents in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.819" offset="370604">The facts in this case are as follows, petitioner Bell was driving his own automobile in the small town of Sparks Georgia November 24. 1968, despite the fact that he was driving 10 miles under the speed limit, he was unable to avoid hitting a bicycle ridden by a five year old cyclist who had neglected to yield to a stop sign and entered the path of his incoming vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.316" offset="468616">The child suffered a broken leg as well as a broken hip and other injuries and the accident was duly investigated by the Chief of Police of Sparks Georgia, who noted that the child had failed to yield to the stop sign and found the petitioner was guilty of no traffic violations and consequently gave him no citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.527" offset="549491">Subsequent to the accident, the parents of the child filed an affidavit with the respondent, Department of Public Safety, alleging that the child had sustained damages in excess of $10,000.00 and that these damages had been caused by petitioner Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.895" offset="622947">Now, let me digress here to point out that it was the affidavit filed by the parents that triggered the operation of the Act and once triggered, the Act operates automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.495" offset="665370">So that petitioner thereupon was sent a notice of order of suspension which required him to do one of three things or to face the suspension of his driver's license as well as the certificates of registration for his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.228" offset="732244">The three things were, A, he must demonstrate that he had proof of liability insurance at the time of the accident, B, that he had entered into a settlement agreement whereby he'd either already paid the damages claimed or he was doing so on installment basis, or C, he had to post bond in the total amount of the damages claimed as well as obtain liability insurance for one year in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.045" offset="843525">Now, these three things are mutually exclusive, and he need not do all but he must do one of the three things to avoid the suspension.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.312" offset="5660609">Yes, the question was, why have states not employed compulsory liability insurance and my answer was and I base this answer on some reading I've done in the Georgia legislative journals that the insurance lobby has powerfully pressured the states not to have compulsory liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.535" offset="5741484">They feel that it would expensive for them to have to insure the entire driving public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.960" offset="5763218">They would much rather have this kind of a system and of course the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act that's under attack here fits hand and glove with the uninsured motorist provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.703" offset="5814209">In Georgia, every insurance policy must include a provision which allows the insured to have coverage should he be in an accident with an uninsured motorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.187" offset="5864155">The insurance company then goes against that uninsured motorist on a system of subrogation, its not called subrogation but it is the same thing and that points up again that this Act is generally brought into play by insurance companies who have already paid off the other driver and are now seeking to either sue or to pressure into settlement the uninsured motorist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.409" offset="6217017">But what we have done here as said in Georgia, if you are going to have insurance, liability insurance, we know that the persons who maybe injured will be covered, will be compensated for the injury on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.631" offset="6277935">If you choose not to have liability insurance, then we are going to require you to put up security in the amount claimed until the question is settled in a court of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.857" offset="6422758">That isn't quite so in practice Mr. Justice because the director does have a discretion to increase the amount or decrease the amount and although the statute says that it is not to be below the amount that's claimed, he does in fact do so if he believes it's too much and it did so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.183" offset="6508126">The amount claimed was $10,000.00, the bond that was required or the security that was required was $5,000.00, so this is a concrete example of the practical aspect of it where it is limited to an amount that in the judgment of the director would be sufficient to cover the possible judgment that might be obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.363" offset="6908844">And so we are simply delaying the requirement and the person at the outset of getting his license and of licensing his car knows that, it's contained in the driver's manual what the requirements of the safety responsibility law are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.109" offset="6971852">So, if he chooses to bear the risk of having to put up security at a later time, then that's his own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.957" offset="7015215">He can avoid that by getting insurance at the beginning and that's what the state is trying to get people to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.592" offset="7037785">They're trying to encourage them to get insurance at the beginning but they say we won't require it because we know that there are some people that aren't of great means and would rather not pay insurance premiums over the years and take the risk of being involved in an accident and having to post security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.780" offset="7118451">So that in the event, there is a judgment against him, there will be money there to cover that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.947" offset="8919124">No, it has never been suspended because of the state, they haven't granted and so as a matter of fact, that points up a very good thing about this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.785" offset="8958516">When Mr. Bell was brought under the provisions of the safety responsibility law, the provision was that it would be a three year suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.923" offset="8995088">That has since been changed by the legislature to a one year suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.248" offset="9012328">There were two cases that were taken to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the one year suspension was retroactive so that in cases like Mr. Bell's, a person who was going along with the three year suspension could all of a sudden get his license back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.860" offset="9070843">Well, one of the cases has been decided but not on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.680" offset="9086098">And as of yesterday, the second case which has that question in it has not yet been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.098" offset="9111803">So that we could have a situation here where Mr. Bell by virtue of the Court of Appeal's decision in the Dobson case could very well get his license or never have a suspension because it maybe moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.309" offset="9164570">The department takes the position that when they order a suspension as of a certain date, no matter what happens that date and if we go back now and the Court here affirms the Court of Appeals, the only period of time for which the suspension would occur would be until the three years would be up in 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.784" offset="12458506">Sniadach of course, is the garnishment case and in that case, there were as a matter of fact two cases mentioned where summary proceedings were regarded to be warranted because of what the Court called extraordinary situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.485" offset="12537292">One of those was Coffin brothers and that was the situation in which the bank holders or the bank stockholders were assessed after the bank had been closed for the purpose of paying off depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.611" offset="12601866">And the assessment was made and execution was allowed thereon before there was a determination in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.024" offset="12643453">There was allowed to be execution and Due Process was raised in that situation and the Court felt there believed that that was an extraordinary situation and that the state had a right to protect the depositors this way and it was not a denial of Equal Protection or Due Process rather to require the stockholders to put up that money without a question of there being first of all a Court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.226" offset="12748257">And I think it was very important to this case that in Coffin brothers of course which is cited in Sniadach, the Court found that when they became stockholders they agreed to do this and it's the same thing when you become a driver or take out a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.108" offset="12815757">You agree to put up the security if you're involved in an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.767" offset="12838431">It's a condition of your license, just like obeying the other traffic laws would be or having the inspections or getting tags.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.260" offset="12872391">It's a condition that's put on at the outset and that was one of the differences that was recognized in Coffin brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.526" offset="12901439">Now, Owenbee (ph) was another one that was mentioned and that involved a foreign attachment where in order for you to contest or to defend against foreign attachment, you had to put up security before any determination which is the same thing as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.211" offset="12968208">And the court found that that was not a violation of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.975" offset="12983254">Now, Sniadach with the garnishment situation, the Court said in these Due Process cases, we've got to look at two things, the nature of the property and the problems of procedural Due Process that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.152" offset="13043963">In Sniadach, the nature of the property was the man's wages and the Court regarded that as a fundamental right that he had to his wages without the state stepping in to help a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.842" offset="13098715">First, we think, it's very different when we're talking about posting security and the only right that he's deprived of there is the right to the interest on that security for two years, now, that's a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.531" offset="13409468">One of the conditions is get insurance or be willing to put up security and that's not analogous to a Wade situation where a man goes out and has a right to his wages without any interference from the state except for tax withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.703" offset="13474147">But here, the whole right is conditioned on a privilege which is given by the state and which maybe conditioned as so long as the general welfare is being encouraged thereby.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.508" offset="13653452">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.213" offset="13656273">I'll try and be brief, I have only a few points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.942" offset="13671111">My first point goes to what Mr. Justice Marshall just asked Mrs. Beasley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.719" offset="13686262">I'd like to point out that when these documents that are required for the operation of a vehicle in Georgia are suspended, the person not only loses the ability to drive his car, he can't sell his car, he can do nothing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.650" offset="13741955">I suppose he could sell it for junk but he cannot sell it because he doesn't have registration papers for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.965" offset="13763271">The state has taken those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.023" offset="13771421">Secondly, I'd like to go perhaps a little more deeply into the individual facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.289" offset="13792528">The accident as you remember occurred on the 24th of November 1968, the affidavit which triggered the operation of this Act was filed I believe February 28, I may not be exactly right on the date, it was in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.184" offset="13844146">So there was quite a lapse of time there and it's interesting to note that it was an attorney who sent the first letter asking how to start the Act operating for the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.926" offset="13887091">Now, from that time to this, there has been no suit filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.912" offset="13902973">As a matter of fact, the father's right to sue has now lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.620" offset="13917811">The statute of limitations in Georgia is two years and it is run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.164" offset="13932022">The child may still have an opportunity to sue after his disability, his minority is removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.709" offset="13958248">But I think this shows clearly the point that what's happening here is this is being used as pressure tactic to attempt to get a settlement where you might not stand a ghost of a chance of getting a judgment if you were forced to go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.934" offset="14015091">My third point concerns the discussion we had on the administrative procedure here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.533" offset="14037556">We are not asking that before this act is ever called into operation, a hearing must be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.885" offset="14062947">We are simply saying that in a case where an individual believes himself to be not liable, he got a chance to have a hearing, to request it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.149" offset="14099937">And I will simply refer the court to the letter from the Arizona, Department of Public Safety, I think the statements -- this appears at the end of my brief, the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.123" offset="14147897">I think the statements in there are helpful as to the operation of that Act, they haven't found it a hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.262" offset="14168377">And they've also found that of the administrative hearings they've held, some 700 per year, there have been a total in a three year span of eight appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.036" offset="14211532">I think that shows the success of the operation of the Act as we see, it should properly be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.677" offset="14242043">I have nothing further, thank you.</text>
