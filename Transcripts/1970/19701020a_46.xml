            <label>Mr. Armand Derfner</label>
            <text syncTime="15.591" offset="165700">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.805" offset="182627">This is an appeal under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 of a three-judge court in the Southern District of Mississippi, a fourth such appeal in three terms of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.363" offset="232782">First three having decided by this Court, reversing the lower court in the case of Allen versus State Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.837" offset="270712">I believe the question on the merits here is quite simple and I plan to devote about a small portion of the argument in demonstrating the court below was wrong on all three of the questions that it faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.750" offset="318360">The vital question in this case is a question for relief and that question goes to the heart of whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 is to be permitted to occupy the critical place that Congress intended for it in 1965 and reaffirmed in the strongest possible terms when it extended the Act in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.132" offset="411878">To advert very briefly to the facts, the City of Canton in Mississippi for its municipal elections in 1969 adopted three changes from the procedure that it had governed the prior municipal election in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.987" offset="475303">They went from individual board elections to at large elections in a town in which there are two wards that are very heavily black.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.711" offset="506232">They moved the polling places, in one case from the town square to an old jail and in another case from the middle of the black neighborhood and heavily black ward to a point just adjacent to a newly annexed white neighborhood, and third, they extended the boundaries of the town in such a way as to add several hundred net additional white residents, that is several hundred more white residents than black residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.401" offset="620962">wards, Mr. Justice Blackmun, are 3 and 4 and my brief gives, I believe the record too gives the registration figures for all the wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.946" offset="671117">All these changes are familiar ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.503" offset="681357">They are all changes of the type that had been submitted by other jurisdictions to the Attorney General as can be shown by looking at page 309 of the house hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.830" offset="714689">They are all changes of the type that Congress mentioned many, many times in the debates in 1969 and 1970 on the extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.194" offset="748126">The best example of that is perhaps Congressman McCulloch who was perhaps the leading minority member in the House, involved both in the 1965 Act and 1970 extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.316" offset="788668">He was in each of these three kinds of changes as types they were covered by the voting by Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.438" offset="825135">Judge Nixon, the single judge, on the basis of the boundary extension alone granted an injunction against having the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.787" offset="854497">The case then went forward and was decided by the three-judge court which held without quite saying ever, without saying actually that any of these changes that was not covered by Section 5, it went into the motives of the changes which this Court has conclusively held are to be decided only by the Attorney General or by the District of Columbia Court and pronounced these changes did not violate Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.916" offset="995035">This Court in the Allen case made it clear and I think Justice Harlan asked that precise question there that that is not a question we have to decide now or have to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.427" offset="1029099">All we have to prove is, if there was a change and there is an adequate procedure set up by Section 5 to determine what the good faith or lack thereof was.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.787" offset="1122513">All it has to do is alter these lines and at that point Congress says that is a matter that you cannot take up any place, but with the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.578" offset="1165667">That ends the matter in a Section 5 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.982" offset="1175280">The court below had only to decide as Judge Nixon said when he granted the temporary restraining order, I have to decide, was there a change?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.580" offset="1205687">The answer is, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.660" offset="1305997">They were certainly aware of it, it in fact having come from -- well three of those cases having come from that same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.802" offset="1330552">So I say that the merits are easy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.387" offset="1348942">The vital question is what is the relief to be given in this case, and on a very simple plain, that is an easy question too.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.880" offset="1378931">The very simple plain says there must be a new election, and we maintain there must be a new election and that there can't be any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.264" offset="1416443">The law is clear in election cases, in the cases such as Hamer versus Campbell in the Fifth Circuit, United States versus Barbara County, a case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.080" offset="1459702">Cases such as Hadnott versus Amos for that example, that if you assert you remedies in timely fashion in a voting case, particularly, in a Fifteenth Amendment case, but certainly equally well in a Fourteenth Amendment case such as a property tax cases or more recently apportionment cases, then if it develops after the election has being held -- that you didn't get the relief and election is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.355" offset="1556773">If it develops thereafter that you are entitled to have an injunction, that you are entitled to have the election set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.713" offset="1650186">In Allen, if you are talking about this case, this Court said specifically that these Section 5 question, coverage questions involve complex issues of first impression.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.169" offset="1728031">I think that was a clear indication as clear -- perhaps as clear as the indication as the explicit language in the tax cases that thenceforward, jurisdiction would have been on notice that if they didn't submit the proper remedy was a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.314" offset="1788635">And that is a traditional, as I say, basically it's come to be a traditional equitable remedy in election cases and I think that the ordinary rule there would be that there should a new election unless there are special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.838" offset="1838686">There were special circumstances in Allen as they are often are when a court, and this court especially decides a case involving a whole new body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.350" offset="1880795">There are no special circumstances in this case and there is no reason that the City of Canton has advanced or could advance for why it should not be governed by the general rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.058" offset="2587564">At least as good and no better and the declaratory judgment doesn't give us a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.567" offset="2613687">Quite frankly, I think in this case what we have is the advantage of a Congress that in 1969 and 1970 debated extensively, several 100 pages of a congressional record and at least 1200 to 1500 pages of hearings of reports, what should happen to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.792" offset="2694562">I think it's a fair statement, that the bulk of that debate aside from question such -- involving new question such as the general banning of the literacy test and the 18-year old vote and the residence and absentee provision, the bulk of the argument dealt with Section 5 and the debate is replete with discussion over the importance of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.323" offset="2796648">Basically the history is quite clear, a Bill was introduced which I believe the record would show had administration backing, the justice department testified for it, a Bill was introduced which would have abolished the pre-clearance procedures of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.226" offset="2852237">This Bill was supported in critical testimony by the Attorney General and especially by Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Norman.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.442" offset="2885151">In his testimony, it appears at pages 500 and following of the senate hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.496" offset="2909393">At those hearings, both the Attorney General and Mr. Norman testified explicitly that section -- that there was no need for Section 5 because in fact all Section 5 did was to provide the following remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.938" offset="2963101">This is explicitly stated by Mr. Norman, Section 5 provides only the remedy that if you win a Section 5 case, then the jurisdiction that didn't submit the matter to the Attorney General or the District of Columbia Court must then submit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.078" offset="3023705">I think the congressional debates and the outcome of what happened in Congress is as clear reputation of that position as is possible to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.455" offset="3065187">And if I might just, at this point discuss very briefly the legislative history, and I might say that much of this is not specifically cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.909" offset="3115029">There were numerous statements in Congress dealing with the importance of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.108" offset="3139793">There was no report from the Senate Judiciary Committee or from any Subcommittee because the Bill had been submitted, the extension Bill had been submitted under rule requiring a report or requiring to be reported out by April 1st, there was no time for a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.780" offset="3202487">There was however a joint statement signed by ten senators who constituted the majority of the 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.751" offset="3226415">This report is in the congressional record and is at pages 2756 and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.415" offset="3265076">It's a monthly report, discusses Section 5 in great detail and has three italicized sentences throughout the whole report, each of which italicized sentences refers to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.024" offset="3315440">As an example, this section, it's on page 2756, this section in effect freezes election procedures in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown to be non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.332" offset="3364655">There were other even more explicit statements representative Corman (ph) in discussing the differences between the two Bills said, the key point is whether or not federal power can effectively stop the states from changing their voting laws for discriminatory purposes, that is the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.229" offset="3428289">Best of all Congressman McCulloch, put it in a nutshell what the importance of the Section 5 was and how it had to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.327" offset="3468727">There was a lot of discussion about whether there had been a great deal of compliance or a small degree of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.787" offset="3490565">There had been at that time some 400 enactments or changes submitted to the Justice department.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.023" offset="3523480">Congressman McCulloch said, it's on page 12136, the pre-clearance procedure, and this is critical, serves psychologically to control the proliferation of discriminatory laws and practices because each change must first be federally reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.969" offset="3587218">Thus, Section 5 serves to prevent discrimination before it starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.008" offset="3611355">That psychological effect, the idea of creating an incentive to jurisdictions to comply was repeatedly stated, Senator Kennedy said it, Congressman Ryan said it, Senator Bayh said it, Senator Tydings said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.799" offset="3666526">If the court wishes, I can supply these citations, but it is combed through the hearings and combed through the debates on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.189" offset="3700172">I submit that there is no conceivable way to carry out that affect, that is to create that incentive and to make it strong, unless Section 5 carries an advantage for obeying it and a disadvantage for disobeying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.826" offset="3786689">And I think its clear and Congress, I think certainly meant this to be the case that if all you do when you lose a case is go submit it to the Attorney General, you have not suffered a disadvantage and there is no conceivable incentive created to submit laws in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.530" offset="3869445">It's clear that in this situation Congress meant Section 5 to be as effective as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.019" offset="3895463">Senator Hart made it very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.164" offset="3908002">He said, “We don't have enough successes around here to be wasteful of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.784" offset="3922526">Condition of this country argues very strong that we manage to develop an instrument effective to enable us to deliver on promises of long standing, we had better not dilute it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="965.414" offset="3965053">The question of the remedy is inseparable from the question of the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.416" offset="3985011">Congress meant Section 5 to carry with it a remedy that would make the hopes of Congress in passing Section 5 fully effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.608" offset="4021791">The only possible remedy is a remedy that says, “If you do not submit, you do not have a valid law.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.521" offset="5845452">There I think it is clear that Mr. Normal is talking about a court not being willing to give any relief beyond requiring submission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.936" offset="5923088">Mr. Norman said, “No, if we went to court and filed the paper and said we objected to this, they threaten to use it anyway, please enjoy them using it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.195" offset="6024129">Now, that is what it says right here in the words of Section 5, I won't bother to prolong the hearing by reading that, but that is what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.579" offset="8589667">“Does the Court wish to extend or expand the interpretation of Section 5 as laid down in the Allen case to the extent which appellants urge and reach the appalling result that 95% of any Municipal enactment or administration of an enactment would have to be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States or to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia before its effective or should the Court put the bit and bridle of reason of the common sense on Section 5 and confine it within that practical bounds which will carry out the intent of Congress that the election processes shall not be discriminatory and at the same time ensure a municipality the authority and the power to conduct the management of its affairs in an orderly fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.159" offset="8812022">Because to do of what the appellants urge you to do and to hold these annexations to be void for the purpose of elections which I don't see how you can do that, it's either got to be a valid annexation or an invalid annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.111" offset="8867819">You cannot have the people in the city paying taxes and not able to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.998" offset="8895404">And so the things that, that will happen are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.427" offset="8913063">You question the policing power and jurisdiction in these areas and since 1965 in one case and 1966 in another and since 1968 in another, you have people who have paid municipal taxes for period of five years, some of them in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.195" offset="8984116">You have to consider the affect on zoning, housing codes, plumbing building codes, on just about every facet of Municipal Government in the annexed areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.410" offset="9033017">It occurs to us that Section 5 interpretation should be limited to the election processes which we could summarize as this, the qualifications and eligibility to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.968" offset="9087248">The registration process itself, the physical act of casting ballot and the right which this Court has indelibly inscribed on the American couches of having your vote, or the vote of each elector cast with the same value and the same weight as all other votes cast in that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.533" offset="9165511">And unless some enactment or administration of an enactment would affect one of these four phases of the alleged processes then it should not come within Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.119" offset="9223816">Of course if the enactment or the administration of the enactment remotely affects and can be shown to have a discriminatory purpose or effect, inadequate rights prevail under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, as the case might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.641" offset="9285987">We just urge upon the Court, these annexations should not be construed as coming within Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.296" offset="12408560">It would be appropriate for me to just state a brief, like we stated in response to questions posed in slightly different force by Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.634" offset="12461955">Basically the question was how can you expect or how were the apportionment fair under Reynolds against Sims or how were the ward elections and Mr. Marshall's question was relating to the expansion of boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.283" offset="12524544">I think basically what Section 5 had said is that -- is that the certainty that these are valid under the Fifteenth Amendment, that these have been passed in good faith is so important that Section 5 must be enforced that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.655" offset="12601971">But these are not questions to be considered, nor even that we have to make any proof on in the record below and that as to the apportionment, a slight dislocation in the question of proper apportionment of one election is not of such consequence, will not dislocate the law as much as allowing a change to pass without proper clearance under Section 5, which if it happened, would create every incentive for every jurisdiction, never to submit another change under Section 5.</text>
