            <text syncTime="21.528" offset="189524">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.652" offset="210004">The central question in this case is Bruton there.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.107" offset="231842">Was the respondent O'Neil, given the opportunity to cross-examine a co-defendant Runnels, who in a confession implicated O'Neil or to perhaps phrase it as the Court of Appeal did, was there an opportunity for effective cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.376" offset="344900">I think a central to the determination of this question is examination of the purpose of confrontation, and is this Court recently said in Dutton v. Evans and I quote, ?The decisions of this Court make it clear that the mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth determining process in criminal trials by assuring that the trier of fact has a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.?</text>
            <text syncTime="96.381" offset="488887">Now before looking to the options available, when the confessing co-defendant takes that stand as Mr. Runnels did in this case, let's see what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.439" offset="553148">This case does not involve a Pointer type issue where the witness never takes a stand and is never cross-examined, never available.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.390" offset="592959">This is not a Douglas type issue where the co-defendant takes the stand, but by invoking the privilege against self-incrimination removes himself from any possibility of either direct or cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.459" offset="1145187">Mr. Justice White, this is precisely what happened when the state prosecutor cross-examined Mr. Runnels.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.000" offset="1175385">He went back and said, ?Well, didn't you talk to Officer Traphagen??</text>

            <text syncTime="278.110" offset="1215822">Sure, he did and, didn't you say you did?</text>

            <text syncTime="281.100" offset="1227734">I never -- I -- once I found out that I had a right to attorney, I calmed up and didn't say anything further.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.881" offset="1254902">And the -- then the prosecutor said, well, didn't you really do this, didn't you really commit this crime and he said, no I didn't do any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.723" offset="1306311">This was -- these options where all available to Mr. O'Neil's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.541" offset="1337553">He complains that perhaps, he couldn't bring out the fact or that he couldn't bring up the fact that maybe O'Neil was have some kind of motive, have some kind of dislike for -- maybe Runnels have some kind of dislike for O'Neil because O'Neil had sort of told on him as Officer Traphagen had told Mr. Runnels.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.771" offset="1450506">But, he could have asked Runnels that he could have said do you dislike O'Neil?</text>
            <text syncTime="342.681" offset="1474121">Runnels would have said, ?No.?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.608" offset="1481853">Would your dislike for O'Neil could have caused you to make this statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="347.858" offset="1494810">I didn't make any statement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.288" offset="1500557">I like O'Neil, we didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.573" offset="1513618">This was available, but it wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.407" offset="1528978">Now, so I think, I think that that you've really pointed out, perhaps the ultimate question, the better question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.462" offset="1589269">Why should O'Neil attack the statement at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="373.976" offset="1599300">Cross-examination is a tool, but you don't use tools unwisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.367" offset="1616854">You don't use tools if you don't need to and they didn't need to.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.275" offset="1636498">Now, I, myself have wondered how the Court of Appeals could say there wasn't any effective cross-examination in this case or wasn't any possibility?</text>
            <text syncTime="395.034" offset="1683519">The Court of Appeals didn't say and Mr. O'Neil has proffered a few explanations in his brief before this Court, and we touched on some of them with my answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.702" offset="1750183">Namely, he says that, ?You can only have effective cross-examination if the witness -- if you can bring out qualifications in his testimony of other things.?</text>
            <text syncTime="423.408" offset="1796995">Again, this is confusing the technique with the purpose of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.821" offset="1822699">I mentioned again, that there's not point to probe Runnels' anger.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.705" offset="1846209">He could have asked Runnels if he was angry at him, but he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.146" offset="1863973">He says you can't probe the statement for omissions or errors or inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.415" offset="1885080">Well, you don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.143" offset="1891976">This statement -- this statement, what more could he want?</text>
            <text syncTime="451.204" offset="1908172">Then what Runnels -- then what Runnels gave him on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.793" offset="1922591">As the dissenting judge below pointed out, ?the best O'Neil could hope for would be for Runnels to testify that the confession was false and that O'Neil did not commit the crimes.?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.557" offset="1981628">Here, Runnels gave O'Neil all that and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.181" offset="1992077">He denied that he confessed and said at O'Neil was not at the scene of the crimes.</text>
