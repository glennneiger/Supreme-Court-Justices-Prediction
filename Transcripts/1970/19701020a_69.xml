            <text syncTime="8.326" offset="138700">Ms. Soloff you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Brenda Soloff</label>
            <text syncTime="12.454" offset="155209">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.785" offset="172554">At issue in this case, is the ability of the agency which is charged with administering a local Aid to Families with Dependent Children program to verify information which an applicant or a recipient is concededly obliged to furnish for eligibility purposes and to verify it as meaningfully as possible by a visit to the home by an agency caseworker.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.268" offset="286448">Or put another way, the question is whether the adult AFDC client has an absolute right to refuse access to her home and still receive assistance, no matter what her conceded obligations maybe, and even if a refusal is entirely arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.529" offset="359487">Essentially, we submit that since AFDC assistance is premised on the care of children in homes which would otherwise be unable to provide for them, that the request for access to the home is a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.548" offset="423643">In addition, since that request is denied the result is neither entry nor a contempt proceeding nor automatic termination of benefits, but a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.156" offset="478083">The home visit apparatus does not infringe any Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.716" offset="500234">No warrant procedures required to validate the home visit, nor could any such procedure more fully protect the AFDC client against the arbitrary exercise of the party than the one that we have now.</text>

            <label>Ms. Brenda Soloff</label>
            <text syncTime="125.508" offset="607441">There is a policy in New York City that it be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.281" offset="630533">The affidavits do indicate that it was not given in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.933" offset="645162">I would think that, that could be an issue which could be resolved at a hearing which is held.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="141.433" stopTime="143.737">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="141.433" offset="671180">But in any event in this case it's conceded that there was an advance notice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="143.737" stopTime="406.970">
            <label>Ms. Brenda Soloff</label>
            <text syncTime="143.737" offset="680375">In this case, there definitely was advance notice for approximately a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.858" offset="712871">The adult appellee in this case Barbara James first applied for assistance in April 1967, pursuant to the state regulation, requiring that a home visit be made to initial applicants for assistance, such a visit was made, the apartment was seen and various aspects of eligibility were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.776" offset="792492">The worker was not then or afterward persuaded the appellee's eligibility, but recommended that the case be open because of the imminent birth of her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.596" offset="839826">Thereafter, there were regular, periodical contacts with appellee, also as required by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.779" offset="868561">These contacts took the form of additional home visits to attempt to verify eligibility and to attempt to deal with appellee's many demands, the greater number of which were seem to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.504" offset="923418">During these visits, no worker went behind close doors or poked or probed into any closed area and at each visit the child was seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.784" offset="960512">Ultimately, she notified a caseworker who had sought to make an appointment by letter a week in advance that under no circumstances and at no time would the worker be admitted to the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.282" offset="1018504">On May 27, 1969 before any termination of benefits, a hearing was held by the department at which appellee and counsel were present and at which counsel represented that although his client would talk anywhere, she would not talk at home because that would violate her right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.104" offset="1101887">The referee found that refusal to comply with the policy of contact by home visit justified the case -- closing the case, pointing out and I quote from his opinion, “The home visit which Mrs. James refuses to permit is for the purpose of determining if there are any changes in her situation that might effect her eligibility to continue to receive public assistance or that might affect the amount of such assistance and to see if there are any social services which the department of social services can provide to the family.”</text>
            <text syncTime="286.741" offset="1252352">He, therefore, affirmed the decision to close the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.496" offset="1271369">Appellee did not proceed as she could have to a state fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.091" offset="1285789">Instead a complaint was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the termination of benefits for refusal to consent to a home visit without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.782" offset="1340541">A statutory three-judged court was convened and its majority opinion, the court held that a home visit without a warrant is an invasion of the constitutionally protected right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.219" offset="1390279">That alternative methods are available to verify eligibility and that should a home visit be deemed required to consider a certain aspect of eligibility and the applicant or recipient refuses to allow the visit, a suitably restricted search warrant may issue to force the client to disclose the terms of his eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.733" offset="1480349">The majority rejected any idea that the home visit could legitimately ascertain the wellbeing of the child, although I think somewhat inconsistently it also provided in its alternative possibilities for verification of the wellbeing of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.544" offset="1559552">The first point to be made, I think, is that the home visit as presently structured is a reasonable and necessary investigative tool in AFDC cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.657" offset="1604065">There can be no doubt that it serves valid purposes, it provides information on a need for and the extent of assistance, and it provides information on the extent to which the assistance is being used for and is working for the only purpose of the program, that is the care children in their homes and in this connection it also serves to identify immediate areas of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.961" offset="1729243">It is conceded --</text>

            <text syncTime="463.519" offset="1959539">And in this case, what's essentially happened is that it's increased to a 100%, but there is that core of sample cases and --</text>

            <text syncTime="981.716" offset="4032303">The result of that was a support hearing, a payment of rent arrears, a reference to a marriage counselor, but an ineligible family was not put on the rolls and that was purely technical eligibility factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.004" offset="4113387">The other case was far more drastic in what happened and far less precise in what the worker could determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.003" offset="4157482">This was a recertification visit under New York Law and in non-experimental area, under the present system, and the worker walked into the home and knew that the family consisted of the mother and three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.640" offset="4223937">And she walked into the home and she saw the mother and the oldest child and not the other two children and the home atmosphere quite simply disturbed her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.742" offset="5088381">This is particularly true with preschool children to whom there is otherwise no access until something happens to them.</text>
