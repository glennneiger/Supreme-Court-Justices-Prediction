            <text syncTime="55.651" offset="325987">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.946" offset="379173">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.602" offset="405817">My name is William F. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.410" offset="413027">I am the Assistant Attorney General for the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.735" offset="426297">This morning or this afternoon I will --</text>
            <text syncTime="84.444" offset="441135">Arguing on behalf of appellant, the Governor of the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.204" offset="456182">I am accompanied this afternoon at counsel table by Theodore L. Sendak, Attorney General for the State of Indiana, and Richard C. Johnson, his Chief Deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.876" offset="506859">In our brief in this case we presented this Court with six issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.050" offset="531623">This afternoon the State will concentrate its argument on two of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.086" offset="551685">The first issue is whether the constitution permits or requires that a racial/socioeconomic group be proportionally represented in the State Legislature by representatives elected from that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.197" offset="608110">Secondly, whether the constitution requires all state legislative districts to be the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.798" offset="638516">If time allows, the state will discuss the remaining issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.957" offset="655235">I would be glad to, would be pleased to answer any questions this Court may have regarding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.577" offset="685641">This action began as an action for declaratory injunctive relief in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.795" offset="718555">It was brought by Negro residents of Marion County, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.006" offset="739349">Marion County is one of 92 counties in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.969" offset="759202">The plaintiffs below challenged the constitutionality of the Marion County multi-member districting scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.798" offset="798595">Marion County provides for the at large election of 15 members of the House representatives and 8 members of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.119" offset="895875">This action does not involve congressional districting, is limited solely to state legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.027" offset="927431">Following this Court's decision in Baker v. Carr, Indiana began the long road to reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.428" offset="953135">In 1963, it reapportioned, in 1965 it again reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.888" offset="990960">The 1965 Act was declared unconstitutional by the District Court in the case of Stout v. Bottorff, that's the first District Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.478" offset="1033279">A special session of the 65 legislature was called, and they again enacted an Apportionment Act, that was the Apportionment Act of 1965 and that is the subject of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.154" offset="1088031">It is interesting to note that one of the plaintiffs in this action was the member of the 1965 legislature, that enacted the 1965 Act, that he voted for that Act and that he now attacks that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.240" offset="1152293">There were six plaintiffs in the Court below, one was a resident of the Lake County, another County in Indiana, five of the plaintiffs were residents of Marion County.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.013" offset="1195447">The District Court found in favor of only one of the plaintiffs' from Marion County, only one plaintiff in this case was found by the District Court being entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.465" offset="1237243">That was Mason Bryant, Mason Bryant was the resident of an area, within Marion County, which the District Court denominated as the Center Township ghetto.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.973" offset="1287293">He was the resident and voter of the Center Township ghetto.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.250" offset="1300355">The Center Township is one of the nine townships of Marion County.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.363" offset="1320835">It's approximately in the center of the County, the other townships are ranged around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.839" offset="1338702">The Center Township ghetto is approximately the northern half of the Center Township.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.107" offset="1367751">The area designated by the Court as the ghetto is predominantly populated by Negroes who are poor and less well educated from the rest of the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.774" offset="1422503">I might point out that the term ghetto is the term used by the appellees and by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.889" offset="1450924">The area to which this refers is not regarded in the community as a ghetto, it's not called that in the community and to a certain extent it's non-descriptive of the area involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.650" offset="1518007">From the rest of the County, the District Court selected an area, Washington Township and compared the number of legislators who were residents of Washington Township to the member of legislators who were residents of the Center Township ghetto.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.577" offset="1601703">An absolute numbers are Washington Township had more Senators than the Center Township Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.335" offset="1632737">The Court computed ratios and found that Washington Township ratio was greater from the Center Township ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.436" offset="1673070">On this basis the District Court declared that the vote of the Center Township Negroes was diluted and canceled out by the Marion County multi-member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.765" offset="1746422">Rather than limited relief to merely sub-districting Marion County, the District Court ordered the reapportionment of the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.011" offset="1787382">Although, the Court appeared to rely upon a straight “one man, one vote” analysis of Reynolds, the true basis for requiring the reapportionment of the entire state was the testimony of John Banzhaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.672" offset="1862092">John Banzhaf is an Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University and has written some articles regarding multi-member districts and testified at this trial at the hearing to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.950" offset="1919143">He testified that apportionment plans providing for districts of different sizes, a mix system of multi-member districts and single member districts, created inherent inequities and was unconstitutional per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.902" offset="1979016">On this basis and on the basis of clerical considerations, political factors which the District Court found to exist within the County, the District Court required that when the state reapportioned that all districts be the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.356" offset="2040769">On July 28th the District Court declared the 1965 Apportionment Act unconstitutional as to the multi-member districting provisions relating to Marion County.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.019" offset="2107434">The District Court gave a stay till October 1 to reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.322" offset="2124675">The legislature was not in session at the time that the Act was declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.978" offset="2151320">We had at that time biennial sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.225" offset="2168247">The district or the legislature would not reconvene until January 1971, accordingly the State did not reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.308" offset="2212655">On October 15, the Court reconvened and invited plans from the parties, the plaintiffs, the defendants, intervening defendants, legislative leaders and interested parties in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.656" offset="2270020">On October 17, the District Court announced the minimum guidelines, the 1960 census data would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.734" offset="2298337">Single member districts would be preferred over multi-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.797" offset="2314533">Town, County and Township lines would be crossed when necessary, contrary to the provisions of the Indiana Constitution and that the District Court would take cognizance of the existence and location of the Center Township Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.533" offset="2385481">The plan adapted by the Court was the Court's plan supplemented by the plans submitted by the appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.747" offset="2438353">The appellees submitted a plan pertaining only to Marion County.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.142" offset="2463953">The Court's plans as adopted did rely on the 1960 census, did cross some county and township lines, did take cognizance of the existence and location of the Center Township Negro area.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.279" offset="2532498">It is interesting to note in this regard that one of the plans submitted by the intervening defendants had variances that were substantially the same as the variances in the plan provided by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.519" offset="2605432">The District Court rejected that plan because in its estimation it did not take cognizance of the Center Township Negro area.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.732" offset="2646288">On December 15, the District Court announced that its plan would be the plan, would be the apportionment scheme for the 1970 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.832" offset="2690696">It enjoined all state election officials permanently from enforcing the provisions of the 1965 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.725" offset="2726222">It mandated all state election officials to conduct the 1970 election in accordance with the Court's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.179" offset="2760077">Furthermore, the District Court retained jurisdiction, permanent jurisdiction apparently to pass on any future claims that the plaintiffs' might have regarding any future plan of apportionment which the legislature might draft, sort of a super legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.747" offset="2854327">The State of Indiana appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.337" offset="2860701">On January 6, the Governor moved the District Court to stay its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.283" offset="2888495">The District Court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.103" offset="2899780">The state on January 20 --</text>
            <text syncTime="701.737" offset="2910333">The next day, the Governor applied to this Court for a stay, the judgment of the District Court, and on February 2, this Court granted the Governor's application for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.007" offset="2959444">The 1970 election was conducted under the 1965 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.405" offset="2980968">This is the Act that was specifically submitted to the District Court in the second Stout case.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.010" offset="3007404">The District Court specifically approved the constitutionality of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.349" offset="3024750">The District Court in that case specifically found that the 1965 Act met the standards laid down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.805" offset="3070621">Turning to the first issue, the state submits that constitution does not in fact require racial, socioeconomic groups to be proportionally represented in the state legislature by representatives elected from that ethnic group.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.100" offset="3135822">The District Court's judgment in this case that the residents of the Center Township area --</text>
            <text syncTime="763.613" offset="3157870">That the vote of the residents of the Center Township area was canceled out, was based on two erroneous assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.243" offset="3184306">First, that the Center Township Negro area was proven on this record to exist as a distinct from cohesive area apart from the rest of the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.216" offset="3228191">The second erroneous assumption upon which the District Court based its judgment is that fewer legislative persons resided in the Center Township area, than in the Washington Township area, the adjoining area.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.569" offset="3345638">The primary holding in this case --</text>
            <text syncTime="812.327" offset="3352639">well, first of all you have the District Court's decision in 1965 which had already passed on the constitutionality of the 1965 Act under the “one man, one vote” principles of Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.891" offset="3406973">Now, along comes this case, about four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.540" offset="3425573">The Court looks at it and says, well, first of all this Court has changed the standards, secondly, we now have a new theory, the Banzhaf analysis that multi-member and single-member districts are inherently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.159" offset="3508015">The Court went from the finding that these defendants, these plaintiffs were invidiously discriminated against, it went from that finding to the conclusion that the entire state had to be reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.201" offset="3572172">It is just --</text>
            <text syncTime="868.266" offset="3576456">There is a complete gap in there as to why the whole state had to be reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.353" offset="3592756">The District Court specifically said that when once Marion County, it sub districted, there would be unallowable variances, but that's patently absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.360" offset="3644792">Either it was malapportioned --</text>
            <text syncTime="889.325" offset="3660675">well, you have legislators for persons in there, it's going to be the same after you reapportion as it was before, either it was okay before or it wasn't, but the District Court already said it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.539" offset="6329553">If it is -- if the decision of the District Court is allowed to stand, districts must be drawn to separate and segregate citizens on the basis of race, color, creed, economic conditions, and other special interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.038" offset="6379499">It wouldn't be unreasonable to carry that out a step further and if we are going to have ethnic or proportional representation, perhaps the next suit will be a suit against the State to increase the size of its legislature so that these interests can be represented with some degree of precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.771" offset="6454418">In the final analysis, I think what we're dealing with here is a special interest group.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.558" offset="6557654">Taken to its logical conclusion, the District Court would require that every special interest have its own representatives, may it be a lawyer's representative or a school representative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.996" offset="7063385">In conclusion with respect to this proportional representation issue, the designation of the Center Township Negro area implies the singling out on the basis of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.429" offset="7109047">You can't single this area out without looking at the race of the people living there, their economic condition and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.234" offset="7184280">You can't draw the lines around it -- around this group, unless you look at them and determine in advance before you draw those lines what is their race, what is their color, what is their creed, so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.883" offset="7242898">This Court has uniformly condemned all such attempts, and should do so in this case by reversing a decision on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.313" offset="7284590">The other issue I want to hit upon briefly is the Banzhaf issue, the striking down, finding all multi-member districts unconstitutional per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.556" offset="7345612">It has always been thought, it's been implied and accepted that although a voter in a multi-member district had an advantage because he had more representatives from which to --for whom to vote, that this advantage was offset by the fact that he was a part of the larger electorate competing with him to vote for these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.216" offset="7440280">This has been challenged by John Banzhaf and others. Banzhaf analysis briefly is that voters in the Marion County multi-member district were over-represented vis-à-vis smaller multi-member districts and single member-districts within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.170" offset="7504018">There was an inherent disparity and it was based on rather complex mathematical equations which he devised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.657" offset="7534007">It was on the basis of this that the Court required, the District Court required the State to reapportion the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.079" offset="7579669">The problem with Banzhaf's theory is that first of all as it relates to this case, no independent study was made of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.465" offset="7613210">The figures and maps, exhibits, and so on and so forth used by Banzhaf in this case where those supplied to him by the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.149" offset="13395989">Yes, they want to set up rules in advance so that different groups could participate for both plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.210" offset="13420231">They needed a rule such that a comparison could be made between plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.162" offset="13436008">So they made a least political decision, just said, well all single-member districts and we'll take the plan that's best that has the least population deviation which is what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.688" offset="13486164">The population deviation turned out to be less than 1% throughout the state, and that was the purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.296" offset="13512600">And I would like to turn immediately to the question of uniform districts and why we believe they are constitutionally required in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.189" offset="13552097">There was a very strong presentation in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.481" offset="13565262">It was un-contradicted and both sides affirmatively presented affirmative proof that when they are in the Indiana general assembly, multi-member district delegation, at least that went from Marion County vote in bluff at the behest of the party organization and that they do not vote on their own, and there was very few matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.668" offset="13662020">It also was proven that they are elected in bluff that during the past 40 years, only twice has a member of a party which lost generally in an election been elected to the Indiana general assembly from Marion County, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.774" offset="13738506">During the other elections, with those two exceptions, either one party slate or the other was elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.691" offset="13766092">The evidence also showed that there during all primary elections in recent memory, the official party organization slate was nominated to run for the Indiana general assembly and persons not supported by the organization slate, were not nominated in such primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.731" offset="13854281">The evidence also showed that those persons who became, on the organization slate were throughly controlled by the central committee of the party organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.943" offset="13907153">And so in effect, this multi-membered district delegation which is and has historically been elected from Marion County is a unit rule delegation controlled at one source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.709" offset="13962219">This has two results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.212" offset="13968175">This demonstrates that parochial interest such as those of a ghetto area could not realistically be represented, and Pat Chavis, the plaintiff who had been the sole black senator in the Indiana general assembly during the past 10 years, represented that he could not effectively represent his people because he had to do in each vote what his county chairman wanted him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.421" offset="14065037">And we presented evidence showing what present and past members have done on role call, voting constantly in bluff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.808" offset="14102653">This is pertinent to the dilution of black people and the ghetto area of Marion County, Indiana and is also pertinent to the district court's finding that multi-member districts of different size can be inherently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.080" offset="14167646">What – what it amounted to was that the proof showed that the multi-membered district allegations are the same as if you have weighted voting because they voted as one in Marion County, it's the same as having one representative with 15 votes, and one from Lake County with 11.</text>
