            <text syncTime="20.649" offset="185971">Under the Colorado Water Rights Determination and Administration Act of 1969, the 70 water districts were replaced with 7 water divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.937" offset="239156">Water Division 5 includes the area drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries, excluding the Gunnison River and this includes the former Water District 37 and Eagle River Watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.289" offset="300492">In February of last year, the Attorney General received by mail a paper signed by the water clerk of the Water Division 5, directed that all persons interested in water applications in said division, supplying a list of water right applications filed in that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.277" offset="360469">The paper concluded with the statement that the recipient had until the last day of March, 1970, that was the month thereafter that preceded the notice, to file with the water clerk a verified statement of opposition to any such application.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.731" offset="422327">Similar notices had been received by the Attorney General listing water rights applications filed during each month thereafter in Water Division 5 and in Water Division 4 and 6 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.947" offset="471124">The response to the 1969 -- December 1969 notice, the United States filed a motion to quash, this was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.689" offset="506128">The writ was applied for the Colorado Supreme Court which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.463" offset="529220">As in the Eagle County case affected by the proceedings in Water Division 5 or Federal Water Rights of two types, property rights acquired in the state law and reserved another rights based on federal law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kiechel</label>
            <text syncTime="295.846" offset="1286771">They said that by admitting Colorado into the union with a constitutional provision -- state constitutional provision that said that all rights of the water of the State of Colorado were property of the people and subject to appropriation under state law that the United States is precluded from asserting a claim of reserve rights within Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.658" offset="1405994">Our response to that, if Your Honor please is that the enabling statute required in Section 4 that the people of the territory of Colorado recognize and disclaim any right to the public lands within that territory and recognize that that was a matter for the sole and exclusive disposition of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.018" offset="1515395">This was a specific provision of the Enabling Act and that Act was -- and that provision was referred to once again, when the President proclaimed in his Presidential Proclamation after the Colorado constitution was adopted that the Colorado was a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.534" offset="1605465">So that we say by the provision of the Enabling Act, Congress reserved to itself for the right disposed of public lands, except for the school land which were granted to the territory and certain other lands and specified amount for public buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.750" offset="1678399">And we say there in furtherance of that, that thereafter when the United States reserved from the public domain for a specified purpose lands, it reserved as well the appurtenant water rights to fulfill the purposes of that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.035" offset="1755512">And that carries with it the priority of the date of the creation of the reservations subject and I wish to point out, subject to rights vested at the time of its creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.648" offset="1821968">The matter of the legislative history, I would discuss Mr. Justice Harlan asked if there were some specific episode which triggered off the enactment of that statute, and I think that Mr. Balcomb has referred to the specific episode which did.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.922" offset="1907022">It was a proceeding in the home state of Senator McCarran, the sponsor of the Act in Nevada on the Quinn River, and it involved a suit for administration of water rights already having been adjudicated under a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.205" offset="1988211">And there, the United States had purchased, had acquired by purchase, certain water rights on the Quinn River and this is the primary concern of Senator McCarran.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.725" offset="2054248">This is demonstrated by his statements on the floor of the Senate, the fact that the -- he says it’s -- to allow the United States in its own right whereas a trustee, those were acquired for Indian purposes, to have a better right than the former owner is not fair and just as to the other water users on the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.893" offset="2150902">And of course, the terms of the statute as been pointed out refers to appropriation under state law, and in an appropriative right states such as Nevada or Colorado, the state here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.907" offset="2198967">The only way a private citizen can acquire a water right is by application of the water to a beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.004" offset="2223417">That water right becomes fixed in amount in quality by that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.235" offset="2248286">Another characteristic of an appropriative right is that it is subject to loss through abandonment or non use.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.035" offset="2275558">Now, concerning the legal characteristics of an appropriative right, the second sentence of the McCarran Act which I would refer the Court’s attention to is consistent with the first, only if the consent to sue was restricted to rights acquired under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.084" offset="2339715">And second sentence of the McCarran Amendment says, the United States, when a party to any such suit, one shall be deemed to a waive any right to plead state laws are inapplicable, or that the United States is not amenable, there too by reason of its sovereignty and too shall be subject to the judgments, orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof in the same manner into the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.966" offset="2631241">And it was that type of right which the United States had acquired in this Quinn River situation that Senator McCarran was concerned about being subject to adjudication or in that case, administration by the state court of Nevada.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kiechel</label>
            <text syncTime="684.539" offset="2841579">Yes indeed, and it was until Arizona v. California that it was extended to other federal reservations, but the concept of a right other than an appropriative right, a right rising by creation of a federal reservation was well known in the water law of the west at the time of the enactment of the McCarran amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.573" offset="2933635">Now, with keeping in mind the intent of the sponsor that is Senator McCarran to said be equally that federal government and private citizens to adjudication of water rights acquired under the state law, and the express terms of the statute designed to carry out that intent in sharp distinction and contrast are reserve rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.764" offset="3030392">The reserve rights as I’ve said arise by creation of the reservation automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.438" offset="3053171">They don’t require the application of water to use, priority states from the date that they withdraw and applies to future as well as existing use.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.895" offset="3094967">And the -- in summary with respect to the legislative intent, I’d say that there being no expressed provision in the terms of the statute, including reserve rights, nor any specific intent by the sponsor of the amendment, it follows that it was not within the contemplation of Congress that they be included in this state court adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.890" offset="5318928">But the last day of the second month following the month in which the application was filed and the water referee of Water Division 5 or the water division, then without conducting a formal hearing investigates the truth of the application and the opposition and within the month, following the month in which the oppositions are filed, rules on the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.317" offset="5404609">This is mailed by the water clerk to all persons who file either a statement or an opposition and it becomes affective upon entry subject only to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.240" offset="5448286">So that the statute notices only those parties who are interested in the applications filed in a particular month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.882" offset="5474931">The only water rights before the water referee are those who which an application is been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.540" offset="5497501">The only parties are those who’ve taken affirmative action to be heard and so that, even though the referee’s procedures are extremely limited and involve only a part of the water rights and the parties in the water division, the burden on the United States I submit is tremendous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.819" offset="5810657">I think one of the most interesting and novel thing about the second case is the -- now, we say that they are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.779" offset="5838451">I think I can establish that the procedures involved in adjudication under the old and the new law are identical is that the presence or absence of a judgment below that is in opinion that can be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.952" offset="5899160">I don’t believe that it’s Judge Darrel’s opinion to which I will refer later on, the trial judge that is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.974" offset="5923297">I just believe it is Mr. Justice Grows’ opinion in 87 that is probably the subject matter of the discussion here likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.997" offset="5967391">It’s interesting to note that under the old statute, the primary objection to the Government to being bound by the proceedings for at least, there stay adjudicated -- adjudicatory rights related to the size of the stream system or source of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.230" offset="6040325">And this oddly enough is a situation which is never bothered them when they wanted to be plaintiff, but now only bothers them when they do not wish to articulate and do not wish to quantify their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.034" offset="6087555">There are several circumstances that I know of where the United States is come in, I can point to the ones, two in Nevada, one of which was before this Court on the separate point that we could go yesterday to the extent that certiorari was denied, that was the Carson River case in Nevada.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.313" offset="6164668">They, about the time that United States decided that did not want to subject themselves to state adjudicating procedures, there was pending in the District Court for Summit County, located at Breckenridge, two parallel adjudication procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.925" offset="6235094">One, to adjudicate rights for irrigation and another one to adjudicate rights other than the irrigation, under the statute which preceded the 1943 Act which brought those two times the things all into one action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.626" offset="6285876">And though the Colorado Supreme Court ultimately held that the Government had made a voluntary appearance in those proceedings and could thereby be bound, the United States selected to bring an action which for this lack of anything better to call it in the nature of the quiet title action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.265" offset="6344391">In other words, a suit in equity to determine the Government’s rights to a reclamation project, the Colorado Big Thompson Project which had not by them, then completely submitted to the court of Breckenridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.160" offset="6399979">Now, the Blue River is a little bit larger than the Eagle River, but it’s the same kind of a system and it ends up by running into the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.048" offset="6439581">That would not have been even under their definition, a general adjudication because they were very choosy about who they joined, joining the conservancy district, the involve Northern Colorado, City and County of Denver, Colorado Springs and everyone else who got into that action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.884" offset="6554937">Oddly enough the way it became a general proceeding was that the United States removed the then pending adjudication procedures from the Breckenridge courts, District Court and Summit County and thereby brought in our view everybody on the Colorado River, even though it was said to be supplemental then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.572" offset="6629648">It was a supplemental general adjudication pending in Summit County, they brought in the federal court and they thereby joined the users of the entire river and I’m satisfied they consider that they have decrees for the Green Mountain Reservoir, the Colorado Big Thompson collection systems and the right to transport this water through the mountains.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.308" offset="11224586">And they have picked the word general out of the opinions of this Court and opinions of other courts and said they don’t have a general proceeding there because they do not have everyone before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.054" offset="11263561">And the reason, if it please the Court, that everyone is not before them is because United States will not join.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.937" offset="11287071">There the one party, these adjudication procedures in Colorado and the other states that keeps it from being a general adjudication, and that keeps the certainty of water rights out of the law entirely because as they indicate, we have these large areas as shown on the map that we're entitled to use water in certain ways, but we want to keep it a secret until such time as we decide to put it to work and in the meantime, no one else can do anything with the water at all with any certainty.</text>
