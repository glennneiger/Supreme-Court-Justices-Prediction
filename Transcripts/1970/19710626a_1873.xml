            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="110.611" offset="546858">The items filed by the Post and the Times, I do not believe are marked top secret, but they are marked in-camera in the caption of the items.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.040" offset="604536">I repeat, all three have also filed regular briefs except not printed, only the American Civil Liberties Union seem to have the resources to produce a printed brief for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.838" offset="687710">I am told that the law students of today are indignantly opposed to final examinations because they say that no lawyer has asked to work under such pressure that he as to get things out in three or four hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.433" offset="774123">I can only say that I think it’s perhaps fortunate that Mr. Glendon and Mr. Bickel and I went to law school under earlier dispensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.485" offset="830339">It is important I think to get this case in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="864402">The case of course raises important and difficult problems about the constitutional right of free speech and of the free press and we’ve heard much about that from the press in the last two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.629" offset="942874">But it also raises important questions of the equally fundamental and important right of the government to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.923" offset="996059">Great emphasis has been put on the First Amendment and rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.014" offset="1028451">But there is also involved here a fundamental question of separation of powers in the sense of the power and authority which the Constitution allocates to the President as Chief Executive and as Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy and involved in that, there is also the question of the integrity of the institution of the presidency whether that institution, one of the three great powers under the separation of powers, can function effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.981" offset="1228340">The problem lies on a wide spectrum and like all questions of constitutional law, involves the resolution of competing principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.606" offset="1298871">In the first place it seems to me that it will be helpful to make some preliminary observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.884" offset="1347981">If we start out with the assumption that never under any circumstances can the press be subjected to prior restraints, never under any circumstances can the press be enjoined from publications, of course, we come out with the conclusion that there can be no injunction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.111" offset="1452889">But I suggest, not as necessarily conclusive in this case, but I suggest that there is no such constitutional rule and never has been such a constitutional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.724" offset="1515269">We have for example the copyright laws and my son was in trial earlier this week and he sent me copies of the Globe &amp; Mail of Toronto, ten series of the story that Pentagon is trying to kill, each one added copyright New York Times service.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.910" offset="1628014">I have no objection to that, but I -- these stories which had then published have been copyrighted by the New York Times and I believe by the portion imposed and I have no doubt that perhaps in other cases because these have already attracted much attention, the New York Times and the Washington Post would seek to enforce their copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.429" offset="1750162">I suppose it is very likely that in one form or another, they have obtained royalties because of their copyright on this matter, but let us also consider other fields of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.131" offset="1852876">There is a well known branch of the law that goes under the heading of “Literary Property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="446.556" offset="1890597">In the Court of Appeals, I gave the example of a manuscript written by Earnest Hemingway, let’s assume while he is still living, unpublished, perhaps incomplete, subject to revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.292" offset="1957575">In some way the press gets hold of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.883" offset="1975965">Perhaps it’s stolen, perhaps it’s bought from a secretary through breech of fiduciary responsibility or perhaps it’s filed on the segue and if the New York Times sought to print that, I have no doubt that Mr. Hemingway or now his heirs next to kin, could obtain from the Courts an injunction against the press printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.410" offset="2126012">Only this morning, I see in the paper that a New York Publisher is bringing a suit against Newsday, a New York news paper because Newsday has violated what the New York publisher consists says considers to be it’s copyright in the forthcoming memoirs of President Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.471" offset="2230293">And then finally or not finally, but next, we have a whole series of law, a traditional branch of equity, involving participation and the breech of trust and there cannot be the slightest doubt, it seems to me, that no matter what the motive, no matter what the justification that both the New York Times and the Washington post are here consciously, intentionally participating in a breech of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.281" offset="2373548">They know that this material is not theirs, they do not own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.383" offset="2401970">I’m not talking about the pieces of paper of which they may have acquired by the literary property and again I say I don’t regard this as controlling or conclusive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.297" offset="2481591">I’m simply trying to advance the proposition that there are many factors and many facets here and that there is no constitutional rule that there can never be prior restraints on the press or on free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.902" offset="2555988">Now in our main brief in this case, we have which I may say was largely prepared by my associate Mr. Friedman, last evening and last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.021" offset="2620458">We have cited one case which comes very close to being a injunction by this Court against publications in the press and that is the Associated Press case in I believe 215 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.791" offset="2711573">The Associated Press is a cooperative of newspapers and there, the Associated Press sought and obtained an injunction against the dissemination of news by its competitor United or International Press in that case not United by its competitor International and that was granted on copyright and related grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.088" offset="2828706">But we have other areas in the law where this Court has approved against specific First Amendment claims, injunctions in advance forbidding speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.473" offset="2898296">One area of this is the labor law field where as recently is 395 U.S. in Sinclair against the National Labor Relations Board, the Court unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, enforcing the Board's order which included a provision requiring Sinclair to cease and desist from the threatening the employees with the possible closing of the plant or the transfer of the weaving production with the attendant loss of employment or with any other economic reprisals, if they were to select the above named or any other labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.319" offset="3109679">In 393 U.S, a case involving the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Trade Commission against the Tex -- against Texaco Inc., involving orders with respect to TBA, tires, battery and accessories, the Court approved the order of the Federal Trade Commission which restrained Texaco from using or attempting to use any device such as, but not limited to, dealer discussions, they were ordered not to speak to dealers about this subject and the First Amendment was specifically referred to in the brief for the respondent and was not mentioned in this Court’s opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="807.371" offset="3333914">Mr. Solicitor General, of course, as the Times Film case as well and there are no doubt others.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.753" offset="3351364">I didn’t understand, however, that your brother counsel on the other side really questioned any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.360" offset="3385846">I thought that at least for purposes of this case, they conceded that an injunction would be not violative of the First Amendment or put it this way that despite the First Amendment, an injunction would be permissible, in this case if the disclosure of this material would in fact oppose a grave and immediate danger to the security of United States, that is that for purposes of this case, they’ve concede that, but they have said that in fact the disclosure of this material would not pose any such grave and immediate danger.

            <text syncTime="944.475" offset="3882277">Now with respect to the actual factual situations, the only thing that I can do is to point to the closed brief, which I have filed in which there are ten specific items referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.239" offset="3953330">Now when I say specific items, I must be -- I must make myself very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.296" offset="3973601">Some of those are collective.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.967" offset="3984259">There are -- I have brought here, you perhaps can’t see them, the 47 volumes that are supposed to be the background of this, they are included in the record of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which has been filed with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.970" offset="4068268">Let me say when we move on to this next item that it was inevitable that I delegate the question of preparing the supplemental statement which was covered by this Court’s order yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.462" offset="4142247">This Court, as did the Second Circuit, referred to the material specified in the special appendix in the Second Circuit and to such additional items as might be included on a supplemental statement filed at 5:00 pm yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.516" offset="4214450">I had nothing to do with preparing that supplemental statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.133" offset="4488944">Part of the problem here is that a great mass of this material is not included in the 47 volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.949" offset="4520187">It is a background material, earlier drafts of some papers which are materially different than what is included in the 47 volumes and as a result, we cannot tell from the inventory what is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.036" offset="4588523">For example, one of the items already published which has caused a certain amount of controversy, publicly and internationally, is a telegram to the Canadian Government, that is not in the 47 volumes and is not referred to in the 47 volumes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.466" offset="10026277">Well I think Mr. Justice that is true, but I also think the heart of our case is that the publication of the material specified in my closed brief will as I have tried to argue there, materially affect the Security of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.123" offset="10100882">It will affect lives, it will affect the process of determination of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.753" offset="10123452">It will affect the process of recovering prisoners of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.432" offset="10142156">I cannot say that determination of the war or recovering prisoners of war is something which has an immediate effect on the Security of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.659" offset="10186982">I say that it has such an effect on the Security of United States that it ought to be the basis of an injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.085" offset="10220732">Now, I would like to get to the question of the standard which was used by the District Judge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.073" offset="10252706">I think it is relevant to point out that on page 267 of the closed -- of the transcript in the District Court before Judge Gesell, he said, “the Court further finds that publication of the documents in the large may interfere with the ability of the department under the state in the conduct of delicate negotiations now in process, not in the past, now in process or contemplated for the future whether this negotiations involve Southeast Asia or other areas of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.248" offset="10437339">This is not so much because of anything in the documents themselves, but rather results from the fact that it will appear to foreign Governments that this Government is unable to prevent publication of actual Government communications when a leak such as the present one occurs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.925" offset="10512050">Now, thus the judge rejected as a standard in this matter the whole question of the ability of the department of state and that means the President to whom the foreign relations are conferred by the Constitution to conduct delicate negotiations, now in process are contemplated for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.687" offset="10599194">And I suggest to the Court that it is perfectly obvious that the conduct of delicate negotiations now in process are contemplated for the future has an impact on the Security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.855" offset="10659798">Now, the standard which the judge did apply is one which -- with the benefit of -- with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I would have written differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.547" offset="10750600">Executive order 10501 provides the basis for security classification issued by President Eisenhower in 1953 after a comprehensive study by a commission on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.502" offset="10830430">And the definition of top secret in Section 1 (a) of Executive Order 10501 is, “top secret shall be authorized by appropriate authority only for defense information or material which requires the highest degree of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.544" offset="10906603">The top secret classification shall be applied only to that information or material that the defense aspect of which is paramount and the unauthorized disclosure of which could result in exceptionally grave damage to the nation such as,” now this was not intended to be all inclusive, it is illustrative, “such as leading to a definite break in diplomatic relations, affecting the defense of the United States, an armed against the United States or its allies, a war or the compromise of military or defense plans or intelligence operations or scientific or technological developments vital to the national defense” and what Judge Gesell has -- he had -- Judge Gesell has used that as the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.875" offset="11107850">He made no reference whatever to the succeeding classification which is secret and there is also a classification which is confidential, but Judge Gesell has used as the basis of his decision and I suggest this was fundamental error that there is no proof, this is on page 269 of the transcript of the hearing before Judge Gesell, there is no proof that there will be a definite break in diplomatic relations, that there will be an armed attack on the United States, that there will be an armed attack on an ally, that there will be a war, that there will a compromise of military or defense plans and I in my closed brief, I contend that he was wrong on that, a compromise of intelligence operations and then my closed brief, I contend that he was plainly wrong on that or a compromise of scientific and technological materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.754" offset="11347446">And if the standard is that we cannot prevent the publication of improperly acquired material unless we can show in substance in effect because that’s what he really meant that there will be a break in diplomatic relations or that there will be an arm detect on the United States, I suggest that the standard which Judge Gesell used is far too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.362" offset="11449846">Now perhaps it lies in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.541" offset="11462593">My own thought would be that in the present (Inaudible) state of the world, considering negotiations in the Middle East, considering the SALT talks now going on and it's perhaps not inappropriate to remember that SALT is Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the consequences of which obviously have in all likelihood not the prevention of a nuclear attack tomorrow, maybe not next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.572" offset="11602714">But only by a success in this kind of negation, can we have any hope that our children and our children’s children will have a world to live in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.482" offset="11654332">I suggest that when it is found by the District Court that the publication of the documents in the large may interfere with the ability of the Department of State in the conduct of delicate negotiations now in process are contemplated for the future, that should be enough by itself to warrant a restraint on the publication of the now quite narrowly selected group of materials covered in the special appendix and dealt with in some detail in my closed brief and the related papers which had been filed with the Court this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.836" offset="12631730">I point out now only that as was evident to us at the hearings when we cross examined some of Government witnesses, high ranking people in the Government quite evidently read these things on Sunday morning, the following day and no great alarm sounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.879" offset="12715948">I meant to return to the significance of this point if I could see it, I mentioned it by the way now only in the process of reciting the chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.377" offset="12753878">We were then enjoined under prior restraint on the 15 and we have been under injunction ever since, the 11th I guess under the order of the Court of Appeals to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.405" offset="12818035">We would remain under injunction presumably to the July 3 with the distinct possibility of more time added after that if appellate proceedings are required.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.186" offset="12901104">It took place on Friday last I believe, started first thing in the morning with open hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.627" offset="12934855">We went in-camera as Mr. Seymour said for something upward of four hours, I don’t know the exact time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.309" offset="12965679">The record will clearly show that the judges’ sole purpose in-camera and continuously expressed intent was to provoke from the Government witnesses something specific to achieve from them the degree of guidance that he felt he needed in order to penetrate this enormous record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.366" offset="13057839">It is our judgment and it was his that he got very little perhaps almost nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.182" offset="13085111">The point however that I wish to leave with you is that at no time in the course of these hearings, did the Government object to their, what is now called the speed or rapidity of them, at not point it was more time as for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.750" offset="13163374">Of course we all labored as I think is only proper under the knowledge that a great newspaper was being restrained from publishing and that expedition was desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.576" offset="13214678">But there is no evidence that I know off that Judge Gurfein rushed the proceedings or would have rushed them if the Government had asked for more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.537" offset="13254593">I think the Government gave Judge Gurfein all it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.945" offset="13276223">Now the Government based it’s complaints against us framed in very general terms on a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.912" offset="13304017">First one section of it, finally Section 793 (e) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.571" offset="13326691">We have a substantial portion of our brief that is still devoted to arguing that that statute is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.479" offset="13358352">Judge Gurfein so held it to be and I take it that the order of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is at least open to the interpretation that that holding of Judge Gurfein's is not affirmed at any rate accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.848" offset="13423762">If I may at this point take up Mr. Justice Stewart’s question to the Solicitor General, referring to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.038" offset="13460543">We concede, we have all along in this case conceded for purposes of the argument, that the prohibition against prior restraint like (Inaudible) constitution is not an absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.232" offset="13517281">But beyond that Mr. Justice, our position is a little more complicated than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.370" offset="13541836">Nor do we really think that the case even with the statute out of it is a simple, presents indeed a simple question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.967" offset="13584259">Rather, our position is two-fold. First on principles as we view them with the separation of powers which we believe denied the existence of inherent presidential authority on which an injunction can be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.433" offset="13662104">First on those and secondly on First Amendment principles which are interconnected on both the end which involved the question of a standard before one reaches the facts, it’s a standard on which we deeper greatly from the Solicitor General, on both these grounds, we believe that the only proper resolution of the case is the dismissal of complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.549" offset="13882577">The reason for that being that a Court has to find its law somewhere, as Holmes would have said I suppose of -- some legislative will must be present from which the Court draws the law that it can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.717" offset="13931269">Then that legislative will has to be the President's, if there is no statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.484" offset="13946316">Now, I don’t for a moment argue that the President doesn’t have full inherent power to establish a system of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.990" offset="13992396">That he doesn’t have the fullest inherent power to administer that system and its procedures within the executive branch he has his means of guarding security at the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.441" offset="14054149">In some measure, he is aided by the criminal sanction, but anyway he has full inherent power and the scope of judicial review of the exercise of that power will presumably vary with the case in which it comes up, but I’m prepared to concede the decision in the Epstein (ph) for example which is cited I think in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.785" offset="14135547">Briefs that under the Freedom of Information Act, the scope of review is limited, limited to examining whether it is (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.401" offset="14161983">Nor do I argue the -- that the President doesn’t have standing in the sense in which Baker and Karr distinguishes between standing and justiceability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.369" offset="14201898">Standing to come into Court which is I think the burden of most of the cases that the Government cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.638" offset="14226975">The question that I do argue is whether there is inherent presidential power to make substantive law not for the internal government of -- internal management of the government, but out going -- out looking substantive law which can form the basis for a judicially issued injunction imposing a prior restraint on speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.147" offset="14324987">The decisive issue that ties in at this point and our ultimate First Amendment point is of course the exception carved out by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota for those -- that narrow area in which he accepted that a prior restraint on speech might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.658" offset="14422998">This is an exception that is made to a rule more solidly entrenched in the First Amendment and any other aspects of it or rule that is deeply part of the formative experience out of which the First Amendment came, the rule against the prior restraint, based on the experience that prior restraints fall on speech with a special brutality and finality and procedural ease of all their own which distinguishes them from other regulations of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.001" offset="14560402">If a criminal statute chose speech, a prior restraint freezes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.097" offset="14580778">It’s within that well established doctrine that the exception arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.377" offset="14605855">Now, as Chief Justice Hughes formulated it, it referred to, he actually said, “we would all assume that a prior restraint might be possible to prevent actual obstruction of the recruiting service, this is the Chief Justice language, or the publication of sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.769" offset="14703449">I suppose that under present law, the recruiting service part of that exception is problematic, but on the sailing dates of ships and the location of troops, there is a very specific statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.052" offset="14756634">It is 18 U.S.C. 794 which isn't cited -- hasn’t been cited against us which again applicable which is why it hasn’t been cited against us because that’s not what we report, that’s not -- that isn’t in our papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.322" offset="14829672">Now, that being the case, there is no applicable statute under which we are covered and the question arises as a matter of inherent presidential authority, what kind of feared event would give rise to an independent power on the part of the President?</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.318" offset="14913682">It’s the question of in a sense that was saved in Hirabayashi versus United States, the first of the Japanese exclusion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.424" offset="14946074">And it’s a question which in its own context of course, Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company v. Sawyer answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.069" offset="14988706">Now, my suggestion would be that whatever that case, that extremity, absolute other extremity in which action to save for the public safely is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.388" offset="15049937">Whatever that case maybe in which under this Constitution under its rules of separation of powers, the President has independent inherent authority to act domestically against citizens, let alone to impose a prior restraint, whatever that case maybe, it cannot be this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.743" offset="15119318">Whatever that case maybe, it sure is a magnitude of an obviousness that would lead to the eye and that’s why in part Mr. Chief Justice, I mentioned at the beginning the period of time that has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.077" offset="15200716">I would suppose that stretching our imagination and trying to envision that case, the one characteristic of it, suggested indeed by the example of Chief Justice Hughes recited, suggested by the phrase that the Second Circuit used which is probably why the Solicitor General resists the word immediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.313" offset="15297682">The Single characteristic that we can surely, immediately see of such an imagined event, would be that it’s obvious, that the public safety is in issue, the time of the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.812" offset="15371661">I submit that that cannot be this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.848" offset="15391828">It cannot be that it has taken, that it has to take the Government which has been reviewing this documents for many months, not just in connection with this case but in reply to an inquiry made by Senator Fulbright is the record of our hearings in New York shows, it cannot be that a Government consisting after all of more than just the three witnesses, five witness that we heard in New York or the ones that were heard here, over this length of time has an unfamiliar -- unfamiliarity with these documents, substantially they might be which is so great that when news of their publication comes up, no body in the Government knows that somewhere in those documents is one which presents a mortal danger to the Security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.412" offset="15594015">And I would submit secondly that while error is always possible, judge Griffin and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed them on the record that he had before him and Judge Gesell in the Court of Appeals here, all those judges can't have been that wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="4699.541" offset="18902580">I can only say that unless which I can imagine can be possible, the link of causation is made direct and immediate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4725.459" offset="19006234">There are 17 causes feeding into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.315" offset="19021699">Three of those are -- anyone of those other than the publication is entirely capable of being the single effective cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4881.527" offset="19630456">Professor Bickel, I have one question that’s prompted by this exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.456" offset="19658250">Generally speaking, there are, as I understand it, no statute is granting immunity to newspaper reporters from disclosing their sources, but there is a firm claim made by newspapers, by reporters and there have been a number of cases on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.113" offset="19720840">If I read the briefs and the accounts of those other cases in California and several other places, claim of the newspaper is that the First Amendment protects them from revealing their source even to a grand jury in the investigation of criminal matters because otherwise, the newspaper sources would dry up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.439" offset="19810179">Now, that’s generally the thesis of the press, is it not?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Alexander M. Bickel</label>
            <text syncTime="4930.980" offset="19828360">Well, there are some cases that are on this Court’s docket as you know Mr. Chief Justice for next fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.526" offset="19850512">One of them with which I’m most familiar is the Caldwell case from California in which there was a refusal to reveal sources upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit even to the point of not requiring an appearance before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.188" offset="19917176">But the claim is very substantially qualified, that is to say Caldwell holds, one doesn’t know how far that might be taken and perhaps some of the other cases will require the argument to take it somewhat farther, but Caldwell on its own holds that in circumstances where the Government, as indeed Attorney General Mitchell’s regulations themselves provided, which are issued after the Caldwell case started.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.537" offset="20026577">In cases where the Government hasn’t shown a clear necessity for the evidence, hasn’t shown that it hasn’t been able to get it elsewhere, hasn’t show that it’s central, inescapably central to the proof of whatever crime it is that the grand jury is investigating that in those circumstances where the claim of confidential communication is made by the reporter, there is a sufficient First Amendment interest to protect that claim on the theory that if confidential sources dry up and they -- the theory runs would dry up because there were no protection of confidentiality, there would be a diminished flow of news.</text>

            <text syncTime="5018.338" offset="20177774">Yes, but the argument then is that the newspapers, newspaper reporters claim for themselves a right which this argument now would deny to the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="5026.982" offset="20212360">Mr. Chief Justice, I know there is an appearance of unfairness or unevenness about it, but I think the answer that a reporter would make and an answer that I find wholly persuasive is that neither in this case nor in a case like Caldwell does the New York Times or does a reporter claim something for himself, but rather that the claim is made in order to vindicate the First Amendment and those interests which that great document serves.</text>

            <text syncTime="5099.881" offset="20503886">Because, I think we have heard here a familiar plea, familiar to what has been involved in this case over this last intense week that some more time is needed while the First Amendment is suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.867" offset="20571909">We first face this question, Judge Gesell did some week ago and after a hearing on the temporary restraining order, unconvinced by the generality and lack of specificity, he denied the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.058" offset="20660621">The Government has a course with its right promptly went up to the Court of Appeals and in an extraordinary late session, everything has been -- everything has been late I may say in this case, late hours, the Court of Appeals two to one judges Rob and Judge Robinson granted a temporary restraining order to the Government to give them some time and thus for the second time in two weeks and the second time in 200 years, the United States succeeded in obtaining a temp -- prior restraint against the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.714" offset="20815266">Now, the Court of Appeals stated -- the Court of Appeals stated -- in its order that it would set -- send it back, send it to the District Court and the District Court would try it to determine whether the granting of an injunction with a publication of material would so prejudice the defense interest of the United States are a result in such irreparable injury to the United States as to justify the extraordinary relief that was asked to it, a prior restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="5419.696" offset="21783155">Two fine District Court Judges, two fine Court of Appeals have considered this and in each I think it’s fair to say even in the New York case, the Government did not meet its burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.202" offset="21833206">And so it says to us, but one more time, just one more time and this is where I was a moment ago when I said that Judge Rob and Judge Robinson agreed to give them a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.113" offset="21884824">Now we had a hearing in the District of Columbia and I like to, if I may, comment upon what the Government said and it said it twice about that hearing because really Your Honors are being asked to -- on a representation and it's a I know a sincere representation by General Griswold, but on a representation if we are given some more time, maybe we can find something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.209" offset="21981268">But here is what the Government says in its brief and it said it again yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.752" offset="21995374">They said in New York, the Government was not able to present to the Court all of the evidence relating to the impact of the disclosure of this material upon foreign relations and national defense that it was able to present to the District Court in the Washington Post case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.680" offset="22067158">We had and the Government was accorded the fullest hearing that it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.924" offset="22092131">We had -- we started at the unusual hour of 8:00 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.054" offset="22112611">The Government’s case proceed it through the luncheon hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.717" offset="22127240">We cross examined as we thought it was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.350" offset="22141764">The Court had plenty of time to consider the matter he delivered, I think you agree, whether you agree with this result, a finely reasoned opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.803" offset="22175619">So there was no rush and no pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.735" offset="22187321">Then the matter went up to the Court of Appeals and there and the Court of Appeals had a session some three hours the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.045" offset="22216579">And I might say too and I think this is perhaps important, there’s been no restriction on the Government's latitude because they did have this in-camera hearings which frankly was very difficult from our point of view to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.044" offset="22264539">But they did have them and they had it in-camera hearing in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.513" offset="22282407">So to say now that we need more time, I think does not measured up to the other side, the other side of the equation which you're being asked to do and that is to restrain two newspapers while others are publishing from giving their readers the news.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.175" offset="22353147">And it is of course their readers that we feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.317" offset="22369656">I think properly their rights are involved too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5568.514" offset="22378433">Their right to know and I’m talking about currency and immediacy there is now involved in this country, the country is on gage and in intense national debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.362" offset="22421797">Things are happening this week on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.791" offset="22431514">These lawsuits undoubtedly precipitated the executive to turn over these documents to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.913" offset="22464010">Now Senator Fulbright as I’m sure you’re all aware have been trying for some two years I understand to get these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.264" offset="22497447">And I think it’s of interest here because we're dealing with this case and these documents and I think classification is important here in your consideration of these cases because these documents were classified top secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.039" offset="22552513">Now they were classified top secret because some unknown individual was not presented to the Court whose subjective judgment couldn’t be explored despite the district judge asking that he’s be brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.637" offset="22602982">Perhaps it was a good reason, we don’t know, decided that they were top secret, they were all top secret because one was top secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.012" offset="22640494">There had been no review of these documents except for a one individual who said that he had been reviewing them for some two years for sensitivity and the sensitivity arose from Senator Fulbright's frequent request to get these documents so the Congress could make the laws and perhaps the public would be informed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6890.765" offset="27667498">I should like to make it plain that we are not at all concerned with past events in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.981" offset="27708353">We are not interested in protecting anybody, that should be obvious enough simply from the date of the materials which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6913.340" offset="27757777">We are concerned with the present and future impact of the publication of some of this material and when I say future, I don’t mean in the 21st Century, but I also don't mean to limit it to tomorrow because in this area, events of great consequence to the United States happen over periods of six months, a year, perhaps two or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.106" offset="27864775">What we are concerned with is the impact on the present and the reasonably near future of the publication of these events, of these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.145" offset="27917019">Now it is perfectly true that prior restraint cases with respect to the press are rare or conceivably nonexistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="6967.168" offset="27973026">I hadn’t had time to make a really thorough research.</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.368" offset="27993819">I did point out that there are prior restraint cases as recently as last term with respect to freedom of speech which is the First Amendment in exactly the same terms as the freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.087" offset="28060693">And there is the Associated Press case which comes about as close to being a prior restraint on the press case as you can get without perhaps being technically a prior restraint case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6998.880" offset="28099877">The reason of course that there are not prior restraint cases with respect to the press is that ordinarily you don’t find out about it until it’s been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.719" offset="28143240">Reference has been made to the fact oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.630" offset="28150868">There are leaks all the time, there are great many leaks, but I would point out that there is also a very widespread respect of the security classification system and its potentiality on the security of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="7188.589" offset="28858786">As Chief Justice Marshall said so long ago, it is a Constitution we are interpreting and all we ask for here is the construction of the Constitution in the light of the fact that it is a part of the Constitution and that there are other parts of the Constitution which grants powers and responsibilities to the executive.</text>
