            <label>Mr. Paul A. Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="17.307" offset="172596">If it please the Court, my name is Paul Rosen and I along with Mr. William Kunstler will represent the petitioners in this oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.192" offset="224110">I intend to discuss the Fourteenth Amendment issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.931" offset="243127">Mr. Kunstler will follow and discuss the Thirteenth Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.964" offset="263189">We have raise Section 1981 in our brief and if time permits, we will discuss it although we feel that we have amply covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.316" offset="316688">This case represent but another attempt by the City of Jackson to nullify the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment, to avoid the decision of Brown versus Board of Education, and to deny black people their rights as guaranteed by the Civil War Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.262" offset="416371">Until 1963, Jackson, Mississippi operated its recreational facilities on a segregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.174" offset="460048">This is eight years after this Court in the Dawson case proclaimed that recreational facilities should no longer be operated on a segregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.331" offset="496724">But despite this, the City of Jackson maintained its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.953" offset="519189">And so in 1962 and ’63, black citizens of Jackson, Mississippi went to the federal courts and asked those courts to invoke the Brown decision to desegregate the recreational facilities in Jackson including the five municipal pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.561" offset="605602">These five pools, one of which was leased from a YMCA were operated on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.599" offset="641755">For one-third of the population, the black population of Jackson, Mississippi, they are one pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.153" offset="671953">For two-thirds of the population, the white population of Jackson, Mississippi, they had four pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.269" offset="696404">And so this was the situation, and this was a situation which faced the court in Clark versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.757" offset="722422">And in Clark versus Thompson, the court ordered that the pools and the other recreational facilities would be desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.027" offset="759515">They must be integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.017" offset="763486">This was the law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.099" offset="779786">And what did the City of Jackson, Mississippi do?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.324" offset="792639">Did they attempt to integrate the pools?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.466" offset="809253">Did they make any effort whatsoever in good faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="180.299" offset="824613">No, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.832" offset="834748">Indeed, the City of Jackson followed what the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals called in 1963 and it took judicial notice of an official steel hard inflexible policy of official segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.798" offset="894516">They closed the pools rather than integrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.425" offset="909040">And so we have a new form of separation in Jackson, Mississippi. Blacks and whites could not swim in the pools before Clark versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.593" offset="949791">Blacks and whites do not swim in the pools after Clark versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.285" offset="976541">Now what the city did was in keeping of the statutory scheme of the State of Mississippi, for the state requires city officials to do everything in their power, to avoid the mandate of Brown, and to prevent mixing in recreational facilities including pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.908" offset="1058983">Now, the court below found the respondents admit that the purpose for closing the pools, the motive for closing the pools was the integration order.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.988" offset="1107362">That fact is not in dispute in this case solely because they were told that black and white bodies must touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.072" offset="1147695">That was the catalyst; that was the action which closed these pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.199" offset="1176116">Now, the city claims that the problem is that when you integrate pools, there might have been violence and there might have been economic loss, sheer speculation, for they never operated the pools on an integrated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.120" offset="1227839">For other recreational facilities that had been integrated, have been integrated in a peaceful way, but pure simple speculation, and so the situation is that four pools are now closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.933" offset="1303071">The one pool that was leased from the YMCA was returned to the YMCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.517" offset="1329403">And now, it’s being operated on a white only basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.261" offset="1352391">Do you know what the status Mr. Rosen of the pools is?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.425" offset="1365034">Are they merely closed or have they been defacilitized so to speak, what is their status?</text>

            <text syncTime="327.507" offset="1413413">We have pictures if the Court is interested, which were taken some two or three weeks ago which indicate of course that the water is out, that there is a minimum of maintenance necessary to get the pools back in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.268" offset="1460433">Of course, in the affidavits in this case, the city maintained that they were maintained these pools eventhough they were in a closed status.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.339" offset="1516753">It’s just a single sentence and it’s nowhere elaborated that I could see in either brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.111" offset="1603793">I might only suggest to the Court that it seems rather odd that the city here who proclaims that there will be violence, and that there will economic loss if they, the city, integrate pools suggest that a private individual has been willing to take on this burden, and has opened an integrated pool without violence and without economic loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.792" offset="5454555">Now, because of Brown, if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stands, they had no pools.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Kunstler</label>
            <text syncTime="1369.933" offset="5583078">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.321" offset="5596662">I’m going to carry on from my brother Rosen to the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.310" offset="5620590">I recognized that you could decide this case on the Fourteenth Amendment without much problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.024" offset="5647444">But I want to make a strong an argument as I can to go further than that and I’d like to pose my argument this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.361" offset="5684851">I start from the premise that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery and established universal freedom from Mr. Justice Bradley’s comment in the Civil Rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.863" offset="5738872">And then go to Mr. Justice Stewart in Jones against Mayer were based on the Thirteenth Amendment and writing for this Court, he indicated that Congress was authorized by that amendment to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.264" offset="5832391">And I remember, Mr. Justice Stewart, you emphasized in the opinion, at least in my report those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.379" offset="5860916">Or again as Mr. Justice Stewart put it in footnote 78 of the Jones opinion that the amendment authorized Congress to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.453" offset="5921207">But Mr. Justice Stewart left open the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.710" offset="5934164">He asked really, did the amendment itself do any more than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.308" offset="5952554">And I want to pitch my argument to the fact that it did, in my opinion, do more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.260" offset="5976377">Our position is a fundamental one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.218" offset="5992260">It is essentially that the amendment puts an affirmative duty on all branches of Government including this Court to eliminate all badges and incidents of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.732" offset="6038340">It is self-executing if all of the justices in the Civil Rights case have any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.273" offset="6064462">They agreed on one thing that it was a self-executing amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.989" offset="6083375">And I think Mr. Justice Bradley used the words by its terms was applicable to any existing set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.159" offset="6115976">We come here with one of those existing set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.614" offset="6137814">If the amendment did abolish slavery truly and it did establish universal freedom, then our position is that it gives this Court the power independent of any act of Congress, the power to abolish any incident of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.161" offset="6208031">In other words, it authorized all branches of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.226" offset="6220257">The executive, legislative and judicial to do everything and I’ll quote again from the Civil Rights cases, “everything necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.682" offset="6282115">And I guess the question Your Honors comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.661" offset="6294026">What is the badge in incident of slavery?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_m_kunstler" startTime="1556.373" stopTime="1984.233">
            <label>Mr. William M. Kunstler</label>
            <text syncTime="1556.373" offset="6328822">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.218" offset="6336240">There could be no more badge of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.369" offset="6344808">In fact, that’s so typical a badge of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.072" offset="6355675">The black people couldn’t be educated at all was one of the elements of the slave state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.574" offset="6377618">In fact, it was a crime, Mr. Justice Harlan as you know in many states, to educate black people and one punishable by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.492" offset="6409383">Question is what is a badge or incident of slavery and I go to Mr. Justice Douglas because in Jones, he lists the whole number of things which he indicates are badges of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.580" offset="6465703">Talks about voting restrictions, exclusions from jury, segregated courtrooms, segregated schools, denial of educational benefits in higher institutions of learning, marriage, marrying outside of one’s race, living in segregated ghettos, riding in segregated railroads or enjoying life in segregated public parks, restaurants, public beaches, municipal golf courses, amusement parks, buses, public libraries, etcetera, and being referred to by one’s first name as Mary Hamilton was in an Alabama Court, even if she happens to be an adult woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.624" offset="6617840">I would like to utilize what Mr. Justice Douglas included in his concurring opinion in Jones, what Frederick Douglas said, because he said and I think, and I have to speak from a black man’s viewpoint “Yeah, that’s impossible being a white man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.472" offset="6677295">All I can say is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.701" offset="6686177">And he said the black man has seized to be the slave of an individual but has in some sense become the slave of society.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.547" offset="6713553">And that’s where we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.184" offset="6720136">He is the slave of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.846" offset="6726719">He has an incident of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.921" offset="6735078">He cannot swim in the pools next to white people because of all the sexual and metaphysical connotations of water and contact of bodies, what Mr. Justice Douglas observed about motels which have swimming pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.205" offset="6800175">I think the general definition that we would like to urge upon this Court is that an incident of slavery is anything that makes a black man reasonably feel inferior to a white man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.876" offset="6842911">It’s the opposite of what Mr. Justice Brown said in Plessy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.493" offset="6861302">He said if the black race chooses to put that interpretation upon writing in segregated coaches, that’s their lookout, not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.383" offset="6892857">But I submit that it is your lookout, our lookout because this Court is really nothing more than an extension of the American personality, an extension of the American sociology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.102" offset="6943744">I would put it in other way as a badge or incident of slavery anything that would downgrade the concept of national citizenship as envisioned in the war timed amendments would be a badge of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.054" offset="6999542">It’s as Mr. Justice Douglas said “Things that have remained in the minds and hearts of many white men.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.421" offset="7025037">And I think he’s charitable by adding the adjective “many” in front of the words white men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.011" offset="7047398">Now what makes a black man feel inferior to a white man?</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.433" offset="7061086">It’s any act which he can reasonably construe at something which stamps him with a badge of inferiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.611" offset="7089821">And some of these things I’ve indicated from Mr. Justice Douglas’s dissent --concurring opinion in Jones, but they all have a common thread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.660" offset="7125974">They emphasize unequal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.430" offset="7137050">They remind black people that they once were chattels to be bought and sold like cows and sheep in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.185" offset="7168084">Now, does the closing of the pools, the swimming and wetting pools do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.665" offset="7186056">We say it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.083" offset="7191698">And I set forth in my argument a number of reasons why it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.868" offset="7210820">One, to ask a few questions: What construction will a black person put on the closing of the pools?</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.843" offset="7242794">It’s a different construction than a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.714" offset="7254183">A white person will be inconvenienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.425" offset="7261080">He won’t swim also, that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.131" offset="7271946">But to him, it doesn’t mean that he was once a slave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.450" offset="7285217">It only means that because there is an inferior race that some judicial system has said “may swim with him” that that inferior race is not going to swim with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.366" offset="7328789">But for the black man, it has a wholly different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.686" offset="7342164">It means he’s not good or clean enough to swim with white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.051" offset="7367555">In Judge Wisdom’s dissent, I think he perceptively saw that down in New Orleans with the flood of cases that come through with the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.036" offset="7407470">He said “We should recognize the actual traumatic effect of the action on Negroes for what it was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.286" offset="7436518">And I think unless this Court recognized what these things do to black people, then I guess we’re in for a very hard time in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.415" offset="7472985">No black person could fail to get the message about the closing of the pools meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.738" offset="7494301">Mayor Thompson put it very coldly “We are not going to have any intermingling in the pools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.530" offset="7517497">And as Justice Douglas said in his concurrence in Jones, “A vacancy sign at a motel doesn’t mean what it says especially if the motel has a swimming pool.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.883" offset="7562951">Mr. Justice Douglas as a white man must understand what it means to mingle in the pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.747" offset="7590327">Why there is such unholy opposition to that contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.504" offset="7613419">The second question is who did it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.809" offset="7626585">And the white community did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.998" offset="7635362">Just as the white community segregated the railroad that ran around a bunch of train in Plessy against Ferguson, so the white community in Jackson closed the pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.631" offset="7685935">Why did they do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.376" offset="7692831">Next inquiry; to avoid integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.349" offset="7704743">Why avoid integration?</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.736" offset="7714356">Because black people are beings of an inferior order and altogether, unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.441" offset="7761168">That’s just Mr. Chief Justice Charley, he saw it quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.394" offset="7776946">Or he said in another way “This is by way we erect a perpetual an impossible barrier between the races.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.865" offset="7806830">Or another way “we must separate the unhappy black race from the white by indelible marks, ” or finally, “we impress deep and enduring marks of inferiority and degradation on black people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.757" offset="7870360">And that is the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.246" offset="7880391">That is why I think the Court must take a stand and say “Yes, the closing of the pools violates the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.790" offset="7914559">That we as a Court have just as much responsibility as Congress, just as much responsibility as the executive in wiping out these badges, because unless they are wiped out, no black person can feel secure in the United States and every black person will begin eventually to build up a rage that is already sufficient enough that will build up a rage inside that he knows that in white eyes, he is an inferior person.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.864" offset="8458846">I would say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.031" offset="8463548">I take the fact that that would be if it were in a way of emphasizing inferiority of women, I would argue on that score.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.458" offset="8509210">Well, it would not be -- I’m not assuming that anyone would declare that and if they thought it, they certainly wouldn’t declare.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.706" offset="8590190">I would see a little different situation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.344" offset="8604714">Despite what women’s liberation movement feels, women were not true slaves in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.836" offset="8630732">They have a lot of the incidents, I think, but they weren't true slaves as black people were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.330" offset="8652675">There’s a whole different set of facts, if you do it to keep black people from swimming with white people because black people are inferior, that’s a little different between separating the sexes as they do for example, Mr. Chief Justice, where people swim nude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.115" offset="8711816">They do separate the sexes in one pool or another, or have different hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.643" offset="8733968">That’s a logical distinction to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.072" offset="8739610">That’s reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.784" offset="8742536">That’s not the inferiority of anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.776" offset="8750477">That’s a morality question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.926" offset="8759045">But if you did it where people wore bathing suits, unless it were in the area of the inferiority of women being proclaimed in some way, then I think it’s a different picture than we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.508" offset="8801364">Everything here comes out of the historical mammoth fact that black people were slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.334" offset="8824665">And if you do this, if you close these pools this way, which is not covered by the Civil Rights Act because there are no pools to be integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.740" offset="8858311">This is an unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.430" offset="8865102">This is closing the facility for everybody because you don’t want one element of the population to swim with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.899" offset="8894986">And I think that’s a peculiar area for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.494" offset="8909302">I think it’s an important area for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.681" offset="8918079">I thought Mr. Justice Stewart was pointing the way by his unanswered question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.805" offset="8934588">I’m trying to get the Court to answer of the question that Mr. Justice Stewart posed in Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.460" offset="8957262">And I think it’s a question that has to be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.089" offset="8967711">I realized that the tendency of the Court is to go into a much explored area, which would be the Fourteenth Amendment certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.585" offset="9009716">But I’m indicating that there are responsibilities of the Court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.700" offset="9026121">And I think this is an area where the case that Mr. Justice Stewart might have been imagining, has now arrived at the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.105" offset="9059767">You have two or three roads which you could take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.379" offset="9072933">I’m asking you essentially to take the road of the broad sweep of judicial power and to declare that the Court independently of Congress moving and it may never move in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.500" offset="9121416">Indeed, as Mr. Chief Justice Burger’s question has indicated, it maybe an area where you can’t legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.712" offset="9150255">Maybe, a unique area and there are many unique areas of this so they can’t be imagined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.626" offset="9173870">I would like to indicate just briefly in closing that I thought that the first, Mr. Justice Harlan saw clearly what courts should do in situations like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.149" offset="9219950">He made both a poetic and I think an accurate observation in the Civil Rights dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.362" offset="9244818">He said “It is not the words of the law, but the internal sense of it that makes the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.160" offset="9268015">The letter of the law is the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.288" offset="9276479">The sense and reason of the law is the soul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.457" offset="9289226">And I am appealing to the soul of the law both for practically, humanitarian and ethical and philosophical considerations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.654" offset="9329977">He went on to add that there cannot be in this republic any class of human beings in practical subjection to another class with power in the latter to dole out to the format just such privileges as they may choose to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.127" offset="9395911">The class that has one in subjection has now withdrawn a facility which was open to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.732" offset="9434258">One pool segregated for blacks, four for whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.663" offset="9457977">They add, as Mr. Justice Stewart indicated, it gotten rid of one and we can leave that out of consideration (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.658" offset="9485981">But they have taken the other four and closed them, maintained them and they are determined that black and white body shall not mingle in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.322" offset="9524642">That is putting black people in practical subjection to another class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.859" offset="9546794">And that is what under our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.579" offset="9561736">This Court, I feel very personally and emotionally that this Court must say answers the question that your brother posed in Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.592" offset="9609697">What is the full extent of the Thirteenth Amendment, that amendment that started in such fire and flamboyance and with such high hopes and is now taken almost a hundred years just to resuscitate as you did in Jones one portion of it, the right to buy a home in Patrick Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.053" offset="9695587">It goes much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.891" offset="9702902">It must make black people feel that they have the same status as white people and truly feel that in the deepest heart, unless they do, I am certain that the rage will consume the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.961" offset="9771238">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.165" offset="9811989">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.625" offset="9833827">On the belief that the Court please, that we still hear law suits on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.771" offset="9866428">I would like to take just a moment at the outset if I might, and talk about Clark versus Thompson, the case back in 1962 that preceded all of this discussion because I’m not certain from the references in the briefs to Clark versus Thompson that all of the members of the Court may understand precisely what happened in Clark versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.788" offset="9966529">Wherein 1962, the District Court in Jackson, Mississippi declared that certain individual plaintiffs were entitled to the unsegregated use of all public, recreational facilities that is including zoos, parks, auditoriums, libraries, golf courses, all public recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.675" offset="10090036">Now that was a declaratory judgment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.212" offset="10108217">No injunction was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.224" offset="10124309">Now what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.043" offset="10127548">From the way that case is cited in the briefs, I’m afraid you withdraw the conclusion that the city appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.214" offset="10156178">The city accepted Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.684" offset="10174151">The plaintiff’s appeal seeking the sweeping injunction that had not been granted by the District Court and no injunction was granted by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.526" offset="10217514">Then the plaintiffs sought certiorari here and again were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.517" offset="10237471">My point simply being at the outset that from the moment the Clark decision was made by district Judge Meyers, the City of Jackson accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.932" offset="10287104">And from that day to this, every public facility in the City of Jackson, Mississippi where the recreational or otherwise which is open is fully segregated, and I think that’s --</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.951" offset="10475186">And we can agree on this, the decision in Clark versus Thompson was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.601" offset="10501726">It has never been questioned by the City of Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.551" offset="10517608">And we can agree on this, and I’m sure you’re going to ask me so I’ll go ahead and say it at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.067" offset="10551672">The administrative decision by the City of Jackson, Mississippi to close the swimming pools came after the Clarke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.744" offset="10598379">It came after the declaratory judgment had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.525" offset="10617501">It came as a result of it, and I would not stand here as an officer of this Court a brand new one at that and tell you otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.083" offset="10659715">It came after the Clark case and as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.693" offset="10682180">But if the Court please, here’s where we get to the difference, and here’s where we get to the heart of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.293" offset="10716557">The decision to close the swimming pools in Jackson, Mississippi was not out of spite or hatred, or any of the other insidious motives asserted in the briefs filed in this Court by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.808" offset="10798582">While the decision to close the swimming pools came after the Clark case, it was not from a desire to crush black people or to reinstate badges of slavery for goodness sakes or to discriminate against black people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.780" offset="10878516">Here’s what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.543" offset="10889592">The record shows if the Court please that the Clark decision brought new problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.540" offset="10917491">Now here’s the city Council in the City of Jackson, Mississippi in 1963 right or wrong, and I contend in all difference, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.672" offset="10946017">Right or wrong, the city council of the City of Jackson honestly felt that the personal safety of some of its citizens and the maintenance of law and order could be in danger if swimming pools were integrated in that city at that time, right or wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.326" offset="12504691">And they throw out endless arguments in the hope that one of them will catch fire in the heart of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.627" offset="12541889">They say if the Court please and they say this without authority, and they say it all the way through their briefs that the City of Jackson, Mississippi has the burden of proving that the closing of the pools was not for a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.877" offset="12614928">You see, being the plaintiffs below and having made no such proof, they get in the appellate courts and switch and say “Well the burden was on the city to prove that it did not have an improper motive when it closed the pools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.185" offset="12688071">And they cite time and again and referred to at the moment they reach the floor this morning, a statement from another Fifth Circuit case in 1963 I believe, to the effect that Jackson, Mississippi has maintained a steel hard, inflexible, undeviating official policy of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.088" offset="12783679">Now here’s what they’re really saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.628" offset="12797889">What they’re really saying is that whenever Jackson, Mississippi is involved in a lawsuit, no matter what the proof is, this Court must assume that there was a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.232" offset="12856299">That’s what they’re saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.867" offset="12866853">You see, the argument appeals to the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.438" offset="12885138">The argument appeals to the popular criticism of the south in years going by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.575" offset="12913664">I submit to the Court that the argument is an attempt to pin the badge of slavery that counsel discusses upon Jackson and cities of the deep south to ask you today and I guess forever, to judicially assume no matter what the proof is that the motive of Jackson, Mississippi was to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.107" offset="13027767">Now, I have no purpose before this Honorable Court to attempt to justify any of the constitutional privileges that were denied blacks in the past, both in Jackson, Mississippi and elsewhere throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.135" offset="13103940">But I say to the Court that Jackson, Mississippi accepted the Clark decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.941" offset="13131107">Jackson’s public facilities are integrated totally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.187" offset="13160155">I think you’re well aware that Jackson, Mississippi has the most integrated school system in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.885" offset="13198921">Jackson should not now or forever, unlike other litigants, have to prove itself not guilty, have to prove that it was not acting out of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.802" offset="13270601">Now, while arguing that we are trying to pin a badge of slavery on somebody, counsel is really saying “Keep Jackson, Mississippi in line.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.523" offset="13317413">Assume it to be wrong even though we have made no proof whatever to that effect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.545" offset="13357537">In addition to trying to shift the burden to the city, the petitioners are persistently saying that the closing of the swimming pool reflects upon that black people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.538" offset="14053543">It was closed to black people and white people just as the swimming pools were closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.226" offset="14080293">Now if the Court please, it was closed because of fear between -- of friction between the races, and it was closed incidentally at the request of the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.650" offset="14137971">Now, I mentioned this simply to point out that no one finds any discrimination from the perfectly proper and legal act of the City of Jackson in closing a public street which formally existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.148" offset="14443917">It certainly does, but there is simply no way for a city or a state for that matter to provide recreational opportunity of all sorts for all of its citizens, white or black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.532" offset="14529494">And when we step in to the recreational area, if the Court please, this could be endless because I could have my feelings hurt if a certain facility is not provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.013" offset="14591457">It’s provided in some other city and on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.404" offset="14612982">I think what the Fifth Circuit was trying to say and what I’m trying to say is that this decision to close the pools back in 1963 has unfortunately kept a few black people and a few white people from swimming, but this is penalized the poor people and not the more affluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.884" offset="14710888">And that’s not a Fourteenth Amendment question, nor Thirteenth Amendment question, and I think it’s interesting that the United States chose to file an amicus curiae brief in this Court, excellent brief, and did not mention the Thirteenth Amendment question which had been argued here this morning, did not mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.876" offset="14814856">And I think it was ignored by the United States because this is obviously not a Thirteenth Amendment question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3704.657" offset="14921958">That’s what they’re asking you to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.346" offset="14932720">They’re asking you take up sonnets from Jones and a phrase from the Thirteenth Amendment and a sonnets back from another decision here and branch out as he said in a sweeping judicial file, a landmark decision into nonessential, nongovernmental, purely recreational functions of a municipality in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.694" offset="15054137">I submit in all difference that if the federal courts in this country get into the swimming pool business, I don’t think it can stop with Jackson, Mississippi, because as I said a minute ago, these folks are not going to be satisfied with an order to reopen to probably now deteriorated pools in predominantly white neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.826" offset="15182660">They’re going to want other pools built.</text>

            <text syncTime="4210.070" offset="16943626">I might say that the black citizens did ask the council this summer to open the pools on an integrated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.243" offset="16972361">That request was rejected.</text>
