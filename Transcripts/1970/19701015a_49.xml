            <label>Mr. Norman Dorsen</label>
            <text syncTime="25.685" offset="206137">Thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.040" offset="211571">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.763" offset="222438">This is a third in the succession of Bar admission cases that the Court has been hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.676" offset="242082">It’s an appeal from a decision of a three-judge court to the southern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.409" offset="264965">The suit in this case was an affirmative suit brought by three law students, three applicants to the Bar of the state of New York and three organizations, including a Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, challenging the constitutionality of certain statutes and statewide judicial rules governing the admission to the New York Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.450" offset="349184">In addition, the complaint made similar allegations concerning the implementation of the statutes and rules through questionnaires, affidavits, interviews and other practices I shall describe shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.101" offset="399757">A majority of the three-judge court below, Judges Friendly and Bonsal granted the appellants partial relief, but upheld its challenge statutes and statewide judicial rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.628" offset="449912">Judge Constance Motley, in an extensive dissenting opinion, took the view that the principle portions of the majority opinion were erroneous and she would have broadly declare unconstitutional one New York statute on its face, and the other as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.541" offset="513546">It’s important for an understanding of this case to perceive the type of personal and political screening program that takes place in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.324" offset="552626">The statutes and judicial rules that are relevant are set out in the appendix to the brief for appellants, starting on page 1a.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.763" offset="590451">Section 90 of the New York judiciary law provides, “the admission to and removal from the practice by the appellate division takes place when the appellate division and the State Board of Law Examiners are satisfied that each person who passes the bar exam, possess the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor at law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="146.907" offset="690970">Rule 81, immediately underneath Section 90 on page 3a of the appendix provides, this is an implementing rule that has the effect of a statute, “that each applicant to the bar must produce before a committee a character and fitness evidence that he possess the good moral character and general fitness requisite for an attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.197" offset="780204">On the facing page, page 2a, is Rule 9406 which provides “that no person shall receive a certificate from any committee, any bar committee and no person shall be admitted to practice as an attorney unless he shall furnish satisfactory proof to the effect among other things that he believes in the form of the Government of the United States and is loyal to such Government” and there are three other requirements including citizenship and residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.238" offset="896293">Now, these standards for admissions in the State of New York are implemented by a complex procedural mechanisms that delves deeply into the political and personal lives of each applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.242" offset="940387">I shall be more specific about this later.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.714" offset="950209">It will suffice to say now that each applicant must answer extended questionnaires that raise questions regarding every aspect of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.672" offset="994095">Secondly, there are so-called home life affidavits which must be submitted to the bar committee by persons who know the applicant personally and have visited in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.557" offset="1033592">Third, there are independent investigations that take place, including inquiries of the applicant’s school and draft board, his former employers and to police and other agencies, as well as the general public through publication in the New York law journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.637" offset="1089912">Finally, after all the information is reviewed by a committee member, a personal interview takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.967" offset="1115199">If there is nothing unorthodox about an applicant, the interview will be perfunctory and admission will follow almost automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.281" offset="1144456">But if there some unorthodox political activity or associations, there is an intensified investigation, new interviews, new questions and sometimes a delay in admission at personal and professional cost to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.712" offset="1198268">All these takes place at a low level of visibility, but the effect on the constitutional rights of the applicant is destructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.368" offset="1228884">First, it involves an unwarranted intrusion broadly into their political and personal privacy and secondly, it inhibits the exercise of First Amendment rights by law students and applicants because of a fear of delay in admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.341" offset="1284786">All this is destructive to them, it’s also destructive to the national interest as I shall try to --</text>

            <text syncTime="301.139" offset="1307878">Is this questionnaire used in all departments?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.325" offset="1328671">This is the second department.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.558" offset="1333582">There are -- this case involves the second department and the first department, but there are questionnaires in all four departments.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.084" offset="1355734">And of the same character?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="314.288" stopTime="692.457">
            <label>Mr. Norman Dorsen</label>
            <text syncTime="314.288" offset="1360541">Very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.361" offset="1368795">The three-judge court below unanimously agreed in an opinion by Judge Friendly that certain practices of the bar committees were invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.597" offset="1409755">They held question 27(a), which ask applicants, “Do you believe in the principles of the form of the government of the United States to be impermissibly vague and overbroad?”</text>
            <text syncTime="339.604" offset="1461791">It held question 26 also invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.823" offset="1478614">That question dealt and currently deals with membership in organizations advocating overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.100" offset="1511737">Judge Friendly held that the question is at formally provided was invalid because it did not require knowledge by the applicant of the illegal purposes of the organization and there was no requirement that the illegal activity of the organization be coincident with the membership of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.826" offset="1578715">Finally, Judge Friendly held invalid question 31, which formally inquired whether there was any incident in your life, the life of the applicant, that was called for by the forgoing questions on the questionnaire, which has any favorable or detrimental bearing on your character or fitness and Judge Friendly held that this kind of soul-searching question was too broad and he struck it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.295" offset="1680593">At the same time, the defendants themselves deleted certain questions from their questionnaire and what Judge Motley termed the tacit confession of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.472" offset="1721240">These extremely broad questions, which are found on page 183 of the record, dealt broadly with membership in organizations and societies that the applicant may have joined before and during law school and extra curricular activities that he engaged in or may have engaged in while a student, but the majority below upheld the two relevant New York statutes and the implementing questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.841" offset="1826774">We have many objections, both to the statutes and the questions and the implementing procedures, but they boil down to two principle points.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.424" offset="1861047">The first point is that Section 9 -- Rule 9406, which is on 2a of the appendix, and the implementing question, question 27, are invalid because they compel a declaration of belief and are impermissibly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.991" offset="1923323">Second, that Section 90 of the judiciary law, the good moral character standard, which incidentally we do not dispute on its face because we accept Judge, Justice Frankfurter’s for this formulation of the good moral character standard as Mr. Boudin stated yesterday from the Schware case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.125" offset="1991868">But we do maintain that Section 90 has been invalidly applied because it’s been used to test the political ideas of the applicants that are protected by the First Amendment, both because of the invalidity of the revised question 26, which is found in page 6a of the appendix and because of the impermissibly broad pattern of investigation into protected activity that the bar committees undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.117" offset="2099806">Now, before turning to my first point, I would like very briefly to make four preliminary comments that are central to an understanding of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.206" offset="2136168">The first concerns the deterrent effect on a political activity of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.246" offset="2156335">I have seen this for 10 years at New York University law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.672" offset="2170023">This is not an imagination, this is not a product of anyone’s imagination, it is not a chimerical allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.224" offset="2200221">There are students who are deterred from political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.600" offset="2213804">There are professors who tell students not to engage in political activity until they’re members of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.331" offset="2236688">Some of the most responsible students, some of the best students are deterred from lawful political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.614" offset="2261870">Many of these students and the families of these students have gone to great extent to put them through law school, even a delay of a few months in earning a living is relevant to the prospects of their families and their own prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.239" offset="2312338">The two cases that are cited in the brief, the cases of Messrs Rosenberg and Kaimowitz are examples of people who have been delayed by the character committee for engaging an undoubted political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.633" offset="2357896">Secondly, nothing that is being urged here in any sense is inconsistent with the ability of the bar and the courts to discipline improper conduct of applicants or members of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.338" offset="2408678">Mr. Boudin has reviewed four different types of sanctions that are available and I shall not repeat them, but I will deal with one other aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.207" offset="2444204">Every one of us is concern by violence, everyone of us is concern by disruption in courtrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.036" offset="2467506">In my experience, the bar associations of this country are able to respond to this problem in a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.724" offset="2494255">The ABA has setup a special committee under Judge Murray and who’s a member of the District Court in the First Circuit, to set standards for behavior by judges, by lawyers, by spectators and by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.827" offset="2542634">That committee has already issued a preliminary report.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.021" offset="2555486">The bar association of the City of New York has setup a special committee with men like Bruce Bromley, Best Webster, George Lindsey and Burk Marshall on the committee to look into the same matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.607" offset="2597804">I have the privilege of being the Executive Director of that study.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.789" offset="2610552">The bar association has not been delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.359" offset="2620792">The bar associations of this country are able to deal with conduct that is impermissible, conduct that deserves the sanction of either the Bar or the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.715" offset="2662275">But this is not conduct we’re dealing with here, it’s the delving into protected political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.981" offset="2687248">Third, none of the criticisms of the statute, none of the criticisms of the questions, none of the criticisms of the practices that we’re making here are meant in a slightest to impute a good faith, the integrity of the members of the bar committees, the members of the Courts of New York or any other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.014" offset="2759450">These men are operating under a system that was handed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.932" offset="2775124">They are doing their very best to implement that system, but it’s a system that was setup without full consciousness of the First Amendment problems that are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.572" offset="2809710">I want to repeat, we’re not criticizing individuals, we’re not suggesting that there’s a certain venality or arbitrariness on the part of particular people or committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.862" offset="2846804">But the fact of the matter is a structure has been setup that’s improper and it should be dealt with.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.324" offset="2992671">It does not Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.332" offset="2996746">The final preliminary point I would like to make is there’s no need for this Court to overrule the Konigsberg and estoppel cases to deal with the invalid statutes and practices here.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.695" offset="3042200">The question in the Konigsberg was a different kind of question from the question that is being asked of the applicants in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.455" offset="3069158">The foundation for the question as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in both opinions in those cases had been laid and the committee was trying to fill in gaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.165" offset="3108028">There are no gaps here, there is no foundation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.505" offset="3121403">We’re dealing here with questions that are being asked of every single applicant to the New York Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.690" offset="3146167">The entire generation of lawyers, they are going to have deal with the problems that all of us are dealing with at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.056" offset="3175633">And finally, Konigsberg and estoppel are distinguishable of course, because the governing constitutional principles that have evolve -- have been evolved by this Court have changed in last decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.643" offset="3221922">It’s exactly decades as the Konigsberg case was argued in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.159" offset="3243969">Now, what I would like to do is deal with the first principle point that I alluded to earlier, namely Rule 9406, which is found at page 2a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.126" offset="3295901">And here we have a rule which is of statewide applicability and has the force of the statute that whatever the doubts may have been in the Arizona case that Mr. Justice White raised, this is a belief question.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.885" offset="3350862">It is clear that each person who wants to be a member of the Bar must furnish satisfactory proof to the effect that he believes in the form of the Government of the United States and is loyal to that Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.115" offset="3403839">And there are many expressions by members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.936" offset="3415124">Mr. Justice Robert’s memorable quote was referred to yesterday by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.110" offset="3435813">Mr. Justice Jackson on another occasion expressed what seems to me the most cogent terms, the reasons why belief is absolutely inviolable.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.348" offset="3796720">It talks about the form of the Government, a form of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.599" offset="3813752">Does this mean the electoral system?</text>

            <text syncTime="931.973" offset="3831306">Does this mean the federal system?</text>
            <text syncTime="934.190" offset="3840084">The Center for Democratic Studies under Mr. Hudson (ph) has recently proposed a new Constitution, which would divide the country into regions, which would give different powers to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.138" offset="3883969">That would certainly change our form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.898" offset="3899016">Does an applicant to be in a position where he has to guess if he has unorthodox political views as to what the form of Government of United States really is or what a judge or jury might consider it to be and Judge Friendly dealt with this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.102" offset="3955754">He said that it was wrong and improper to inquire of an applicant as to whether he was loyal to the principles underlying the form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.904" offset="4006954">He did not explain why the same objections did not apply to the slightly shorter formulation, but it seems to me indistinguishable formulation, a form of Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.241" offset="4048332">And Judge Motley in her dissent raised this very question, and as far as I know there’s nothing in Judge Friendly’s opinion which satisfactory deals with this issue for the very reason suggested by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.739" offset="4098278">Now, the State says that Section 9406 is really like the constitutional oath that Mr. Justice Harlan raised in connection with the members of the Bar who just admitted that one will support the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.692" offset="4174137">But that’s not what this says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.647" offset="4181974">That’s just not what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.302" offset="4192632">There’s no warrant to revise this formulation in light of what would be a constitutional formulation especially is this true in light of question 27, which implements this section and says among other things, “Can you conscientiously and do you affirm that you are, without any mental reservation loyal to and ready to support the Constitution of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.892" offset="4318960">Now, the “without any mental reservation” clause is certainly a belief clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.743" offset="4346337">Mental reservation -- a man may have a question about the bicameral system, about one man one vote, about whether or not in this modern age we need Regional Government rather than State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.121" offset="4399835">Now, this section or this Rule 9406, the implementing question are invalid for a wholly distinct reason and that is under Speiser and Randall, it impermissibly places the burden of proof on the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.057" offset="4459604">Judge Motley said on her opinion that this was the very heart of the case and the reason Judge Motley thought this was the very heart of the case is spelled out fully in Justice Brennan’s opinion in the Speiser case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.671" offset="4514043">And that is that the hazard of mistaken fact finding is so great and a potential loss to the applicant and the law student is so great that he will steer far wider of the unlawful zone if he has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.984" offset="4575274">Now in its brief, the State attempts to avoid the thrust of Speiser without even mentioning the case by saying that there’s a distinction between coming forward with evidence, the burden of initial coming forward on the one hand and the burden of ultimate proof on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.373" offset="4652910">It seems to us that this is an inadequate answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.656" offset="4665971">In the first place the language of Rule 9406 says explicitly that the applicant must furnish satisfactory proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.704" offset="4702229">The burden of proof is built in to the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.151" offset="4716022">Secondly, the practical implementation of this section in New York as both the Kaimowitz and the Rosenberg cases which are cited incidentally on page 10 of the brief in opposition to the motion to affirm show that the way the mechanism works and very naturally works is that when there’s a question about an applicant, as the gentleman from Ohio said a moment ago, more questions are asked until the Bar Committee is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.022" offset="4827512">And of course, under Section 90, at the top of page 3a of the Appendix, it says that the State Board of Law Examiners must be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.497" offset="4869308">Now, that’s burden of proof language and I might add that despite what New York says here, in the Konigsberg opinion itself at 366 US, page 41 in the footnote, Mr. Justice Harlan lists New York State as among the states where the burden of proof is on the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.315" offset="4952586">So, it seems to us that apart from the defects that are inherent in the rule and the implementing question, the burden of proof problems that are raised by Speiser and Randall are all together supportive of our concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.474" offset="7985298">I think it should be said that the appellate divisions of the State of New York in the first and second department have been extremely sensitive and conscientious, indeed on their own about these requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.914" offset="8147048">But before these cases were started, the courts on their own, became concerned about historical record and whether it was up-to-date and modern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.452" offset="8205145">And they went through the requirements and the questions and made substantial changes in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.410" offset="8240985">Then these proceedings were started and with the matters of complaint here, they looked at them again and made some other changes, before the matter ever got into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.922" offset="8315068">And finally, as the third stage, the courts have had the benefit of the statutory court’s review of the procedures and it’s holding as to what was proper and what was improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.558" offset="10109576">Now, what does that inquiry consist of as far as good moral character is concerned? It consists simply of one thing in Rule 8 of the Rules of the New York Court of Appeals for Admission of Attorneys.</text>
