            <text syncTime="88.104" offset="455764">This matter comes to the Court on appeal from a three-judge court sitting in California United States District Court, Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.786" offset="498500">The matter comes up from a summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.539" offset="509576">The summary was in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.246" offset="520338">The first part was a declaratory judgment ruling at Article XXXIV of the State of California constitution was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, Equal Protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.695" offset="574151">The second part was a declaratory judgment -- pardon me, in permanent injunction against the defendants in the case of availing themselves or relying on the provisions Article XXXIV as a reason for not proceeding with the acquisition construction or development of low rent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.843" offset="654712">The Supreme Court has jurisdiction of this case under 28 U.S.C. 1253 in appeal from a permanent injunction by a three-judge court against the enforcement of or obedience to the provisions of a State constitution of provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.070" offset="715630">The cases before the Court are really two.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.865" offset="730781">The first is James versus Valtierra and the second is Haze versus The Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.112" offset="755858">In the first case, the plaintiffs Valtierre and other similarly situated on behalf of the class, people who were eligible for a low rent housing brought an action against the members of the city council of the City San Jose to have the Article XXXIV rule to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.883" offset="866931">In Haze versus housing authority and also in that action that joined as defendants where the members of the housing authority of the City of San Jose.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.835" offset="906742">In Haze versus the Housing Authority plaintiffs, plaintiff Gutsy Haze (ph) and other similarly situated brought the same type of action against the housing authority of San Mateo County.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.263" offset="956374">In the James case, an answer was filed, in the Haze case an answer was not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.647" offset="978004">The actions were consolidated for purposes of argument and the decision obtains as to both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.610" offset="1017814">The provisions of Article XXXIV which are at issue before the Court basically provide that no state public body shall acquire, construct or develop low rent housing unless the majority of the people, the electors qualify to vote in the locality in which the low rent housing is to be constructed by majority vote in favor of such low rent housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.454" offset="1161174">Under Article 4 of the State of California constitution, only legislative actions were referendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.379" offset="1192939">An opinion of the State Supreme Court, Housing Authority versus the Superior Court of Humble County in 1950 ruled that actions of a housing authority operating under the low rent housing procedure were administrative rather than legislative in character and therefore could not be reached by a referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.991" offset="1287293">Shortly thereafter in 1950, proposition 10 was placed before the voters of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.804" offset="1314565">That proposition is and was adopted as Article XXXIV so that in response to your question, the immediate purpose of Article XXXIV was to protect the people, to give the people the right to determine whether or not they wanted to extend low rent housing to the people in their particular area.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.318" offset="1708596">Of course I can’t really answer that question because I had nothing whatsoever to do with drafting the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.278" offset="1736495">I can only surmise that the people thought that this was a legitimate approach to protect their rights in a referendum area and I was attempting to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.484" offset="1777351">There are other types of referenda in California which are prior automatic referenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.313" offset="1812668">There are some, the initiative measure, there are certain type of annexation and consolidation procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.930" offset="1843075">The city charter of San Jose with which I’m quite acquainted has a provision for a prior automatic referendum of the area of Sailing Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.975" offset="1879228">And there are other types of prior automatic referenda, but I don’t feel that merely because we have a prior automatic referenda that that of itself lends any odious color to the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.865" offset="1974836">The people as long as they’re dealing in an area where they have the right to reserve something, as long they treat the area that they reserve uniformly and without treating any other similar area in a different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.464" offset="2041187">I feel there’s no unconstitutional treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.841" offset="2058742">The classification here in Article XXXIV is precisely limited to one small area, low rent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.352" offset="2100746">It deals with that area because I point it out before that was the area that the Supreme Court of California ruled was not referendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.939" offset="2135124">So that it certainly made sense for the people to strike out and to pick out that precise area as the subject of their referenda procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.974" offset="2183293">The proposition 10 itself when it was passed, the arguments pro and con are absolutely neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.131" offset="2219865">They’re all directed to the right of the people to reserve their voice in area where they have a concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.732" offset="2250271">There’s no illusion to race, there’s no illusion to a property per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.260" offset="2364374">It’s our contention that the article is -- as I pointed out before, fills the gap that it’s not an unconstitutional classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.071" offset="2415679">It’s not unconstitutional on its face, its not unconstitutional as applied, it’s not a classification based on race nor color, and it does not violate the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.969" offset="2483284">In the first place, the article merely deals with low rent housing and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.587" offset="2513690">It treats everyone in the area of low rent housing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.688" offset="2542111">And as such, it meets the tests that have been uniformly laid down with reference to the test that the Court applies in determining whether or not state legislative action is violative of the Equal Protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.510" offset="2621419">The case of the Hunter versus Erickson was cited as a precedent in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.662" offset="2657991">And I submit that Hunter versus Erickson on its facts is not this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.862" offset="2682859">In Hunter versus Erickson, we were dealing with the situation where the people of Akron had a referendum procedure with right across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.201" offset="2736149">They also had a fear housing ordinance which had a procedure set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.535" offset="2765511">People had been hired, categories had been established and it was actually under operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.748" offset="2794350">The enactment of the referendum procedure in the Hunter case in effect, resented or repealed the existing low rent housing ordinance, fair housing ordinance and built a prior referendum procedure on top of a regular referendum procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.383" offset="2872926">So that in Hunter, it could not have been argued that there was -- that there was no referenda procedure available and that therefore a new referendum procedure was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.012" offset="2919424">Secondly, the Court in Hunter specifically mentions the background of the referenda procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.526" offset="2953488">The fact that it repealed an existing fair housing ordinance, the fact it was racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.209" offset="2984208">In fact in the opinion, there are references that is inexplicitly racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.515" offset="3017435">In fact Mr. Justice Harlan and Stewart as I recall in their concurring opinion indicated that the provision has the clear purpose of making it more difficult for racial and racial minorities, religious and racial minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.416" offset="3085040">So, I submit that the case before you now is not the Hunter case and the Hunter case should be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.669" offset="3118059">And to apply the Hunter case here seems to me to be placing the Court as a super legislative body, second guessing the people in dealing in legislative areas, social concern areas that the Court in the Dandridge versus Williams said was their right.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.107" offset="4035793">The physical considerations flow from the fact that under the low cost housing procedure, the local public body takes the property which is the low rent housing project of the tax rules in return for 10% of the rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.969" offset="4115205">Now that means that also the people are required to provide certain municipal or county or what have you -- what ever level of Government that we’re dealing with services for the project, including possibly schools, parks, and the improvements of that nature which they wouldn’t normally have to provide if the low rent housing project did not go in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.579" offset="4233697">The other consideration is the fact that low rent housing is not a blessing right across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.336" offset="4280717">The experts in low rent housing disagree among themselves as to whether not as good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.836" offset="4302764">They’re all kinds’ arguments about how large the housing should be, when it should be acquired constructed and developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.648" offset="4329932">When it should be and questions of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.227" offset="4380296">In fact, there has been some history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.913" offset="4395029">I point out the housing project in Saint Louis which was an absolute fiasco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.874" offset="4418853">In the past, most of these housing projects have been mandate nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.498" offset="4433377">They have let actually to internal segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.044" offset="4443512">They let to isolation, get a isolation and some of them have as I say fallen flat on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.201" offset="4476217">As I recall in Saint Louis, over 50% of that project is now vacant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.691" offset="4502131">Realizing that the people are only getting back 10% of the rents in return for taking property which might be extremely valuable in terms of tax return off the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.246" offset="4544345">If a projects fails, the people certainly should have the right to consider that aspect before they want a low cost housing project to go in anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.430" offset="4581125">Because 10% of a project, 100% filled full, is certainly not the same as 10% of the rents of the project only 40% or 50% full.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.654" offset="4674017">That brings up a very interesting area up for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.540" offset="4693556">Actually, 34 has not been discriminatory as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.836" offset="4710693">As a matter of fact most of the elections have been voted in favor of the low rent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.282" offset="4736502">The reason that it’s even close in terms of units is because in Los Angeles as I recall in 1952, a 10,000 unit low cost housing project was turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.987" offset="4791359">But as I understand it, that was never resubmitted to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.770" offset="4814451">There’s nothing in 34 that prohibits low cost housing from going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.963" offset="4831274">It merely requires a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.895" offset="4838902">And I submit that it’s any different from any type of vote, school bond or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.538" offset="4861576">If that is turned down, the people still have the right to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.884" offset="4874951">The city council can again put up before the people and perhaps that’s a blessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.164" offset="4908074">If there’s something wrong with the project that gives everybody an opportunity to come back and think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.641" offset="4929912">It may have been poorly planned, the education of the electorate may not have been proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.583" offset="4953736">That people just -- that the proponents may not have done their homework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.649" offset="4974007">And I submit that it’s quite interesting that as I recall between 1968 and 1970, the percentage of referenda that had been approved are actually going up not down so that we are not dealing in an area where discrimination is running rampant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.082" offset="5047672">I also want to touch upon points that were brought up in the Appellees brief, they attempt to bring in this whole classification into invidious classification, suspect classification, classifications that are traditionally disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.335" offset="5116740">And I submit that this is not the kind of a classification which fits any of those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.079" offset="5147669">Most of the cases were the -- the Harper case for example, which mentioned that wealth and race were suspect classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.246" offset="5196361">The question of wealth really was not relevant to that case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.480" offset="5213288">The only reason it was important was because people who were poor were being deprived of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.339" offset="5236694">And the right to vote is a fundamentally constitutionally guaranteed right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.833" offset="5254666">And unless the Court here is willing to extend its tests of fundamentally guaranteed rights to low rent housing, I think it would be extremely dangerous to uphold the District Court in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.198" offset="5316211">Neither is this case, a criminal case where someone is asking for the right of a transcript on appeal or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.806" offset="5354559">I submit that this Article XXXIV is neutral in purpose, completely undiscriminatory in its face and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.200" offset="5388204">And I submit that again that it would seem to me that if the Court launches out in this area and strikes down 34, it would seem rather difficult to determine where the line will be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.265" offset="5472423">If a provisional constitutional provision like this can be stricken down by this Court, there’s no end to the intrusion of the judiciary into the legitimate concerns of legislative enactment of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.560" offset="5545566">So that again, I would submit that Article XXXIV should be deemed to be constitutional and that the decision of lower court be overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.266" offset="5628426">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.664" offset="5645981">In the appellees briefs we’ve canvassed the number of grounds which we believe that Article XXXIV of the California constitution violates both the Fourteenth Amendment and the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.501" offset="5705331">In my oral argument, I intend to confine myself to the essence of our argument under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.550" offset="5745560">And it very briefly is this, it’s that Article XXXIV violates the equal protection clause because it builds into the very structure of Government, of local Government in California an explicit discrimination against the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.059" offset="5811597">In the words of the statute against persons of low income who are defined, I should say of the constitution Article XXXIV, who are defined as persons whose income is insufficient to provide them with safe, decent and sanitary housing without overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.343" offset="5904697">The discrimination here as in Hunter against Erickson consists of putting the poor the disadvantaged class, putting before them a special obstacle which they must surmount in order to secure Government action in their behalf which faces no other group seeking Government action in its behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.126" offset="5999888">Hunter and Erickson held that that very kind of discrimination was unconstitutional where it ran against racial minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.439" offset="6037086">Our contention is, that it is equally unconstitutional where it runs explicitly against the poor and for the most part in practice also against racial minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.022" offset="6183476">Then, I think we would have a somewhat different case because here there clearly is discrimination between subsidized, middle income and upper income housing which is subsidized by the Federal Government and low rental housing for the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.146" offset="6255992">But I’m not sure that there wouldn’t still be an argument that the poor who would be still the chief ones in need of housing and the chief beneficiaries of housing where the victims of a discrimination taking a somewhat broader universe and looking at kinds of local Government action more broadly as the Court did, indeed as all the justices did in Hunter and Erickson. But for our purposes, that case can be left to another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.123" offset="6391829">Indeed, I think here and as I shall try to show a little farther on, whatever comparison you take, there is no neutral principle that will explain this discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.222" offset="6544280">And that is if the zoning laws required that all housing above certain numbers of units be submitted the referendum, then we would have a different question, that would cover high rise apartments for middle income and well to do, and it would certainly be arguable that there was some neutral principles so I think that case is really very different from mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.127" offset="6663920">I planned to develop the argument which I just get in four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.111" offset="6691819">The first is that Article XXXIV unquestionably I think erects a special obstacle in front of persons of low income in seeking to have their need for Government action to fulfill one of their greatest necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.953" offset="6775202">Having the Government act to fill it as compared with any other group, in order to get any housing project, public housing project under way in California quite apart from Article XXXIV, there must either have been or must be in the future of four principle steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.322" offset="6864645">The first would be state legislation empowering the municipalities to accept the benefits of the Housing Act -- Federal Housing Act of 1937 and constituting local housing authorities, that step has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.250" offset="6928384">The next step is the passage of a resolution by the County Government or the City Government as the case maybe, activating its housing authority and that step has been taken in both San Mateo County and in the City of San Jose, the two units involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.626" offset="7013857">Then the third step is a preliminary application for funds to prepare the drawings, get the estimates, take the other steps to get a housing project underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.438" offset="7073102">And that application must be approved by the board of supervisors for the county or by the city council for the city by resolution in the same manner as local government action is normally taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.688" offset="7134124">And at that time too by resolution, the local subdivision must enter into an agreement of cooperation with the federal housing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.138" offset="7171950">So, you have municipal action according to the normal channels at that step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.426" offset="7193057">Then the fourth step of course, would be approving the plans for the project, approving the bonds and the various other mechanics to occurring it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.319" offset="7232658">And I would emphasize that under California law, at that step again the local legislative body is required to approve the particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.481" offset="7281246">Now what the Article XXXIV does is to say in addition to those things, persons of low income who are seeking this kind of Government action in relief of their needs must go automatically to a referendum in which they secure popular approval of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.855" offset="7374764">This is an additional step to what would be required for any other effective kind of action by the local Government with the exception of issues of general revenue bonds which I’ll deal with a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.874" offset="7442892">The disadvantage which is expressly put on the poor by Article XXXIV is exactly the same I point out as the disadvantage under which the ordinance in Hunter and Erickson put those who were interested in fair housing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.901" offset="7522931">In Akron as in San Jose there was a general provision for a referendum on petition of a stated number of citizens, but the charter amendment in the Akron case called for an automatic referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.977" offset="7587297">And the Court said there that the difference was enough to constitute a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.911" offset="7611016">The differences here is exactly the same and we say that it too constitutes a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.012" offset="7643408">Some argument is made in the briefs that was made a few minutes ago by counsel to the effect that Article 4 Section 1 of the California constitution provides for a referendum and thus there is no discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.101" offset="7723760">I find out that there are three major differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.644" offset="7745912">First, Article 4 Section 1 does not provide for an automatic referendum, it provides for a referendum only on petition of a stated number of vote, 5% or 8% depending on the area we’re talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.834" offset="7822712">Second, the normal referendum in California comes after the subdivision or the legislator has acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.651" offset="7862000">And the action is effective unless beat out by the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.758" offset="7882376">Here, the referendum must be held before anything effective can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.926" offset="7903065">And the third, and very important point is that Article XXXIV sets up a one way street or it may be used to defeat housing but it may never be used to obtain housing whereas the normal initiative in referendum are linked together and they may operate both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.046" offset="7983522">And we submit that these three differences make a clear cut disadvantage of such a kind as denies the equal protection of the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2027.130" offset="8211937">I suppose, it would, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.577" offset="8225729">Shall the local housing authority, they authorized and directed to enter in the contracts with the Federal Government for such and such a number of units of housing.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2040.701" stopTime="2041.828">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2040.701" offset="8266167">particular place?</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2041.828" stopTime="2416.061">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2041.828" offset="8270660">And it could even say at a particular place or particular places since the housing is now in chiefly in smaller blocks then some of the housing projects that were described to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.355" offset="8324786">I would point out in addition that this not only operates as a disadvantage against poor as in Hunter and Erickson but that there is no neutral principle which can be invoked to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.018" offset="8415483">As I said a moment ago, our argument does not challenge the right of the voters of California to reserve housing and other like questions for popular approval provided that it is done in accordance with some neutral principle and then one gets the problem with defining the class that I was discussing an answer to the Chief Justice’s question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.067" offset="8503672">All the important characteristics and consequences of publicly owned housing projects of a low cost variety other than the involvement of persons of low income attached to other species of Government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.945" offset="8571173">California does not treat any of them as a cause for requiring an automatic referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.115" offset="8599803">For example, federal financing isn’t the reason for an automatic referendum in any number of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.907" offset="8642957">Urban renewal projects, highways, airports, hospitals, other things of that kind,other than effect upon land use isn’t otherwise treated as a need for a referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.465" offset="8697187">Well, the zoning laws can be changed in ways that permit shopping centers, industrial plants, high rise apartments that will change the character of the land for generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.590" offset="8757687">Indeed public ownership of projects that will affect the character of the land for generations is not generally treated as a reason for requiring mandatory popular approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.618" offset="8805857">Again airports, sewage disposal plants, educational buildings and urban renewal are example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.768" offset="8838457">Nor can it be said fairly I think, that the possible increase demand for municipal services resulting from a publicly owned housing project is a neutral reason for requiring a referendum because there are plenty of other changes attendant upon municipal law which will create a need for additional services but they are not made the basis for a mandatory referendum, universities, medical complexes, sports stadiums, hospitals, universities and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.768" offset="9014418">The lessening of tax revenues is suggested by the appellants as a neutral principle which certainly not everything that takes land of the tax rows even for public ownership is submitted to referendum in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.055" offset="9075545">In California there are only two so far as I know, kinds of mandatory referendum. One is a change in political boundaries or the structure of local Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.291" offset="9128521">Well, Article XXXIV make such a change that the vote taken under it on a housing isn’t a vote on a change in the political structure or political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.151" offset="9175960">The other mandatory referendum is required in the case of the issuance of bonds which are -- or bonds of the state, county, city or other subdivision of the Government and which constitute an obligation paid out of general tax revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.885" offset="9266866">The California Supreme Court pointed out that there are two important differences here between general municipal obligations and the bonds of the housing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.299" offset="9316603">One is that the housing authorities bonds are not obligations of the city, county, state or other public subdivision as required in the California constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.809" offset="9362578">Second, they most clearly are not obligations that must be paid out of general tax revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.986" offset="9391313">The bonds are paid by the Federal Government and to some small extent by any surplus rents over cost of maintenance of the building, but usually they are not, so in fact the bonds are obligations to the Federal Government and are paid by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.017" offset="9467486">In sum I think the indisputable purpose and effect of Article XXXIV is to erect this special obstacle in the path of the poor when they seek Government action that does not confront any other group when it is seeking political or governmental action in its behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.011" offset="9555466">Our second main point which I’ll develop tomorrow is to emphasize that Article XXXIV builds it’s unique bias against the poor into the very structure of the political system, person of low income, seeking government assistance are told in effect, will you stand differently before your Government than anyone else stands when he is seeking Government assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.624" offset="9665912">I emphasize this because this is not a case let’s say like 3953 Williams where one was dealing with substantive Government policies and where the Court said there was greater latitude in social and economic matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.469" offset="9721292">Here we’re dealing with the structure of Government itself.</text>
