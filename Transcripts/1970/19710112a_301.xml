            <label>Mr. Stephen A. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="15.753" offset="166431">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.227" offset="180328">25 years have elapsed since this Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Black in Bell against Hood, left for another day the question whether violation of the Fourth Amendment gives rise to a federal claim for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.498" offset="241351">After long last that question is once again presented to the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.945" offset="267160">Briefly the facts; the name of the case, Bivens against Six Unknown Federal Agents in a way tells a story.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.469" offset="301223">Began in the early morning darkness in November five years ago, when six narcotics agents with guns drawn forced their way into Bivens' home in Bronx and preceded to conduct a thorough and apparently fruitful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.893" offset="354931">They put handcuffs on him in front of his wife and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.695" offset="366111">They took him away to be further questioned and booked as well as subjected to an extremely thorough humiliating search of his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.820" offset="402683">At all times the agents acted without legal authority, without a search or arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.807" offset="426611">After complaint against Bivens was dismissed, (Inaudible) to hire a lawyer, he decided to sue the agents for the outrage he'd suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.400" offset="457017">He knew the US Constitution guaranteed to each citizen the right to be secured against unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.170" offset="484080">He knew that the federal courts had general jurisdiction over cases arising under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.556" offset="505605">He must naively have thought he had a pretty good case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.186" offset="520129">With able assistance of the US Attorneys' Office, the District Court made a short trip to Bivens handwritten compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.301" offset="548551">No statute afforded a remedy against federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.372" offset="560880">In any case, the defendants had acted in their performance of duty, compliant dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.147" offset="580002">Leave to appeal in forma pauperis denied, and the District Court judge's certification that an appeal with frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.268" offset="608423">Fortunately for Bivens, a distinguished judge in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the appeal not so frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.686" offset="642069">Leave was granted and I was assigned counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.645" offset="653981">This time the Department of Justice represented the defendants, arguing with the admirable dexterity that the Fourth Amendment was intended simply to bar the defensive privilege for an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="149.561" offset="701628">Would you keep your voice up a little Mr. Grant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_a_grant" startTime="151.417" stopTime="321.834">
            <label>Mr. Stephen A. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="151.417" offset="709047">Yes, Your Honor, but that the privilege is nevertheless available here because the defendants had acted within the outer perimeter of their line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.261" offset="744364">The Circuit Panel was impressed by the lack of precedent affording a damage remedy and concluded that in enforcing the Fourth Amendment, was the matter for the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.484" offset="785324">It recognized that the privilege question was properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.317" offset="800684">The ruling that Bivens had no cause of action found it unnecessary to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.600" offset="821791">The judgment dismissing the compliant was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.094" offset="839764">The first question, the first issue is whether violation of the constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure gives rise to a federal claim for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.212" offset="888247">The answer turns first in the intent of the framers; second, on the adequacy of existing remedies to fulfill that intent and finally on the role of the court's in enforcing rights secured by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.185" offset="948120">First the intent of the framers; the right of the people to be secured in their person's house, his papers and affects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.061" offset="999633">These words were of course a promise to the people, and an imperative to the executive, but perhaps most important of all to man acutely aware of the problems, practical problems of controlling governmental power, they were special mandate to the judiciary, it stood between the people and their government.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.528" offset="1081448">This is clear from Madison's famous statement that if the Bill of Rights were incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice would consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights, and would resist every encroachment by the legislative or executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.244" offset="1160338">The framers didn't say how the courts would act as guardians.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.055" offset="1175594">How they were to resist the encroachments sooner or later must come, they didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.483" offset="1197328">As the members of this Court well know, the amendment itself was based on one of the great landmarks of English Constitutional Law, Entick against Carrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.266" offset="1240482">The civil action in trespass against the king's messengers for search and seizure conducted under the invalid authority of a general warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.039" offset="1275486">Lord Camden's renowned denunciation of unjustifiable government intrusions in 1765 was well known to the colonists in their struggles against the king's custom officers prior to the revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.851" offset="1326791">There was, as this Court noted several times in a very minds of the framers when they drafted the Fourth Amendment, and with the Entick case in mind, they were no doubt confident that the courts would enforce the constitutional guarantee by the traditional remedy of civil damages.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="321.834" offset="1390738">Mr. Grant, do you know whatever happened to the Bell and Boyd on remand?</text>

            <text syncTime="330.593" offset="1425742">On remand to the District Court, the plaintiff's claim for federal claim was rejected on the merits on the theory that if the agents -- it was either claim against the agent personally, in which case they were immune from suit or if it was a claim against the government, they were also immune under sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.781" offset="1550503">Do you have any comment as to why this issue really comes up only in 1971?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_a_grant" startTime="370.504" stopTime="499.414">
            <label>Mr. Stephen A. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="370.504" offset="1585403">I think that is an extraordinary question and if I could, I would like to reserve that for later, if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.819" offset="1610689">I think that's one of extraordinary questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.131" offset="1631901">Having said this much as to which I believe there is no disagreement, the precise question becomes the presumed intent of framers as to the application of the constitutional guarantee in such a civil damage action, our position is that federal common law is the source of the plaintiff's right that the constitutional guarantee provides a basis in federal law for all subsequent incidents of the suit, including the claim itself whether there's been an unreasonable search and seizure, the measure of damages, and the scope of the officer's defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.702" offset="1790203">In saying this, I rely first and foremost on the language of the Amendment which says that, “the constitutional freedom shall not be violated, speaking in categorical terms of securing the fundamental right and in no way suggesting a more limited application such as merely foreclosing a defense in a suit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.466" offset="1877243">And I rely secondly, on the historical background, on the very fact that the amendment's adoption at a time when everyone knew that common law under Entick against Carrington already protected against unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.085" offset="1939728">The Amendment meant nothing, unless it elevated the common law right to the level of the guarantee that could not negated by the state or even federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.399" offset="1981001">And it meant little as a guarantee of it was merely lofty statement of principle, a right without a remedy, depended on legislative action for its enforcement or was otherwise subject to the vicissitudes of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.845" offset="2038784">How little indeed when we consider that the Congress has enacted in 180 years and under the uncertainties of varying local rules, remedy under state law has become all but completely impotent.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.563" offset="2093641">The Government however argues --</text>

            <text syncTime="499.414" offset="2101060">Mr. Grant when you speak of the vicissitudes of the state laws, as I am not quite sure what that embraces --</text>

            <text syncTime="507.866" offset="2134810">I speak of vicissitudes not in the sense -- vicissitudes in the sense that state law has developed in response to different considerations in the area of trespass and those considerations are more or less developed in all of the 50 States.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.840" offset="2190712">Well, I would -- I would have thought that most of the law of trespass developed in states courts, very little of different in federal courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="531.798" offset="2230523">But it developed with respect to and I think Mr. Justice Harlan pointed this out in Monroe against Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.760" offset="2250376">It developed in a context where the only question was a private right of action against another private citizen and the facts, the measure of recovery particularly, the question whether you could only recover for the damages to -- physical damage to property.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="551.676" stopTime="568.395">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="551.676" offset="2310040">Well, isn't the correct that many states provide by statute for cause of action against official conducts, that is conduct of officials that is not authorized official conduct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen A. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="568.395" offset="2376913">If they do, which I cannot answer when you say is any of the fact because I do not know, but if they do, again, I would rely on the argument that it happens to be a coincidence than which state does and which state doesn't, and what principles govern that cause of action as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.837" offset="2438771">And it's precisely that element of chance and what State you're in and whether state law happens to provide for it, that I don't think a federal right can prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.420" offset="2489031">The Government however, argues that the framers must have been thinking in procedural terms, merely a foreclosing the defense of justification, that the Amendment was intended simply to bar a claim, that an unreasonable search and seizure was justified in the name of the law. The argument is weak at both ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.705" offset="2562173">First it tests too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.802" offset="2570533">In failing to explain how under a long line of decisions upholding constitutional claims in equity, the Amendment could provide the basis for one type of relief but another.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.067" offset="2623613">Emphasis in decisions clearly suggests, an injunction would be available to bar threat in Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.982" offset="2651303">Surely, this must be because the framer's intent in a federal interest goes beyond procedural niceties like foreclosing defenses to the very securing of the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.504" offset="2697383">Yet, how can this interest be sufficient for an injunction and not for damages, particularly under a system of law where equitable relief is the exception rather than the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.343" offset="2740746">On the other hand, the Government's position says too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.382" offset="2756942">For the mere fact, a foreclosing the justification defense, implies an intent on the part of the framers to vindicate the constitutional right by an award of civil damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.836" offset="2802709">Yet, if absent congressional actions state law were intended to govern the plaintiff's claim, then the states we are in are free, not only to leave the right uncertain as it now is but even to oppose affirmative obstacles or bar a civil remedy all together.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.205" offset="3076159">The government's final argument is that the framers cannot have intended to create a federal law -- cause of action because if they had the federal courts would at the outset have been given jurisdictional of the cases arising under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.566" offset="3141674">The logic of this position compels a conclusion that the Congress can similarly not have intended to create any enforceable federal rights on the statutes until 1875, when the original jurisdiction was finally granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.768" offset="3194441">Now obviously, this wasn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.778" offset="3202487">The framers and the Congress assumed that the federal rights would be enforced in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.355" offset="3224743">In the effectiveness of this enforcement of the Fourth Amendment was assured by then accepted omnipresence of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.202" offset="3260165">For when the Amendment was adopted, Entick against Carrington, was assumed to be the common law throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.798" offset="3286601">There can hardly have been any compelling need for original federal jurisdiction and the state courts could be expected to enforce the principles of Entick with the uniformity derived from common custom and tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.352" offset="3336756">Indeed, there was little need to distinguish between state and federal common law rights for well over century afterward, when under the philosophy of Swift against Tyson, the common law was regarded as single and cohesive body of principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.647" offset="3397987">This is why Slocum against Mayberry on which the Government heavily relies for its view, in fact what's precisely the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.422" offset="3429021">If you look at the opinion of the Court, what Chief Justice Marshall did say, was the damages were to be sought in “suit at common law” but that the “common law tribunals of United States” were not available to hear the claim because Congress had not given them jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.483" offset="3505298">He went on to say that the suit had to therefore be brought in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.087" offset="3519718">But contrary to the Government's suggestion, what he did not say, was that, “the claim therefore arose under and was governed by state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.289" offset="3552528">For him and indeed for the courts for many years afterwards such a parochial dissection of the common law was unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.210" offset="3584188">And thus it is that the question of the governing law becomes vital only when the common law becomes what the court said is in fact, when under Erie against Tompkins, the pronouncements of state judges are recognized as binding on the federal courts and when asserting that the claim arises under and is governed by state law may defeat the federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.547" offset="3669556">And in this context, I repeat, in this context, looking at the language and the background of the Fourth Amendment, it's inconceivable that the framers could have intended its enforcement to be subject to compromise under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.781" offset="3726503">And the rights recognized in Entick against Carrington forfeited because of congressional inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.283" offset="3756492">Turning to the second issue, the adequacy of existing remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.457" offset="3785226">From the framer's intent to its fulfillment, it is arguable at least in principle that as a matter of federal law, the Court should look to state law in civil damage actions for unreasonable searches until the Congress says otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.729" offset="3846248">But surely this turns most of all, on whether the framer's intent would thereby be fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.633" offset="3869863">The court below concluded that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.164" offset="3879999">The plaintiff should be left to sue under the state law because the existing remedies substantially vindicate Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.454" offset="3909151">With due respect this conclusion cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.709" offset="3922213">It flies in the face of this Court's decision in Mapp against Ohio and Monroe against Pape, both of which required overriding substantial state interests because I said in the Mapp, existing civil remedies under state law were worthless and futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.412" offset="3993057">Moreover, given federal rules under the Civil Rights Act against state officers and the variety in local rules, and this is the point in response to your question Mr. Chief Justice, the variety in local rules from state to state, it means that identical conduct and unreasonable search and seizure will give rise to liability, if committed by a state but not a federal officer and if committed in one jurisdiction but not in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.814" offset="4102666">At least enforcement of Fourth Amendment rights, subject to the accidents of which badge the defendant is wearing and on which side of a particular state boundary he happens to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.901" offset="4146970">And in terms of the larger question of the detouring police misconduct, the lower court's conclusion cannot be reconciled with the results of more detailed studies but scholar in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.375" offset="4192841">The most extensive worked today which no doubt the members of the Court have seen is that Professor Oaks of the University of Chicago Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.442" offset="4225128">His recently published article is cited on page 31 of the under the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.185" offset="4244146">He concludes that the Exclusionary Rule has a as relatively little impact as a deterrent to police misconduct, as most police activity is directed not at securing evidence for prosecution, but apprehending criminals and maintaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.759" offset="4302451">More important, he sights evidence in Canada that suggests that a civil remedy is reasonably effective in curbing the police and strongly urges that such a remedy be given a chance to do job here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.062" offset="4367653">Turning finally to the role of the courts; what is the responsibility of the courts when a aggrieved citizen in this theory to vindicate a claim based on the naked violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.682" offset="4426062">Of course, the Government executive insists that Court shouldn't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.044" offset="4451558">They argue and I quote, “that there must be showing of utmost necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.088" offset="4467754">It must be vital, indispensable, essential, and absolutely necessary and having themselves so restrictively set the stage and the question to be so decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.608" offset="4513834">They proceed to argue that ineffectual state remedies are nonetheless not totally worthless that the matter should be left to a Congress that hasn't enacted in 180 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.091" offset="4551764">To all this I would say only three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.397" offset="4564929">First, if indeed necessity must be shown for the courts to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.304" offset="4580603">It is here as plaintiffs anything can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.858" offset="4594813">If the need to protect Fourth Amendment rights requires the courts to suppress reliable evidence in criminal prosecutions at the expense of the society, surely it provides a basis for a civil tort remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.702" offset="4646222">It would be available to the innocent and the guilty alike and place the burden on the irresponsible police officer where it more properly belong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.575" offset="5509622">Now that the issue is finally in front of this Court, they say that the same complaint preliminary papers afford insufficient facts to -- for an informed judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.328" offset="5832704">First of all, we do not contend that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under Section 1331 (a) in the sense of Bell v. Hood for a cause of action as stated on one construction of the Constitution and defeated on another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.161" offset="5899995">The critical question here and the one left undecided in Bell and Hood by this Court, is recognizing that the complaint on its face for pleading purposes states an actionable tort under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.388" offset="5956942">Should it also be read as giving rise to a constitutional tort, so that the elements of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.540" offset="5985573">That is the type of injuries compensable and the kinds of damages recoverable should be governed by federally created law. Our answer is no, basically, because of lack of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.591" offset="6049729">Indeed the tort remedy as I would suggest a little later in the argument is basically ineffectual as most of the commentators have suggested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.124" offset="7451878">For example, as to a federal officer, the law is not clear and I think it looks the other way, the state cannot enjoin the federal law officer, at least Professor Warren thinks that, and you've suggested that in Wheeler and Wheeldin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.681" offset="7502137">So, there is no remedy with regard in a state court with regard to a federal officer in terms of injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.197" offset="7616136">Clearly here, there is a remedy in damages in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.769" offset="7630451">It seems to me its petitioner's burden to show there was necessity to create a damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.078" offset="7651662">It is our position and the position of those who have -- the commentators who have dealt with this matter in complete detail that the difficulties with regard to the damage action do not lie in the vagaries of state law as is alleged here by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.767" offset="7718431">Essentially, the fact of the matter is that the hesitancy of those who have been arrested to sue the police and if they do sue the undeniable fact that juries are reluctant to hold federal or a state officers personally responsible in damages at the request of one who may have a criminal record or comes from the lowest economic levels of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.353" offset="7808815">It seems to us as the writers have pointed out that other remedy should be sought perhaps against the police entity in terms of governmental liability, amending the Tort Claims Act perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.640" offset="11297938">The record I think is, in our judgment, is wholly inadequate to permit an informed judgment as to whether the agents were acting within the scope of their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.767" offset="12166457">I'll make only a few remarks unless there are questions from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.486" offset="12177324">First, when you ask whether -- if state law governs this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.021" offset="12195506">If state law governs this claim, we go back to the District Court we are out of the Court if Mr. Feit is correct in saying the state statute of limitations bars a suit.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3032.664" stopTime="3033.817">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3032.664" offset="12234062">Because of the statute limitations, correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_a_grant" startTime="3033.817" stopTime="3303.478">
            <label>Mr. Stephen A. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="3033.817" offset="12238660">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.449" offset="12241168">Because I think we brought it two years after the trespass and that's precisely the kind of question that and there are obviously, others issues beside the damages that would bear on the federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.911" offset="12294980">What is required here is not as the Government so strongly suggests creating a new cause of action, in the sense of defining a new and certainly not a constitutional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.184" offset="12340120">Here, unlike Wheeldin against Wheeler, we already have in the Constitution of prescription against an unreasonable search and seizure and the tort of trespass is as old any of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.248" offset="12392364">This Court is asked to hold nothing more than in such a time honored claim on trespass is governed by federal law when based on a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.452" offset="12437191">And what is required would not, again, as the Government suggests, freeze Fourth Amendment remedies in a mold that can only be broken by a constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.664" offset="12478046">What we are talking about is not redefining the Fourth Amendment but about its enforcement being a matter of federal common law free from local rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.308" offset="12516603">Such common law could consistent with the Amendment be changed by legislative action and even if the right to damages where called the constitutional right, there's nothing to prevent the Congress from acquiring a claim to be asserted against the Government itself or providing for indemnity for its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.921" offset="12591104">Finally, what we are asking would not has worried the Court below, lead down a long and uncertain road in creating federal rules or even open a Pandora's Box of civil litigation to vindicate constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.142" offset="12663933">The Courts and particularly the federal court's responsibility to formulate federal rules and to determine the difficult question which constitutional violations give rise to damage claims is already present under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.413" offset="12725060">Recognizing the federal nature of the plaintiff's claim here would be, if the Courts later so wished an easily distinguished decision resting as it must, not merely on the face of the Fourth Amendment but on the specific intent of the framers and on the background of common law that imposed personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.846" offset="12810742">In concluding, I would like to return of the question raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun to a thought that I suggested at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.559" offset="12845641">For me its extra ordinary that the fundamental questions in this case raised with this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.329" offset="12872704">Over 200 years after, they were settled in England in Entick against Carrington, in 180 years after the framers attempted to incorporate the promise of Entick into the Fourth Amendment and as I said, 25 years after this Court so pointedly suggested the availability of a federal claim and Bell against Hood, the explanation, as the Courts know too well, does not lie in any dearth of unreasonable searches and seizures, such abuses continue, and apparently unabated by judicial suppression of the legally seized evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.742" offset="13026304">Obviously, there is something fundamentally wrong in the understanding of the people and of the police as to the meaning of the Fourth Amendment that it is in a practical sense a guarantee that can, and will be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.520" offset="13089416">If there's to be a change, it will not come from simply sustaining the right to sue in federal court and as the Government points out in its brief the Civil Right Act was recognize over 10 years ago, and yet the use of the Civil Rights Act remedy has been minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.859" offset="13162768">Stronger medicine is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.424" offset="13173112">A reaffirmation of the citizens right under federal law and the Government's liability in clear and resounding terms that will be heard and understood by the people and by the police and from where would it come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.317" offset="13244688">From a Congress that recently authorized no knock entry by the police, clearly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.169" offset="13276035">It will be from this Court or not at all and looking at the 25 years between Bell against Hood today, it would now a very possibly never or no time.</text>
