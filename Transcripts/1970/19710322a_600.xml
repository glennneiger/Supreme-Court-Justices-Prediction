            <label>Mr. Albert J. Krieger</label>
            <text syncTime="14.497" offset="161311">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.675" offset="178030">In considering the constitutionality of Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, what has been popularly called the Federal Anti-loan Sharking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.852" offset="230797">We respectfully submit that the real question posed is whether Congress may constitutionally enact a general extortion statute because in truth and in fact, the statute enacted by Congress does not reach in the true sense the crime of loan sharking.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.105" offset="339780">Loan sharking, if we follow the definition of that crime as testified to at the hearings before Congress is a lending at a usurious rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.256" offset="412400">This statute does not include anywhere within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.943" offset="439150">Those activities as a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.437" offset="457122">That which it makes criminal is extortion and extortion of the broadest tribe covering the myriad extortionate activities to which criminals may resort in our varied society.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.659" offset="534026">Even though, the statute continually refers to the term, the phrase, extension of credit, extension of credit as defined by the statute refers not only to a debt but to a claim, be that claim valid or invalid, acknowledged or not, disputed or not, however arising, so long as the satisfaction of that claim is deferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.011" offset="679372">The hearings before Congress certainly disclosed and it may well be assumed that organized crime is intestate in character and that organized crime may have as one of its substantial sources of revenue, loan sharking, that is the lending of money at usurious rates of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.401" offset="785011">But there is nothing within the proceedings had before Congress which would warrant the broad and sweeping finding that extortion per se is a crime which belongs in a federal lexicon.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.144" offset="859930">The types of extortion covered here may well include the incidental extortion to which a loan shark may resort in seeking collection of a debt, of a lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.237" offset="932342">It may also include an irate wage earner going to his employer and demanding wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.616" offset="977795">It may include an irate motorist after a collision saying to another driver, “You will pay me for this damage, one way or the other and by the end of the week.”</text>
            <text syncTime="232.887" offset="1034951">These are all included within what we contend as any reasonable reading of the definition extension of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.584" offset="1093674">Certainly, and we concede, there are times when extortionate means are employed by loan sharks but what Congress has done here is because organized crime may be well involved in loan sharking and loan sharking at some time may involve extortion, then all extortion regardless of how it arises becomes a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.146" offset="1248005">We respectfully submit that such a statute is a classic case of overkill.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.544" offset="1281546">Certainly, Congress may legislate against the crime of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.042" offset="1299519">Congress has done so in 1951, 1952, the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.658" offset="1325955">Congress may broaden what it includes as a federal offense in extortion, so long as that extortion may reasonably be connected with a federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.880" offset="1386872">The federal interest however, between extortion generally, extortion generally appears to be lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.124" offset="1439848">The federal interest connection to extortion generally appears to be lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.500" offset="1457403">Certainly, it did not appear within the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.706" offset="1474226">The hearings were directed at a specific definable class of activity. Congress, in seeking to legislate against an organized crime activity enacted the statute and Congress stated that the purpose of this statute is to strike at the second most lucrative source of revenue for organized crime loan sharking.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.117" offset="1583835">There is nothing within the proceedings before Congress which characterized extortion as a uniquely organized crime activity or that extortion per se is a lucrative source of funds for organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.272" offset="1680488">The federal pay for the general extortion statute is lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.275" offset="1712462">There is no definable class of activity or activities whose very nature might compel the finding of the federal interest, all of the current gambling statute, where Congress instead of making all gambling illegal said gambling of a certain type has characteristics which compel the finding of the federal interest such as it must involve -- the gambling activity must involve five or more people deal in an amount in excess of $2,000.00 on a daily rate or be an activity which is continued for 30 days or more and that the gambling activity be the business of the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.857" offset="1938787">Here, any, if I may say occasional extortioner, finds himself fully within the purview of the statute even if his activity is totally unrelated to loan sharking, the vice which Congress was seeking to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.820" offset="2038680">It is our contention that the means that Congress has selected to control loan sharking, these means are far too broad, far too inclusive and exceeds the authority of Congress both under the Interstate Commerce clause and under the Bankruptcy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.945" offset="2135124">We believe and we do not argue here that every specific criminal statute requires a recitation that there must be proved to a jury, an interstate activity or that an interstate facility was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.953" offset="2223208">We do believe however, that in a criminal statute there must be a showing of the trial level if not of the interstate activity itself or the use of the interstate facility but such a state of facts as warrant the conclusion that the federal interest is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.770" offset="2330415">The underlying facts in this case Mr. Justice Harlan are that in a local butcher’s store in Brooklyn, Mr. Miranda was the owner of the local butcher’s store in Brooklyn, that he needed some revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.899" offset="2402931">He was not able to obtain monies through the usual sources and through a friend was introduced to a petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.283" offset="2432502">The petitioner loaned him some money at a usurious rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.136" offset="2459878">Eventually the -- Mr. Miranda was unable to repay, a new loans worked out, again at usurious rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.070" offset="2511600">Mr. Miranda was again unable to repay and finally extortionate threats were made to Mr. Miranda to attempt to effect repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.772" offset="2570428">There were no interstate facilities used.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.721" offset="2586206">This all involved a transaction occurring in Brooklyn, New York in the Williamsburg section.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="628.567" offset="2617657">But it is conceded that run of the mill extortion was exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.022" offset="2651512">And threat remained -- I take it from your statement just now this is conceded.</text>

          <turn speaker="albert_j_krieger" startTime="641.281" stopTime="773.189">
            <label>Mr. Albert J. Krieger</label>
            <text syncTime="641.281" offset="2668544">Oh, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.955" offset="2675231">There was extortion under the proof in this case, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.458" offset="2713161">But we feel that the fact of extortion in this case still does not make the extortion as committed by the defendant here a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.307" offset="2772616">The only way this extortion could become a federal offense is if a general extortion statute were part of a Federal Criminal Code and that is basically what the Consumer Credit Protection Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.045" offset="2847535">If the intent of Congress were carried out, it is perhaps quite possible that Mr. Perez’s activities would fall within a loan sharking definition that would be constitutionally acceptable but we are dealing not with such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.185" offset="2952129">I repeat we’re dealing with a general extortion statute and regardless of the constant reference to this statute as a loan sharking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.870" offset="2986820">A loan sharking statute, its basic nature is not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.017" offset="3007404">The Congress in the proposed new Federal Criminal Code treated the loan sharking statute anew, and here they faced up to the problem because there was a recognition in the commentary that such jurisdiction referring to this plenary jurisdiction over extortionate activity may well be over broad and they recognized also apparently that the statute -- the current statute was an extortion statute and they rewrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.189" offset="3196113">What’s the constitutional difference between a loan sharking statute as we call it means to say that it would be alright, it might be alright and this statute will not be --</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert J. Krieger</label>
            <text syncTime="784.053" offset="3239581">I would say that the Constitutional difference sir, is that this statute just generally with an enormous vacuum cleaner type of facts sweeps in every type of extortionate activity be at intrastate, be at interstate, be it connected with federal interest, be it not connected with the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.519" offset="3337488">A loan sharking statute such as the one that appears in Section 1771 of the proposed code defines a class of activity, thereby limiting the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.993" offset="3419303">It legislates against loan sharking as a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.873" offset="3442813">It implants definitions of the business, the character of the business and the nature of the business connects it with organized crime activity, so that the casual lender just as the casual gambler is omitted from the impact of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.570" offset="3533615">I think that we are basically dealing sir, with matters of definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.933" offset="3551065">How far out may Congress reach in legislating against what might well be an interstate evil?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.140" offset="3599966">This is basically, I submit, a matter of scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.193" offset="3624103">It is true that extortion within the loan shark gambit may be reached but may extortion unrelated to the loan sharking activity be reached also.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.698" offset="7342164">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.089" offset="7375705">The decision there was a divided one with judges Feinberg and Waterman in the majority and Judge Hayes writing a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.517" offset="7425442">The question is solely a constitutional one and no question with respect to the construction of the statute or the weight or application of the evidence is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.985" offset="7479359">And the question is whether Title II of the Consumer Protection Act enacted in 1968 as a part of the Truth in Lending Act whether that is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.610" offset="7537768">And specifically Section 894 which is set forth on Page 5 of the Government’s brief which is the statute under which the defendant was indicted and convicted provides that whoever knowingly participates in any way or conspires to do so and no conspiracies involved here in the use of any extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit or to punish any person for the non-repayment thereof shall be fined not more than $10,000.00 or imprisoned no more than 20 years or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.260" offset="7720417">Now in addition to that, there is included in the statute, specific findings by Congress and these are set forth on Pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.266" offset="7776423">They are the result of extensive consideration and hearings in Congress and by other agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.247" offset="8216325">One, organized crime is interstate and international in character and skipping to the end of that paragraph is substantial part of the income of organized crime is generated by extortionate credit transactions and then extortionate credit transactions are characterized by the use or the expressed or implicit threat or the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation or property as a means of enforcing payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.279" offset="8476505">And extortionate credit transactions directly impair the effectiveness and frustrate to purposes of the laws enacted by Congress on the subject of bankruptcies and on the basis of these findings the Congress determines that the provisions of the statute including that involved here are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of Congress to regulate commerce and establish uniform and effective laws on the subject of bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.029" offset="10411447">As I have been working on this case, I found myself repeatedly with the feeling that I have heard this record before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.455" offset="10441226">By that I don’t mean that this is an easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.569" offset="10453661">It obviously presents a problem in federalism but I think it can fairly be called a problem in constructive or creative federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.750" offset="10494412">Indeed, has that not been the history of this Court’s decisions under the Commerce Clause beginning with Gibbons and Ogden, a 140 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.717" offset="10546239">It’s true that there was a time when the Court took a rather narrow view of the commerce clause as in Hammer and Dagenhart and in Carter against The Carter Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.978" offset="10591274">But those decisions did not stand the test of time and have been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.283" offset="10612485">In many other cases it has often been urged on the Court, often by distinguished counsel that particular actions taken by Congress extended unduly the line circumscribing federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.304" offset="10672567">And none of these cases was easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.133" offset="10683956">But again and again the Court has upheld the exercise of federal power under the Commerce Clause and as time goes on it becomes clearer and clearer in the view of history that these decisions have been sound and have indeed contributed to the working of an effective federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.600" offset="10761801">And I refer to the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act and many others which have been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.442" offset="10797119">Nearly 50 years ago, in 1922 then Professor Philip Frankfurter wrote the decisions under the Commerce Clause either allowing or confining state action are at bottom, acts of statesmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.693" offset="10870157">And he quoted a passage from an article which he had just been published in 1922 by Thomas Repole, the Dean of the Columbia law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.891" offset="10910908">Professor Repole said, “The Court has drawn its lines where it has drawn them because it has thought it wise to draw them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.147" offset="10951973">The wisdom of its wisdom depends upon a judgment about practical matters and not upon the knowledge of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.571" offset="10989693">And another passage to which I would like to refer in the general portion of my argument comes from a decision of this Court more than 25 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.917" offset="11043088">The interpenetrations of modern society have not wiped out state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.598" offset="11065762">It is not for us to make inroads upon our federal system either by indifference to its maintenance or excessive regard for the unifying forces of modern technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.035" offset="11111528">Scholastic reasoning may prove that no activity is isolated within the boundaries of a single state but that cannot justify absorption of legislative power by the United States over every activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.220" offset="11172237">On the other hand, the old admonition never becomes still, that this Court is concerned with the bounds of legal power and not with the bounds of wisdom in its exercise by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.731" offset="11226258">When the conduct of an enterprise affects commerce among the states is a matter of practical judgment not to be determined by abstract notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.038" offset="11267532">The exercise of this practical judgment, the constitution entrusts primarily and very largely to Congress subject to the ladders controlled by the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.164" offset="11316015">Great power was thus given to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.747" offset="11330330">The power of legislation and thereby the power of passing judgment upon the needs of a complex society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.304" offset="11360632">Strictly confined though, far reaching power was given to this Court, that in determining whether the Congress has exceeded limits allowable and reason for the judgment which it has exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.391" offset="11412982">To hold that to effect what meant a practical affairs would call Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.772" offset="11434506">And to deem them related to such commerce merely by gossamer threats and not by solid ties would be to disrespect the judgment that is open to men who have the constitutional power and responsibility to legislate for the nation and that comes from this Court’s opinion in Polish National Alliance against the National Labor Relation Board decided in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.369" offset="11548818">I know of no decision of this Court which as a precedent, clearly requires a decision in favor of the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.225" offset="11596257">But the problem here is thoroughly boxed in by many decisions which are now an established part of the Court’s jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.490" offset="11641292">Perhaps the closest and most important is a decision of more than 50 years ago, the great opinion by Justice Hughes in the Shreveport case in 234 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.785" offset="11702523">The statue involved in that case was in general terms without any reference to or limitation to acts burdening or affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.728" offset="11750275">The Congress provided that -- and I am quoting from page 355 and 356 of the opinion in this report case, “that it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality in any respect whatsoever or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.232" offset="11884335">And there’s no limitation in that statute with respect to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.383" offset="11904920">And the Court will recall that Shreveport case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.336" offset="11920697">The Court held that the statute was broad enough to apply to discrimination in intrastate commerce and that the Congress had the constitutional power to enact that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.098" offset="11991751">We come good many years later to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.767" offset="12026441">The first great decision there was the National Labor Relations Board against Jones and Laughlin Steel Company in 301 U.S, that statute by its terms is applicable to manufacturing but it refers to matters which are in commerce or affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.630" offset="12145873">Thus, it is a statute which is worded somewhat differently than the one here but the language of the Court is instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.037" offset="12211493">On page 37 of 301 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.951" offset="12227166">Undoubtedly, the scope of this power must be considered in the light of our dual system of Government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them in view of our complex society would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.902" offset="12331029">And we of course make no contention for anything of that sort here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.715" offset="12362271">We make no suggestion that as my opponent has said that all extortion would be subject to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.659" offset="12413994">The only extortion which is involved here is with respect to credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.340" offset="12448684">There are other powers besides the commerce power and the bankruptcy power which involved credit, the power for example, to coin money and regulate the value thereof is the foundation for the whole national bank system, the Federal Reserve System and indeed for the publicity provisions of the Truth in Lending Act of which this statute is a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.298" offset="12552547">We all know the elementary economics, from elementary economics, the effect of credit on the money supply and certainly that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.883" offset="12606882">Now, the next case to which I would refer is United States against Darby in 312 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.451" offset="12641155">Which was a criminal case incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.482" offset="12649305">I don’t make anything of the point that Judge Hayes did in dissent that this was a criminal statute and of course criminal statutes must be carefully and narrowly construed but no question of construction is raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.592" offset="12709700">If Congress has power in this area, I have no doubt that it has power to exercise, to impose a criminal sanction as well as a penalty which was involved in Wickard and Filburn or regulation as was involved in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.998" offset="12779395">But the United States against Darby was a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.125" offset="12799875">It is applicable to goods by its term to people who are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.550" offset="12841566">But that has been broadly extended in recent years and for example there isn’t the slightest doubt that Mr. Miranda, if he had been successful in operating his butcher shop would have been subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act or could have been made subject to it and also to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.309" offset="13704652">And it is not involved here, and I think that the factual basis for saying that loan sharking has an important bearing on commerce is a strong one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.838" offset="13830771">Mr. Justice, I think that would under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.571" offset="13849684">That would be a very much harder case than this but on such a matter a case like Wickard v. Filburn seems to be to very instructive and you recall will that that involves the growing of 239 bushels of wheat on an intrastate farm in the center of the state which wheat was as all consumed on that farm and the Court held that penalty provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act were valid and applicable to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.195" offset="13992103">It was argued that what was involved was farming and not commerce but the Court -- there is a particular passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.574" offset="14077680">But even this is on page 125, but even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still whatever its nature be reached by Congress, if it exerts a substantial economic effect on Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.531" offset="14165452">And this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as direct or indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.908" offset="14202964">And there the 239 bushels of wheat were founded to exert an adequate effect on commerce to sustain the exercise of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.680" offset="14246118">And I’m quite willing to stand on the proposition that if it can be shown on facts put before Congress, that grand larceny has a substantial deterring effect on commerce that Congress, if in its judgment it decided that it was the appropriate thing for Congress to do would have that power and it should be sustained by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.273" offset="14364505">But I repeat that that is not before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.848" offset="14378715">What we have here is loan sharking and which there is a large mass of material to support the proposition that it has an important bearing on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.762" offset="14430438">And then I would refer to the case of Katzenbach against McClung and Heart of Atlanta Motel against United States where the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or 1965 was held to be applicable against a local motel in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.610" offset="14525837">There, the statute refers to transient guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.453" offset="14537226">It says nothing about guests moving in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.331" offset="14552691">The transient guest might all have been within Georgia as far as the statutory language is concerned there but the Court found no difficulty with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.218" offset="14588217">And in Katzenbach against McClung, the statute did provide that it served interstate travelers or that a substantial portion of the food moved in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.531" offset="14637537">The last case which seems to me to be very strong in this area is Maryland against Wirtz where the Court held that the Fair Labor Standard Act could be applied to all employees of a business even though those employees were not engaged in commerce if any of the employees were engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.262" offset="14720397">If I may Mr. Chief Justice, I’d like to make reference just to one case cited in the reply brief of the defendant United States against Denmark which he says controls this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.836" offset="14778702">That is a case 27 years ago where there was no opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.022" offset="14807437">It’s rather refreshing to see that these things happened in other times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.702" offset="14834186">Three justices held that a statute with respect to the registration of gambling equipment should not be construed to apply to the registration of intrastate gambling devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.970" offset="14887267">Two justices, Justices Black and Douglas, the only two of that Court who are still here held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague so that there were five votes against sustaining the conviction and four justices held that the statute should be construed to apply and was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.724" offset="14974307">It’s clear that there’s no judgment or opinion in that case which is authoritative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.709" offset="15006177">And this case, our submission is that this statue adequately based on findings of fact made by Congress after full and careful consideration of a difficult national problem though not squarely supported by any prior case, is but to stop on all sides by firm decisions of this Court and that the decision below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3770.945" offset="15187153">I would like to correct one impression and that is this apparent concession of mine that the activities of Mr. Perez would be subject to a federal proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.727" offset="15262281">I do not intend such concession and I’m intended to say that perhaps Congress can enact the statute which upon the addition of other fact that is not present in this case could reach specific loan sharking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.487" offset="15353292">The case as it has come here affecting the specific type of transaction in which Mr. Perez engaged, I think is beyond the reach of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.427" offset="15409089">It cannot be the subject of a congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.416" offset="15445034">I think that all necessary points have been covered Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3839.093" offset="15459767">Mr. Krieger if all of the small businessmen of this category were proud of the business as he was obviously the big market business would go to the large operators on the supermarkets who do not have the difficulty, same difficulty in getting financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.226" offset="15580244">Would you say that that is not enough impact on commerce, potential impact on commerce to warrant federal legislation in the field?</text>

            <text syncTime="3882.873" offset="15634892">Well I think that that would cover a host of -- that the same reasoning could be applied to a host of other activities to pick up the instance which Mr. Justice Stewart gave in regard to larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.270" offset="15688495">Certainly, any crime which affects the economic stability of a business then would be subject to federal legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3906.676" offset="15730082">That that sort of larceny has a different impact on the large supermarket than it does on a small independent marginal businessmen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3925.581" offset="15805733">If Mr. Perez’s cash box -- if Mr. Miranda’s cash box was riffled by a thief, he might well not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.932" offset="15843140">I think that the test is not whether -- the test is not that the criminal activity may result in the extermination of a small businessman because once we apply that test I think we have opened the flood gates to every type of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.553" offset="15961631">If the man did not carry automobile insurance and he was in an accident and was compelled to pay a heavy judgment.</text>
