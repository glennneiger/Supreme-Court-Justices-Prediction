            <text syncTime="35.487" offset="245321">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.772" offset="258487">This case here on the writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit presents an important question as to the evidence that maybe utilized by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare in disability proceedings under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.932" offset="319091">Specifically, the question is the correctness of a ruling by the Court of Appeals that written reports made by doctors found the examination of the patient which reflect the results of the examination and the doctor’s analysis and conclusions based upon that examination cannot constitute substantial evidence to support a determination of disability if, one, at the hearing before the social security authorities, the claimant objects to the introduction of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.202" offset="472168">And two, if these written doctor’s reports are contradicted by oral testimony given at the hearing by the claimant and the claimant’s doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.936" offset="519084">The Government has brought this case to this Court because of the serious adverse impact, it believes this rule announced by the Court of Appeals will have upon the operation of the entire social security disability program.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.078" offset="591705">There's a tremendous number of these administrative hearings conducted each year in disability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.538" offset="625560">Last year, our figure showed that 27,000 of these hearings were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.120" offset="655862">The hearings are conducted quite informally, they are not adversary in characters, we know the term and the examiner who presides is not an advocate of one position or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.415" offset="705076">He attempts to develop all the facts, both those indicating disability and both -- and those questioning disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.226" offset="740289">Now, for as long as this program has been in effect for at least 15-years, traditionally these cases have been determined on the basis of medical reports, written reports --</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="177.846" offset="814791">Well let me start by explaining what happened perhaps in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.626" offset="829837">This man filed a claim for disability in April 1966, in which he claimed that he had become disabled in September of 1965 as a result of a back injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.488" offset="893367">Before he had actually filed his claim, he had undergone some treatment which had been unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.742" offset="922311">And when he flied his claim, under the procedures of statutory procedures, the claim was referred by the social security agency to the state agency that handles disability problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.344" offset="972779">In this case the Texas Agency and under the statute, the statute authorizes the secretary to enter into agreements with state agencies to handle, to process these claims originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.783" offset="1022516">The state agency then --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="231.599" offset="1029726">And in the procedures by which they’re handled differed depending upon the state?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="237.348" stopTime="289.040">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="237.348" offset="1052714">Well, they may vary some but the basic procedure I think is the same which is the state agency makes whatever examinations are necessary at -- the Federal Government pays for these but it sends the man out for medical examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.383" offset="1112900">In this case, there were a series of examinations by four different doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.161" offset="1132022">First, they sent the man to an orthopedic surgeon who conducted various tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.949" offset="1151143">Then they sent him to a neurologist, following that they also had -- I might mention before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.684" offset="1182072">They also attached to his applications were various reports from his doctors who had indicated the problems they saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.750" offset="1214360">And at an early stage -- at an earlier stage before he filed his claim, he had undergone surgery, something called a laminectomy for this pain he had at his lower back.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.679" offset="1318118">He was twice hospitalized by the orthopedic surgeon then the laminectomy was performed and following this, he went from seeing the orthopedic surgeon he consulted.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.010" offset="1463463">Well they didn’t find much they thought, and this is one of the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.677" offset="1478092">They found some pressure and they did prescribed certain procedures but they did not find any specific neurological involvement of the kind that they believe would cause this pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.313" offset="1536606">Before the operation, before the operation the neurologist Dr. Munslow believed there was some problem with the disc but apparently the laminectomy did not disclose that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.462" offset="1629184">Well there was enough there apparently to suggest that they performed two myelograms before the surgery and the first one is not on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.185" offset="1668159">The second one suggested some disc involvement but apparently after the surgery was performed, they did not find anything which indicated the disc involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.830" offset="1710686">And after that, the man put himself under the care of Dr. Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.843" offset="1742764">A family doctor who treated him more conservatively with such things as he gave him some x-ray, not x-ray DP therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.209" offset="1780172">He gave him drugs, he gave him pain killers, some minor, slight exercise and so but none of these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.419" offset="1813086">These treatment apparently alleviated his pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.643" offset="1829909">So, if I may just go back a minute to what happened in the case after the state agency has examined the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.052" offset="1863555">The state agency then initially at least decided that he was not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.155" offset="1895946">And subsequent to that, he then said he wished to appeal this to the social security administration after the state agency makes the initial determination which they’re permitted to do under the stature of the cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.401" offset="3724936">Then under the practice, Perales brought a suit in the District Court to set aside the determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.230" offset="3888253">The District Court said that the statements and the written reports of the medical advisers were not substantial evidence and that the testimony of the medical adviser was of little or no probative value.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.313" offset="3940603">And therefore the District Court remanded the case to the secretary to hold a new hearing before a different examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.025" offset="3971427">He said that this examiner was out because -- the District Judge a month before this hearing had condemned the use of these medical reports and despite that this examiner had admitted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.053" offset="4011551">And so he said there had to be before a new hearing and the indication clearly was at the new hearing, only the doctor's testimony would be permitted, not the reports unless the parties agreed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.067" offset="4059617">Now, the Fifth Circuit affirmed and what the Fifth Circuit said basically, I think four things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.429" offset="4129102">That the medical reports although hearsay were admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.349" offset="4144776">That was the first thing the Court of Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.886" offset="4154911">Secondly the Court of Appeals said that since under the regulations, a claimant has the right to request to subpoena witnesses and since Perales had never sought to subpoena the doctors, he could not complain that he was denied the right to cross examine the doctors because he hadn’t sought to attempt to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.855" offset="4318751">For example, he would say that you just can't tell on the basis of these tests alone what his condition is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.855" offset="4346755">That the significance of the test depends upon the circumstances under which they were done, how long you lapsed etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.878" offset="4378833">But they will not permit, they will not permit into subpoena a doctor merely because he says he wants to cross examine them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.713" offset="4526268">The Court also said that it agreed that the medical adviser had properly been permitted to testify that once again, his testimony was properly admitted even though he said it was hearsay because it was built and turned on the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.086" offset="4591679">But the Court then went on and criticized what it said was in view as the widespread practice of these medical advisers that called writing the circuit with the examiners for the purpose of reporting on the condition on the basis of the reports and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.376" offset="4656880">And what the Court said is that this procedure should be frowned upon if not eliminated entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.174" offset="4684048">Now, and that therefore affirmed the Districts Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.076" offset="4699721">I want to stress on that before getting into the discussion of the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.645" offset="4721977">That neither Court in this case has yet passed upon the question whether or not the secretary correctly held that Perales was not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.474" offset="4765236">All they have said was the evidence upon which the secretary based its decision was not substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.455" offset="4797210">We don’t know in this case, we don’t know in this case what the ultimate outcome will be and if the Court agrees with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.202" offset="4828139">That the Court of Appeals applied the wrong stand, all that we ask is the case be sent back to the District Court for the District Court now to review the substantiality of the evidence upon which the secretary based his determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.536" offset="4885504">I make this point because some of the amici in their briefs are complaining that this man wasn’t disabled and that on this evidence you have to conclude that he was not disabled because this test were basically unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.616" offset="4937853">That is an issue that has not been passed upon by either of the two lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.567" offset="4957602">Now I would like if I may just briefly to indicate the importance of the issue before coming to the discussion as to the question on the substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.826" offset="5006712">As I'd indicated earlier in my argument there are about 20,000 -- 27,000 last year of these hearings held annually and since the program has been in effect, they have always relied on these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.741" offset="5058330">Now, the doctors have been very cooperative in these cases, they have been quite willing to examine the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.346" offset="5092707">Presumably knowing that it's only going to be in the unusual case when they will be asked to testify and the secretary has some information which we have set forth in our brief that if this rule obtains and if as the necessary result, there going to be have to be a great deal more testifying by the doctors and that a lot of doctors who have headed to, been willing to conduct these examinations are going to be very, very reluctant to do so because they know they examine a man and spend an hour or two making tests on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.774" offset="5218513">And so the end result of this maybe that several months later they will find themselves forced to attend a hearing at some distant place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.411" offset="5249024">Perhaps have to sit for a whole day giving -- listening to the testimony, then giving their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.402" offset="5277027">Now not only will this make and this reluctance on the part of doctors to conduct these examinations would have two unfortunate consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.883" offset="5314853">First, you make it more difficult for the secretary to determine this vast number of claims and secondly in the long run we think it would re-down to the detriment of the claimants themselves because the majority of these cases in which claims are made following these examinations, the claim is allowed and figures out roughly two thirds of all claims are allowed without ever going to hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.668" offset="5406072">So that the claimants themselves might be handicapped if the doctors would generally unwilling and reluctant to conduct these examinations and finally we read in the papers all the time about the critical shortage of physicians in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.135" offset="5467930">I think 50,000 more are needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.740" offset="5478379">We have doctors working 50 and 60 hours a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.466" offset="5489246">They don’t have enough time to see patients and as I will now develop, I think -- we think these reports are thoroughly reliable and that really it would not be in the public interest that the doctors should spend a substantial portion of their time particularly, the specialist who are I presume, even in more critical short supply testifying at these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.499" offset="5589347">Now in the Social Security Act, Congress has provided a very flexible procedure for for the conduct of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.182" offset="5624142">I might just mention one further point in passing, now that flexibility which has characterized these proceedings for many years would be substantially weakened we think, if everything had to be this formal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.415" offset="5677014">If you had to have every time a doctor’s report was to be offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.945" offset="5703137">If he had to be called as a witness, whenever the claimant and the claimant’s doctor appeared and then normally of course, in every case, the claimant appears and I would assume this got to be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.531" offset="5741484">The normal practice would be that the claimant would always have his physician who would testify and then it would be necessary to call all of these doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.337" offset="5772727">The statute gives the secretary authority to provide for the nature in extent of the proofs and evidence and the method for taking and furnishing such proof and evidence in disability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.669" offset="5822046">And the secretary in turn of his regulations leave it to the examiner generally to determine the procedure at the hearings provided that the procedure will afford the parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.134" offset="5879933">And as I've indicated, the statute expressly says evidence maybe received even though inadmissible in the Court of law under traditional rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.189" offset="5916087">And of course finally, the secretary’s findings if they are supported by substantial evidence are stated by the statute to be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.288" offset="5956524">Now, substantial evidence as this Court has said on many occasions that it's sufficient to support an administrative determination is evidence from which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.900" offset="6019009">Evidence as it stated otherwise, it has rational probative force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.230" offset="6036250">And we think under this standard, these reports are sufficient to constitute substantial evidence and of course I won’t debate at the point but the nature of this statute, the kind of determination that the secretary makes means that it's to the secretary to decide these questions to evaluate the evidence to draw inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.218" offset="6136247">These reports, it seems to us are the kind of thing that whether you characterize in this hearsay or non hearsay are of the highest probative value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.170" offset="6196015">The reports are made by highly skilled professionals in the performance of their usual duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.731" offset="6218271">This is what a doctor usually does, he examines patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.799" offset="6234572">This is the form in which normally a doctor reports the results of his examination and the results of his diagnosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.060" offset="6263620">He files a written report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.499" offset="6273337">The reports reflect the standardized type of examination and medical tests that doctors traditionally employ in dealing with this kind of a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.406" offset="7316982">This was a man who had some pulmonary difficulties and the question was whether he in fact had tuberculosis and when he came to the hearing, he was very short of breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.114" offset="7371839">And this was noticed by the medical examiner and by the hearing examiner and they asked them about this and they asked him whether he walked up to the second floor or taken the elevator and how he had gotten there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.336" offset="7416665">And during the medical adviser’s testimony, the medical adviser suggested to the examiner that in view of this shortness of breathe which apparently had not been reflected in the previous reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.584" offset="7469746">That he suggested appropriateness of performing some additional tests which the examiner indicated he would have the man undergo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.109" offset="7499839">Now this it seems to me is the kind of thing that can be brought out at the hearing which may serve to overcome the doctor’s reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.683" offset="7542053">But as I -- and I say in roughly 1/3 of the cases this happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.658" offset="7558040">But our basic position is that if the triar of the fact is not convinced by this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.606" offset="7585834">If the triar of the fact just concludes on balance, the record is enough to warn a conclusion of non-disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.918" offset="7615091">He can make that determination even though the basis upon which he makes that determination, are these reports made by the doctors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.000" offset="9027375">The primary issue to be decided here is this limited one, where each side has directly contrary evidence on the crucial issue to be decided in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.149" offset="9071992">Disability of the claimant and it's directly in conflict what procedure should be involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.353" offset="9092786">The one that the Fifth Circuit has mandated where the Government must bring in their doctors, their evidence or the one that has been followed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.048" offset="9127581">Now Mr. Justice Brennan indicated this is not an adversary procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.711" offset="9146180">This is the position that has been taken by the Government but of it's very nature this is an adversary procedure because the Government on one hand has reports that say this man is not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.861" offset="9186826">The man says those reports are wrong, I am disabled and my doctor says I am disabled, so we really can't characterize this as not an adversary proceeding of its very nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.333" offset="9228727">It must be, because it is a disability hearing where there are two doctors, who are directly in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.876" offset="9258924">And the problem in social security hearings is there must be total and complete disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.336" offset="9276688">Not as in some programs as in veterans programs where there might be partial disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.485" offset="9297272">Now, we start out with a basic proposition that has been enunciated by this Court in numerous decisions that say they’re all cited by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.073" offset="9339695">One of them is Consolidated Edison versus to National Labor Relations Board that says uncorroborated hearsay does not constitute substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.071" offset="9375640">And then this Court has in many cases brought forward the proposition that the right of confrontation and cross examination even in administrative hearings is a basic right that a person has.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.549" offset="9533524">And the third point that we will make and have made in our brief is that the whole procedure that is presently followed by social security violates due process and that the hearing examiner is both the Government’s attorney and then he becomes the judge and he is not an impartial fact finder as has been required by the Court in past situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4841.989" offset="19471339">Oh I think another five minutes would certainly be plenty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.524" offset="19481475">I would like at the outset just make three little factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.823" offset="19498715">First, in the previous discussion over the role of the examiner in this case I want to make it clear these examiners are appointed under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.165" offset="19536018">They are the typical APA examiners who presided normal agency hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.135" offset="19555871">They are not under the control of the sector of health, education and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.859" offset="19574784">They are independent examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.825" offset="19582621">Now another point was made and I've been advised by the social security people that if a witness is subpoenaed at the request of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.444" offset="19625148">The Government will pay with a reasonable fee for his appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.177" offset="19644061">I'm also told that if a request is made to examine the file prior to the hearing and if the hearing examiner's office is 200 to 250 miles away, arrangements can be made to temporarily send a file to a local place where the man is, so that the claimant or his attorney can examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.896" offset="19734967">Now finally, I think it is important and on the two aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.957" offset="19759208">First, on the medical examiner's testimony, it seems to me that basically what the medical examiner is doing in this case is pretty much the same thing --</text>

            <text syncTime="4930.426" offset="19825037">The medical adviser is doing this case with any expert witness is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.106" offset="19839770">The only difference is in the case of the traditional expert witness in Court he gives his opinion in response to a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.415" offset="19872998">A whole string of hypothesis have put together and I take it if in his case the examiner had attempted to summarize the medical reports that have bee presented and then to summarize what had been testified to at the hearing, there will no objection to the adviser giving his expert judgment on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.787" offset="19946559">Now certainly, in this kind of an informal procedure that we have in these hearings, I don’t think, there's any need to resort to such formalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.293" offset="19984593">The examiner made it very clear in his questions put to the medical examiner that he was asking the medical examiner to give his opinion on the basis of the material included in the reports on the basis of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.535" offset="20053556">And to whatever extent there might be any infirmities in the reports, to whatever extent there might be reasons that the report should not be accepted, that was clear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.816" offset="20114683">This is not a case of a jury having to have medical expert opinion solicited on the basis of hypothetical questions because otherwise they might assume facts that had been proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.147" offset="20159927">This is an informal administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.665" offset="20174033">Now, the charge has been made here that the examiner is unfair, that this whole proceeding is unfair and it references to the statement of the need for cross examination and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="5064.991" offset="20363368">And then under that statute, the secretary has adopted regulations which give the examiner broad authority to conduct the hearings as he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.092" offset="20407777">And he says that it's within the discretion of the examiner to determine the procedure or hearings generally provided that such nature is for the parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.756" offset="20454379">We think that has been given and we think the fairness of this is demonstrated by the fact that in at least a third of these cases, the claimant prevails after the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.332" offset="20496697">And I suppose, in many instances it maybe that when the examiner sees the claimant before him, he gets a different view that the examiner's judgment as to what the report show and what their significance is.</text>
