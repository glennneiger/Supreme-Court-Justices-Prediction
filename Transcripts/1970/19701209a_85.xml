            <text syncTime="21.882" offset="87458">This appeal has been brought to some extent as a selective conscientious objector claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.242" offset="140957">I feel that in fairness to the petitioner that the court keep in mind exactly what this young man has become and was at the time that he faced his Draft Board on the examination for the qualifications for conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.257" offset="233012">This young man had graduated from high school and went to Texas to become a cowboy right after his graduation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.795" offset="279092">And after returning from Texas, he attended a school, the Neighborhood Playhouse School in New York City for two years and he was granted a deferment, 2S deferment as as student for those two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.868" offset="363416">Thereafter, he was classified 1A.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.676" offset="390687">In the Spring of 1967, he felt called upon to write his Draft Board and when he was classified in the early Spring in March 1964, in his classification questionnaire, he had not made any claim for being a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.230" offset="492878">But by April 1967, this was, of course, after the heating up of the war in Vietnam, he wrote his Draft Board and I think I ought to read the letter he wrote to his Draft Board, part of it at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.325" offset="649300">One, I believe that the United States government is using all the brutal instruments of modern war against a poor peasant population, which simply claims the right to have a government of its own free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.051" offset="704157">Two, I object to any assignment in the United States Armed Forces while this unnecessary and unjust war is being waged on the grounds of religious belief, specifically humanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.706" offset="762776">This essentially means respect and love for man, faith in his inherent goodness and perfectibility and confidence in his capability to improve some of the pains of the human condition."</text>
            <text syncTime="207.441" offset="829753">Thereafter, he was sent the Form 150 and he filled it out and when it came to the question of whether he was religious, he wrote in his form, "Religion to me means a devotion of man to the highest ideal that he can conceive and a respect for the dignity and voice of every human being and a capacity to enter into decent and just and loving relations with other human beings, is not depended upon being a member of a specific religious sect or organization."</text>
            <text syncTime="241.706" offset="966740">Now, as I understand from the brief of the Solicitor General, there is no issue being made as to whether this young man is religious under the Seeger and the Welsh cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.599" offset="1030374">I think that is not in dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.041" offset="1084082">It was the Judge Wyatt (ph) who was a trial Judge in the Seventh District Court in New York, he set aside from the question of sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.054" offset="1136118">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also did not question the sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.636" offset="1166524">There was no specific statement from either court, we believe this young man, to be sincere; it was simply not an issue in the mind of the court, as it did not seem to be an issue in the minds of the Draft Board, because the Draft Board simply said that this registrant seems to derive his objection to the war, mainly from the Vietnam War.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.550" offset="1290136">I'd like to read what the Draft Board said and that is on Page 11, Page 11 of the Appendix, the Joint Appendix here, at the bottom of the page.</text>

            <label>Mr. Conrad J. Lynn</label>
            <text syncTime="426.764" offset="1707050">That means that he does not want to foreclose a future contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.552" offset="1738188">I think it was an attempt to be as honest as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.888" offset="1755533">I recall very well, Your Honor, when we used to be addressed by Norman Thomas, a socialist candidate for President, who was an absolute pacifist during the wars and he was against all wars as he made very plain and he was very active in the movement against all wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.593" offset="1822302">But when the Second World War came and we were attacked at Pearl Harbor then Norman Thomas gave what he called constructive support to the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.919" offset="1863576">In other words, although, -- I believe and I don't think anyone ever questioned his sincerity between the two World Wars that he was absolutely opposed to all war.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.692" offset="1910700">He was absolute pacifist and even when he was questioned on the advent of Hitler to power, he said that he felt that he should be resisted with passive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.394" offset="1949571">But nevertheless, when the United States of America was attacked at Pearl Harbor, there was something else in him.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.065" offset="1980186">He was an American citizen and he said then, I will have to change my mind and he gave constructive support to the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.035" offset="2016131">He was honest each time but there were different occasions which greatly moved him.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.458" offset="2041731">So this young man just as the young man in the Sisson case as Judge Wyzanski pointed out, he was being honest as he could be at this time when he is being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.667" offset="2098573">He is sure of what he is saying and what he believes at this point and therefore, he said, I might defend the country if it were attacked because he could not be satan of of what happened to him in that contingency and I submit that, that does not derogate from the sincerity of his conviction, of being opposed to the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.668" offset="2194599">Now, I say further that when he was questioned as comes out in the further questioning that he would defend his family or defend himself from attacking, he would defend it by every means necessary, defend from attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.134" offset="2268473">These are exceptions that have been recognized because it is true that absolute pacifist does not resisted all, an absolute pacifist does not resisted all.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.404" offset="2325525">Contrary to the statement on Page 16 of the government's answering brief which says that the Congress has recognized conscientious objection as a basis for exemption, at the top of the Page 16, for military service has -- it extend as a privilege to persons other than those who are total pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.728" offset="2430851">Pardon me, I need to go back on Page 15 at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.914" offset="2451644">"Never in all the years in which Congress has recognized conscientious objection as a basis for exemption from military service, has it extended the privilege to persons other than those who were total pacifists, that is opposed to all forms of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.773" offset="2515069">Now that is not altogether accurate, of course, because that exception of the proviso that I would defend myself, I would defend my friends, I would defend those close to me has not been considered to prevent a person from being considered a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.731" offset="2610887">And of course, as the court is well aware in the whole line of cases, involving Jehovah's Witnesses culminating in the Sicurella case, this exception on the part of Jehovah's Witnesses who have written tracks, they published a track in 1951 in their publication "Watch God," I think -- Watchtower.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.447" offset="2713704">They published an article saying why we are not pacifists and the Court in Sicurella handled that by coming to the conclusion that the Jehovah's Witnesses were not really concerned with the war, when they said, we are ready for war that is God ordained, that our Jehovah says that we should participate in.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.219" offset="2836793">We are ready for that war, when they said that, they don't mean a real war on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.645" offset="2854557">However, they were other authorities, Baington (ph) for example, who said that the Jehovah's Witnesses might very well have considered that the First World War was a one where the anti-Christ was involved, the German Kaiser and therefore, they might very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.544" offset="2922162">I don't personally know what the position of the Jehovah's Witnesses was in the First World War, but it isn't as if the Jehovah's Witnesses would not fight in any war.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.815" offset="2963226">If they felt that a war were a God ordained, a war right on as many as all of the justices know, many of the most bitter wars have been religious wars, so that when you exempt people who are in favor of a war that so conforms with their religion, then you are making a very major exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.007" offset="3063954">And so therefore, we have here the germ of the approach to save the statute because as I see it, the Court has the choice in this argument of saving the statute by interpreting it as it was interpreted for one way in the Tass (ph) case where the court, a Court of Appeals, the Eight Circuit felt that when the statute said, participation in war in any form, it was -- in any form, it was talking about a modification of participation in any form or participation, that was perhaps a semantic way of dealing with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.818" offset="3243259">But they did have this question, this logical question that there are exceptions to a person not being willing to engage in violent conduct and yet he is qualified as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.066" offset="3312222">The court has had this problem, of course, before with this same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.190" offset="3336673">The law does read very clearly that a person, by reason of religious training and belief qualifies as a conscientious objector and originally the statute said also that the touchstone was whether the person believe in a supreme being.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.463" offset="3405845">Now, of course, in the Seeger case, the Court interpreted that statute in accordance, I submit, with the contemporary understanding of religion in large sections of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.147" offset="3472509">We know many sincere and religiously motivated persons, no longer believe in the anthropomorphic God and yet they are stirred by the religious impulses.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.237" offset="3536875">And therefore, in Seeger, this Court recognized that and then in the Welsh case, which was even further ahead and the Welsh case went so far to say and that this germane here that even if a person, as a part of his moral stats, had taken into account political problems as Welsh had very much so and economic problems and the social destiny of the country, even though this was apart, and the statute said that merely philosophical, social, political beliefs cannot be a part of this religious feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.337" offset="3705313">Nevertheless, the court pointed out and I think very logically and in accordance with reality that very often the political and economic and social feelings of a person contributes to his total moral position, that core of conscious which is supreme for the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.251" offset="4776960">That was in the very beginning of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.341" offset="4785319">It was before the war had actually heated up after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.181" offset="4808620">Now he developed his position, he has watched the war as he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.254" offset="4841012">I mean, this had an effect on his thinking, and he became convinced as a result of what he was witnessing as he said, as the Board said, he had watched it on the news media, on TV, and over the radio, he have read the newspapers, this had a profound effect on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.942" offset="4927739">He didn't claim that he had read all the philosophers' life as Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.752" offset="4946965">Sisson made, he had gotten his Masters in Philosophy, and no doubt, he had a more systematic background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.054" offset="4980193">But this young man became convinced as he lived through the events very curiously everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.873" offset="5015406">And that's how he formed his conviction, and as he said, as he testified, before the Draft Board when he was questioned, he had gotten through the Vietnam War, a feeling against war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.390" offset="5069531">Now that is a position, I think, that the Court should be aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.183" offset="5092728">Now it maybe that on ballots the Draft Board's finding should be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.940" offset="5115716">Now if it is accepted, then and if the statute cannot bear the interpretation that a person religiously motivated in the sense of the Seeger case, can be a conscientious objector if the main thrust of his feeling is against the war in which he is faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.139" offset="5204532">As he said, I am against the war, because this is the war that I am faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.341" offset="5225326">If it cannot be of that interpretation, then, of course, I don't see how the statute can stand under the First Amendment because there is no question, but that they have this position, this particular religious view that he has is sincerely held, and to deny him the right to be a conscientious objector when others are granted it who have a more general position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.362" offset="5349355">Although in my opinion, a person who is so careful as he was to make claim that he didn't foreclose the possibility, that he might defend his country, if it were actually attacked, I would say that this is profound and is a position of that meriting as great due respect as any possible position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.307" offset="5981205">Of course not, but because this war has affected his belief to such a degree that he cannot take any part whatsoever in its support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.742" offset="6034913">Therefore he could not conscientiously say even over here because he would be replacing a man who might very well participate in that portion of it, which greatly revokes his feelings and I think that this is not only, he has this right not just because of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.160" offset="6124565">I think he has this right under the First Amendment because where you have conceded that this is a religiously motivated impulse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.838" offset="6167301">Then you recognize the supremacy of conscience and the one parallel case that comes to my mind is the dissenting opinion of Judge, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in US against Macintosh, speaking for himself and Stone and Holmes and Brandeis, and that position I think was later adopted by Judge Douglas in writing the majority opinion in Girouard, and where this person had said that he could not take an oath to participate in all wars that his conscience would have to determine whether he could take, and of course, he was denied the right to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.731" offset="6346919">But in the Girouard case, of course the Court held that the domain of conscience is supreme reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.209" offset="6404807">A brief from the opinion in the -- reading briefly from the opinion which was adopted in Girouard case, reading from the Judge Hughes opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.236" offset="6480875">"Undoubtedly in the forum of conscience, duty to a moral power higher than the State has always been maintained."</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.187" offset="6516715">So I think that the Unites States constitution recognizes in the First Amendment, this right of conscience and as was said by Stone in his great essay which was quoted in the Seeger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.108" offset="6576379">A state should, a state that we can support, should recognize this supremacy of the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.584" offset="6614309">All of our history, he says, which is quoted in Seeger at Page 170.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.738" offset="6634893">"All our history gives confirmation to the view that liberty of conscience has a moral and social value which makes it worthy of preservation at the hands of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.989" offset="6667912">So deep in its significance and vital, indeed, is it to the integrity of man's moral and spiritual nature that nothing short of the self-preservation of the state should warrant its violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.637" offset="6710544">And it may well be questioned whether the state which preserves its life by a settled policy of violation of the conscience of the individual will not in fact ultimately lose it by the process."</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.134" offset="9664470">Congress is expressly given power by the constitution to raise and support armies but how is it possible to do this as a practical matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.773" offset="10007092">And finally, there are a number of decisions which construe the statutory language the way it reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.557" offset="10038126">Perhaps, the best known of these is that by the great Judge Augustus Hand in his opinion in United States against Kauten, cited on page 18 of our brief, where he said that a belief is sufficient to qualify for a Conscientious Objector status must be a general scruple is "against participation in war in any form," and not merely an objection to participation in the particular war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.651" offset="10182531">Now, this interpretation has been followed in a number of cases, also cited on page 18 of our brief, including the two cases, the two courts below in the cases now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.509" offset="10245956">There is also the well known passage by Mr. Justice Cardozo concurred in by Justices Stone and Brandeis in Hamilton against Regents, and the court's opinion in that case quoting with the approval from United States against Macintosh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.107" offset="10320353">And this seems to have been the unanimous view of the Court in the Welsh case, as we have indicated by references to the three opinions in that case on page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.707" offset="10382733">And since the proper construction of the statued, shows that Congress has determined to limit the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.271" offset="10417006">The remaining question before the Court is, whether this legislative judgment runs afoul of some constitutional command.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.894" offset="10455562">Now, we submit that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.995" offset="10479909">Turning to the constitutional argument, we note first, that the constitution in simple but broad and unqualified terms gives the Congress power to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.824" offset="10539259">This has been then broadly construed by this Court, in the selective Draft Law Cases and more recently in United States against O'Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.747" offset="10586906">The chief ground for limitation suggested here, is that of religious freedom under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.598" offset="10622328">This Court has declared that Congress need grant no exemption to conscientious objectives at all in Hamilton against Regents, and United States against Macintosh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.493" offset="10673946">I am glad that Congress does provide an exemption for conscientious objectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.843" offset="10695367">Indeed my principal concern about this case, is that if the exemption is pushed to unintended and impractical lengths it may jeopardize the whole concept of the exemption, which has in fact worked rather remarkably well over a period of close to 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.313" offset="10781153">When there was, as there was for a long time, an essentially religious meaning to the phrase religious training and belief, then there was an external standard which could be used with some objectivity in determining the sincerity of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.693" offset="10862759">Now, that is largely gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.994" offset="10875925">If Selective Conscientious Objection has to be recognized, the external standards almost completely disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.678" offset="10914691">It then becomes almost entirely a matter of personal preference or choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.379" offset="10941440">Many personal choices are passionately held, sincerely and conscientiously maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.146" offset="10972578">Indeed, one of the comments often made about youth is that they readily convert any matter of choice or preference into a matter of sincerity or conscientious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.954" offset="11023778">One of the problems about a conscientious objector system is to administer it fairly, fairly to those who go as well as to those who are allowed to engage in alternative service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.813" offset="11083233">It needs to be remembered that for every Conscientious Objector, for every Conscientious Objector there is a man called to serve who would not otherwise be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.568" offset="11134224">He isn't here, he isn't before us but in every case, it is a choice between this man and some other man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.876" offset="11167451">If it becomes impossible to administer the system fairly, then Congress may conclude that it should be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.477" offset="11201829">Many would agree I think that, that would be unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.803" offset="11223144">In the terms of the First Amendment, there are two aspects, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.835" offset="11263269">Both the history and the practice with respect to Conscientious Objector Provisions show that Congress was seeking to accommodate rather than to establish religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.246" offset="11316976">This is indeed the effect of the Welsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.732" offset="11330873">To make it clear that no form of religion or non-religion, as long as it is deeply held, is given special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.699" offset="11374759">No religion is favored, none is discriminated against, and none as established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.672" offset="11410599">In excluding selective objectors, there is no religious preference, no religious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.851" offset="11451350">No one is called because he holds a particular religion, no one is exempted because he holds a particular religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.316" offset="11493251">What the statute does, is to recognize a qualitative difference between general and selective objection without regard to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.911" offset="11547585">If the claim is deeply and sincerely held, Selective Conscientious Objection necessarily involves a form of political judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.671" offset="11602651">A conclusion in opposition to the policy reached by the duly elected government, with respect to a particular area at a certain time, under stated conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.819" offset="11667226">Though the response may be religiously or conscientiously motivated, it rests in the first instance on a decision that is particular and political.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.782" offset="11719053">In contrast, those who conscientiously oppose participation in combat in any form do not invoke the same type of contemporary political judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.183" offset="11776731">There objection is to war, all the war, independent of place, time or circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.917" offset="11819572">We have here a particular form of selective objection, but there could be others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.623" offset="11854472">Objections to particular weapons or to the political make up of our allies in any war or to combat on Sunday or on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.468" offset="11917793">Congress does not establish or disestablish any religion when it says that such matters need not be gone into, that Selective Conscientious Objections of any sort will not be recognized, whether based on religious, humanistic or purely personal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.051" offset="12012147">While the claims of the categorical objector will be accepted, if based on religious, humanistic or deeply held conscientious grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.719" offset="12066795">In this determination, religion and the conventional sense or the absence of it, is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.460" offset="12097829">There is no establishment of religion here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.224" offset="12296882">That has to do I think with construing the intention of Congress with respect to these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.852" offset="12327393">Finally, there is no violation of the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.973" offset="12351843">Many persons conscientiously oppose many facets of the law established by the Congress and the State Legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.824" offset="12391236">A mention maybe made of abortion, the death penalty, marijuana, polygamy, divorce, vaccination, fluoridation and birth control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.984" offset="12455915">These objections may be most sincerely held and based upon deep religious teaching and conviction or equally held Conscientious Scruples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.098" offset="12508369">Yet it is long since established, that the mere fact that the objection is religious or deeply held, does not give the holder of such views any license to violate the duly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.613" offset="12574407">Religiously derived views do not prevail over a national policy and justify non-compliance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.915" offset="12615576">A contrary view would extent to the payment of taxes to compliance with laws for the education of children to Health Laws and many other aspects of our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.318" offset="12673254">Indeed, it is not too much to say that to proceed very far down that road, leads to a form of anarchy where each person makes up his own mind which of the law is established by the democratic process, he feels he can conscientiously comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.668" offset="12746606">This is essentially inconsistent with democratic government and would undermine the integrity of the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.598" offset="12786312">In allowing exemptions to those opposed to war in any form, Congress has successfully charted a course that preserve the autonomy and freedom of religious bodies while avoiding any semblance of established religion as this Court said, last term in the Welsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.251" offset="12872934">And finally, there is no violation here of the Equal Protection concepts which may be implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.812" offset="12911177">Though that amendment does not itself contain an Equal protection clause in haec verba.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.020" offset="12936046">As I have suggested there is a qualitative difference between those who assert and unhonorables "religious" opposition to killing in any war and those who scruples against a particular war necessarily depend upon or social or political considerations of the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.136" offset="13028519">The classification which Congress has adopted is a rational one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.529" offset="13050044">Congress could of course extend it, but this was not recommended by the most recent comprehensive survey of the Draft Laws, the Burke Marshall Commission's report as cited on page 34 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.490" offset="13121933">Congress has in fact maintained a choice which has been a part of the fabric of our law and national practice for nearly 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.839" offset="13163311">There is no reason for concluding now, that this choice violates any provision or concept of our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.946" offset="13203749">We submit that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.178" offset="13240633">I just want to call to the Court's attention that the Draft Board in this case was -- disqualified him because he said, Mr. Gillette, that it was the Vietnam War, that forced him to have was the motivating force from having a Conscientious Objector position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.488" offset="13329868">To conclude from that, that it was only this war he is objected to, I think is an extension of what was really said and it was a conclusion on the part of a Draft Board which I think was unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.854" offset="13383367">And secondly, I might point out that in Seeger and not weaving of Welsh altogether but in Seeger, it was acknowledged that political considerations might very well form a part of the base of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.646" offset="13446583">How can one in our time and especially young man, was so must think deeply about these problems completely put aside any political consideration in coming to a moral stage in their conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.670" offset="13510635">And I think it would be -- it's artificial to say that there must be no political consideration at all before a Conscientious Objection is recognized.</text>
