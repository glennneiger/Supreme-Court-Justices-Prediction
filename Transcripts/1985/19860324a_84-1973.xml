            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144946">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Three Affiliated Tribes against Wold Engineering Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.118" offset="185384">Mr. Cross, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="12.950" offset="196668">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.483" offset="210775">This matter is before this Court for the second time on a Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.695" offset="239718">This case squarely presents the issue left undecided by this Court in its previous decision in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.750" offset="267930">That issue is whether a state may enact a statute barring tribal Indians but not non-Indians, from state court for hearing damage actions against non-Indian defendants in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.830" offset="324250">Respondent, Wold Engineering, urges this Court to uphold the state statute that bars all tribal Indians residing on the four Reservations in North Dakota from access to state court for the enforcement of their damages actions against non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.244" offset="401886">This Court previously held in this matter that such a state statute is not required nor authorized by federal law, particularly Public Law 280, as a measure to protect the tribal Indians in the area of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.055" offset="473148">The facts of this case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.307" offset="490076">This case involves a breach of contract and negligence action for damages brought by the Three Affiliated Tribes against Wold Engineering, a non-Indian firm in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.896" offset="532499">This action arose on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.497" offset="546918">In 1974, the Three Affiliated Tribes contracted with Wold Engineering to design and build a water supply system known as the Four Bears Water Supply System on the Fort Berthold Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.683" offset="595610">However, in 1977, after the project was completed, the Tribes discovered that the project failed to supply a safe and continuous water supply to the portion of the Reservation people it was intended to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.904" offset="656528">Despite efforts at correction by Wold Engineering, the project never functioned properly and in 1980 the Three Affiliated Tribes commenced this action in the State District Court for the Northwest Judicial District of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.505" offset="718908">The trial court, upon Wold's motion, dismissed the Tribes' complaint, holding that actions arising on the Indian reservations in North Dakota brought by tribal members cannot be enforced against non-Indian defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.415" offset="778572">In 1982, the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that actions arising on the reservations and brought by tribal Indians against non-Indians cannot be heard in state court because of a state disclaimer known as the Indian Civil Jurisdiction Act of 1963, as well as the influence of Public Law 280 ousted the state court from subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.623" offset="887346">This Court granted the Tribe the first petition for Certiorari and after hearing reversed... pardon me, vacated the judgment of the North Dakota Supreme Court, holding that Public Law 280 neither authorized nor required such a jurisdictional bar to tribal Indians' access to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.675" offset="971565">Further, the Supreme Court, this Court, remanded the case for further proceedings in light of the Supreme Court's holding that this matter should be scrutinized by the court below for possible constitutional infirmities and further that Chapter 27-19 was not authorized by Public Law 280 or any other federal law as a jurisdictional disclaimer of subject matter jurisdiction in this category of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.815" offset="1092146">The court below on remand held that the matter of state law alone, that Indians, tribal Indians, residing on the reservation were barred from maintaining these actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.744" offset="1143868">The reason for this barrier arises from the state jurisdictional statute, known as the Indian Civil Jurisdiction Statute of 1963, and that this state law alone barred the tribal Indians access to state court in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.290" offset="1298095">The only exception to this extension would be that the state court's power to levy and execute on tribal property may be exempted by state or federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.445" offset="1930677">In other words, the presumption had been, and it appeared under state law prior to the decision in Wold II, that the consent did not bar tribal Indians, including tribal governments, from suing non-Indians in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.694" offset="1987624">It was after the State Supreme Court took a second look at the jurisdictional effect of the state statute that they held that the intent was to completely bar tribal Indians, including suits against non-Indians for the enforcement of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.995" offset="5580923">On solely a state law question except in a diversity situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.107" offset="5597328">This statute, as we have said before, excludes all tribal Indians on the four reservations in North Dakota from access to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.285" offset="5646020">Now, the state court previously, in a decision entitled Vermillion v. Spotted Elk, had held that Indian tribes or at least Indian individuals were entitled to enforce their rights in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.305" offset="5706102">However, in 1963, the state enacted the Indian Civil Jurisdiction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.560" offset="5731179">That statute has been construed by the state court below of barring tribal Indians from access until they consent to the extension of the state civil jurisdiction over their person and property on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.218" offset="5785723">Now, this consent goes far beyond the issue at hand in the particular case of whether Wold Engineering may or may not maintain a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.325" offset="5826161">It would subject the tribe and the consenting individuals under Section 27-19-05 of the state statute to general state judicial jurisdiction for all cases as a condition for maintaining this one damages action against a non-Indian in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.644" offset="5891467">It would also confer on the state the authority to legislate in a variety of subject-matter areas in contract, in divorce, in guardianships, in other areas not limited to those subject-matter categories that are now presently reserved to tribal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.409" offset="5970566">So that the design and purpose of the statute, as construed by the court below, is to completely bar tribal Indians from maintaining these actions unless they consent to the extension of state civil jurisdiction for virtually all purposes, the only exception being that the state may not use their enforcement powers to levy or execute on tribal Indian property unless it is authorized by federal or state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.776" offset="6079966">We believe... The tribes believe and have argued in their brief that such restrictions on the civil rights of tribal Indians, the restriction on due process rights of tribal Indians, requires a special justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.759" offset="6155930">It requires special justification because the matter peeves two issues of Indian ancestry and Indian identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.876" offset="6204414">There is no other bases for the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.410" offset="6226566">This Court, in its prior decision in this matter, said that the state statute was not required by federal law to protect the rights of tribal Indians in the sense of the pre-emption doctrine; that this statute did not require a governing federal law under Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.540" offset="6295006">Consequently, the state statute bars a... bears a heavy burden of justification to allow it to stand to restrict all tribal Indians from maintaining the action in state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.098" offset="6381315">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.628" offset="6395421">The North Dakota legislative plan, Chapter 27-19 of the North Dakota Century Code, a 1963 jurisdictional act, which Mr. Cross refers to, and the North Dakota Supreme Court's decision in this case, and Wold Engineering, all seek precisely the same thing and that is equal justice for everyone under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.111" offset="6473370">The current situation in North Dakota guarantees to everyone that equal access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.867" offset="6504404">Three Tribes and Mr. Cross argues here today that somehow Indian litigants or tribal litigants is being denied access to a court in situations where others have that access and that is simply not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.186" offset="6561664">In the case of an Indian... In all cases, where the facts are the same, the access of the litigants is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.922" offset="6592593">If you have a situation of an Indian Litigant against a non-Indian litigant or a non-Indian litigant against an Indian litigant for an off-reservation occurrence, all litigants in the State of North Dakota have equal access to the state courts of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.123" offset="6653406">They all have the same rights, remedies and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.974" offset="6664796">In the situation of an Indian litigant against a non-Indian litigant or a non-Indian litigant against an Indian litigant, the facts that we have in this case, the state court of North Dakota would impose the same jurisdictional restraints and requirements on all litigants and would deny access in those cases to all litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.399" offset="6750477">Again, the same rights, procedures and privileges would be available to all under North Dakota law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.484" offset="6770853">So, as it now stands, the North Dakota jurisdictional plan guarantees for everyone equal justice under the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.602" offset="8479261">At the present time, I don't believe that there is a mechanism for collecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.895" offset="8492427">The North Dakota Supreme Court in its decision stated that if the Indian people were to somehow consent to state court jurisdiction, that to the extent that it is allowed under federal or state policy, the North Dakota court would have to... the North Dakota decision could be enforced on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.557" offset="8575078">That mechanism has not yet been fully explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.121" offset="8585423">At the current time, I don't believe that there is a mechanism for enforcing a judgment received against the Indian tribe outside of perhaps their own courts recognizing under some principle of comity the decision of the North Dakota court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.281" offset="8649997">And, I am saying that the concomitant relationship would have to exist between the state courts and the people on the Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.097" offset="8685315">If the state court of North Dakota is going to refuse to entertain jurisdiction on the reservation, and principles of comity would require it to recognize those decisions which come from the reservation and give them force and effect off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.719" offset="8759816">The jurisdictional void has to be filled somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.542" offset="8775072">Mr. Cross is here today arguing that the North Dakota decision denied equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.117" offset="8805374">Even if the Court is to somehow believe that a classification is here being made, I would submit that the North Dakota jurisdictional plan could still survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.623" offset="8847379">The goal of equal protection is to end a caste-based society where classification based upon race or other immutable characteristics are perpetrated and continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.950" offset="8896698">It also involves, I believe, a bit of overreaching, a substantial amount of overreaching, by the group with the political power to control and to keep in a subservient position that group without political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.240" offset="8953854">When those facts jell and the pot is churned, then you have a situation where overreaching occurs and equal protection is denied to certain people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.558" offset="8995127">The North Dakota law does not create a caste-based society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.251" offset="9009860">As it currently stands, everyone is treated the same, everyone similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.564" offset="9031176">Three Tribes' position in this case will, however, create a caste-based society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.757" offset="9051970">It will have a situation where Indian litigants will be allowed to use the state forum in North Dakota without ever having to appear as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.162" offset="9093557">They will also have all rules of procedure available to them, while the non-Indian litigant will have none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.076" offset="9117171">This is a caste-based society and this would be greatly unfair and would violate the due process of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.112" offset="9145384">Secondly, the North Dakota jurisdictional plan draws no distinction based upon race or other immutable characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.239" offset="9181850">The disability of the Indian litigant in this case comes from his tribal status and being located on the reservation and those are political concerns and political considerations, not necessarily racial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.016" offset="9232946">Furthermore, if they are racial, they are not immutable, because they can be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.179" offset="9253635">The classic equal protection case is a situation where no matter what one does to try and better himself, to try to improve himself, to try to change his position, he cannot do it, because the legislation refuses to allow him that chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.979" offset="9304835">The North Dakota law gives the Indian people a chance to remove the impediment to the state court in this case and all they have to do to receive that protection is simply agree to follow and obey the reasonable rules of court set out in North Dakota and to obey and agree to follow the reasonable rules of substantive law which have been laid out in the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.433" offset="9402637">So, there is no immutable characteristic which cannot be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.466" offset="9418729">If that is the case, it would seem to me that the proper standard for review on this case would be the rational basis standard and if you apply the rational basis test to this case, you can see that the North Dakota Supreme Court enacted its legislation pursuant to authority granted by Congress in Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.930" offset="9500649">Further, the people of the State of North Dakota, at the time they enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act in... The Indian Civil Jurisdiction Act in 1963 could have unilaterally imposed all jurisdiction on the Indian people without listening to them, without paying them any attention whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.310" offset="9570135">Instead of doing that, they held legislative hearings around the state and the Indian people came to those legislative hearings and told the State of North Dakota stay out, we want all or nothing at all jurisdiction until we ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.580" offset="9627186">And, that, I think, also destroys traditional equal protection problem here in that we do not have the overreaching by the group with political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.487" offset="9666892">In fact, we have a situation where the group that had the ultimate political power was leaning backwards to try and give the Indian people some self-determination and a voice in their own destiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.944" offset="9712659">A compact or compromise was reached, if you will, between the people of the State of North Dakota and the Indians residing on their reservations in the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.152" offset="9753514">This subject-matter jurisdictional plan, this compact and compromise existing between the Indian people and between the State of North Dakota is now over 20 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.179" offset="9797609">The Indian people in the State of North Dakota asked for this jurisdictional plan and in that period of time, since this jurisdictional plan was enacted, the North Dakota Supreme Court has had a number of occasions to rule on the issues that are before this Court today and in 1963, only about two or three months after the jurisdictional plan went into effect, the first case came down and in that first case the North Dakota Supreme Court held that the North Dakota courts would have no subject-matter jurisdiction on the Indian reservation in matters involving Indian litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.132" offset="9941387">So, for 20 years this jurisdictional setting has been known to the Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.315" offset="9962180">They knew or should have known that for 20 years that there would be this problem that would present itself some day, yet in that 20-year period of time, not once did the Indian people come to the North Dakota legislature and try to rework or renegotiate a jurisdictional plan that would be workable and agreeable to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.077" offset="10041175">Not once in that 20-year period of time did the Indian people set up an election or try to hold a tribal election to see if they would want to take this jurisdictional plan and not once in that 20-year period of time, not until this case apparently, did the Indian people act to create their own forum which would, in the future, be able to control these sorts of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.334" offset="10138246">So, now, 20 years after it has been known to them, they try to come through the backdoor of the courthouse, while at the same time denying all other litigants access to the front door of the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.574" offset="10183176">The solution to this case exists in the North Dakota law and it is a political solution that should be worked out through political compromise between the Indian people and the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.200" offset="10233645">That was the situation that Congress envisioned in Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.504" offset="10250886">It is the situation that Congress envisioned and still exists by the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.658" offset="10275545">The jurisdictional plan that should go into effect should result not in some forced, crammed-down jurisdiction by the Indian people in the State of North Dakota, but through a negotiated political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.146" offset="10325491">If people would get together and act reasonably on a situation like this, reasonable results could be obtained; a reasonable plan for either enforcing the Indian forum could be reached or a reasonable plan for bringing about the orderly assumption of state court jurisdiction on the Indian reservations could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.017" offset="10400933">There has been no denial of equal protection in this case and should the Indian plan... should Three Tribes jurisdictional plan be adopted, in fact, we will have unequal protection and it will be the unequal protection of having the class of super plaintiffs holding down the class of hapless defendants and that will be a situation which will continue indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.793" offset="10488077">Further, there has been no denial of due process, the goal of due process, as I understand it, is to preserve the fundamental rights guaranteed to people under the Constitution and that is a... one of those rights is a guarantee of access to a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.193" offset="10549622">There has been a guaranteed forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.036" offset="13285060">The yardstick of any law is not often the yardstick of the common man, but in this particular case, we are dealing with something known as a fundamental right, then the layman's perception is the yardstick to judge whether or not something is fair or fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.092" offset="13389237">I would submit that outside Three Affiliated Tribes, if you were to propose this particular jurisdictional plan where one side would have all access to the court for all purposes and all procedures available for their protection as Plaintiffs, and the Defendant would have none of the rights and remedies available and none of the procedural safeguards available to him, that there would not be a common man or layman who would say that that is fundamentally fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.651" offset="13491532">In fact, he would say that that is fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.882" offset="13500414">That is the situation that the Three Affiliated Tribes is seeking to impose in the state court of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.507" offset="13522879">To conclude, I would like to close with a small analogy of a baseball game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.589" offset="13539284">Imagine, if you will, one team at the plate where the batter has an unlimited number of swings to make contact with the ball, and, furthermore, the team at bat has an unlimited number of outs to score as many runs as they want to for as long as they want to keep scoring, and the team that is in the outfield cannot even quit the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.694" offset="13627682">Now, that is the jurisdictional plan and scheme that the Indian people are trying to impose on the people of North Dakota where the people of North Dakota will be forever the team that is out in the field shagging balls.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.022" offset="13728933">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, to point out that the tribal courts are open to non-Indian plaintiffs and many non-Indian plaintiffs for debt collection and other purpose take advantage of the tribal courts to maintain actions precisely of the kind that are at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.784" offset="13799986">However, by contrast, the state courts are not open to tribal Indians or tribal governments unless they consent to the extension or virtually complete state civil jurisdiction over the person or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.771" offset="13847947">The tribes believe that that infringes on their due process and equal protection rights and as well it would interfere with operation of fundamentally important federal policies governing the Indian affairs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.669" offset="13895594">First of all, it would interfere with the doctrine of the protection of the political independence of the tribes and the economic independence of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.275" offset="13938017">If such a state statute is allowed to stand, it means that individuals will be compelled to consent to the extension of state civil jurisdiction, not only for the purpose of the case at hand, but for extension of state legislative and judicial jurisdiction generally except as limited by terms I of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.740" offset="14015862">That would fundamentally impair how the tribes operate under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.643" offset="14039477">The result of such a state statute would be the creation of a checkerboard jurisdictional system unknown now in federal Indian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.690" offset="14083676">Individuals would be compelled... Individuals tribal members, including governments, would be compelled to commit themselves to accepting state civil jurisdiction generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.706" offset="14299761">The answer to your question is that the individual Indian cannot waive the tribal governmental sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.070" offset="14325152">At most, through the individual consent procedure 27-19-05, it can submit himself... the individual can submit himself to the full scope of state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.888" offset="14364440">What would happen in the usual case, and this has already been tried in state court, is that the individual would have to consent, the individual tribal member would have to consent, perhaps as a basis of extension of credit, on the reservation by a non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.726" offset="14427761">So, you would have a system in which, as a usual matter, the non-Indian would become subject to an unclear area of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.001" offset="14460884">On the one hand, they have submitted themselves under the state civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.564" offset="14475199">On the other hand, tribal government would assert that they have the right to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.601" offset="14519294">--The individual, Justice Marshall, is that they cannot waive tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.206" offset="14541759">The state statute appears to force the individual to come in to, if they want access to state court, to submit themselves individually to all of the state legislative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.875" offset="14596407">So, a tribal Indian as he tries for access to state court must say through a written statement, through an executed statement with the county auditor where he resides, that he is going to accept state jurisdiction; that he is going to accept state jurisdiction for virtually all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.437" offset="14666624">And, that is why we believe this state statute interferes not only with the established due process rights of the tribal members involved, but also would frustrate the operation of fundamental federal policies.</text>
