            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144366">You may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="13.324" offset="197656">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.958" offset="200164">The veterans' preference granted in New York's Constitution was upheld by this Court a dozen years ago against an identical challenge, that it impermissibly discriminated against veterans who were not residents of New York at the time they were inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.083" offset="252617">That case was called August against Bronstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="263380">The Second Circuit felt that August against Bronstein was no longer good law in light of recent doctrinal developments in this Court, specifically the Zobel against Williams case, and presumably Hooper against Fernalillo County, although that had not been decided at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="326074">We believe that these recent decisions do not overrule the August, and that New York's classification is reasonably designed to fulfill legitimate state purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.885" offset="359824">Veteran preference laws have a long history in this country, and their constitutionality is a well settled matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.289" offset="389499">New York, as well as 15 other states, conditions the award on veterans' preference credits on residence in the state at the time of induction into the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.310" offset="425548">Since the 1920's New York has promised in its Constitution that if a resident goes into the armed services, serves during time of war, and is honorably discharged, that person on passing a Civil Service examination is entitled to five additional points in competing for public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.689" offset="499109">That commitment has never been withdrawn, and the commitment can only be withdrawn, we emphasize, by amending the State Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="95.712" stopTime="102.616">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="527112">Mr. Hermann, is there any time limit imposed on the exercise of this privilege or benefit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_hermann" startTime="102.616" stopTime="212.253">
            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="102.616" offset="554802">No, I do not believe there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.866" offset="559817">It's a one time privilege but there is no time limit on its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.870" offset="583746">We believe that whether New York's constitutional provision is viewed as a right to travel matter or as an equal protection matter, the result here turns on whether at a minimum, New York's classification rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose, and the Court of Appeals, we know, is divided on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.647" offset="654903">We believe the essential error in the Second Circuit's opinion was that it failed to perceive that New York's law rationally does further legitimate state purposes because the Second Circuit viewed the law simply as a retrospective measure, a reward for past services.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.741" offset="719269">It largely ignored the law's prospective function as an incentive measure, one designed to encourage service in the military, to encourage persons to return to the State of New York, and to engage in public service thereafter, and these are separate purposes which I'll discuss in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.065" offset="764617">But, unlike the New Mexico and Alaska statutes struck down in recent cases of this Court, New York's Constitution is and has been for a long time forward-looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.641" offset="814877">Forty years ago, in an informal... in a formal opinion the State's Attorney General described the law as largely self-executing, and by that he meant that as part of the State's Constitution it guaranteed these benefits, and the only function of the legislature was to prescribe the periods of award.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.770" offset="887393">And the Attorney General's opinion 40 years ago specifically said that a veteran of a war who would have a cause of action in New York State courts for this right even if the Legislature failed to determine time of award.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.196" offset="949146">Thus, this is not an after the fact attempt by the State simply to take care of its own, and we believe that the fact that the Court of Appeals overlooked this is the critical flaw in its whole--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="212.253" stopTime="227.430">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="212.253" offset="993346">Isn't the origin of that concept of taking care of their own, as you put it, something that goes back to at least the Civil War when the states raised the troops and sent them in, and of course that was true earlier?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_hermann" startTime="227.430" stopTime="280.398">
            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="227.430" offset="1054054">--That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.632" offset="1062831">We discussed some of that history, both the constitutional history and the legislative history, in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.536" offset="1086446">New York' statute goes back at least until the Civil War, and I think it's worth observing that the Second Circuit has no discussion whatsoever in its opinion of the nature of that history, or of the important fact we rely on here which is that it's a constitutional commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.330" offset="1165649">The Second Circuit found that New York has no legitimate interest in encouraging its residents to serve in the military, but the Court offered no support or citation for that conclusion in referring simply to patriotism, as it described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.190" offset="1225104">We submit that New York has acted from patriotic motives, and that the Second Circuit was wrong in declaring illegitimate New York's interest in encouraging its residents to serve.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="289.587" offset="1302635">As to people who are drafted, it certainly doesn't serve to encourage service in the military, but it does serve two subsequent functions of encouraging them to return to the state and encouraging them to engage in public service thereafter.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="303.847" offset="1359687">--General Hermann, do you think that's really what the legislature had in mind when the people adopted this part of the Constitution, all of these rather fine-spun rationales for why the thing might pass a court test?</text>
            <text syncTime="319.607" offset="1422694">Isn't the usual motivation for... it's just kind of gratitude for people who have served in the service and wanting to give them a little bit of a break after they get out?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_hermann" startTime="328.462" stopTime="350.142">
            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="328.462" offset="1458116">Certainly that's one of the major reasons why these statutes and these constitutional provisions have been enacted, but the standard justification given in most of the case law, Your Honor, for these statutes is fourfold, and two of those purposes... at least one of the major purposes always described is to encourage service in the military, and we do rely on that as a motivation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="350.142" stopTime="360.184">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="350.142" offset="1544843">You say it's given in the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.561" offset="1554560">You think, then, the courts are probably the best finders of legislative motivation in a case like this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_hermann" startTime="360.184" stopTime="783.241">
            <label>Mr. Robert Hermann</label>
            <text syncTime="360.184" offset="1585071">I think the applicable standard here, again we submit, is the rational basis standard so that any basis which can be put forward to rationally justify the statute should be sufficient to sustain its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.757" offset="1635331">In the initial... in the August against Bronstein decision, the Court found that these were the four purposes which were served, and relying on the opinion of Chief Judge Friendly in a case called Russell against Hodges we believe that the states do have a role as states in encouraging service of their residents in the military, and that the Constitution does give the states the role as such in providing for national defense, and we looked at two things specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.629" offset="1762808">Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the authority to raise militias according to the discipline prescribed by Congress is reserved to the states, and Clause 15 explicitly reserves to the states, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="416.770" offset="1811396">"the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia. "</text>
            <text syncTime="420.472" offset="1826234">And similarly, the Second Amendment to the Constitution recognizes that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, and under the Constitution, Congress is empowered to call up and historically has often called up the militia, the State National Guard, in time of war to provide for the common defense, and indeed at this time many of the nation's combat-ready units are included in the state militias.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.671" offset="1922991">Thus, we believe the state as a state, under our Constitution, has an interest in encouraging its residents to serve in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.092" offset="1952666">Similarly, during or just before a time of war, a military draft becomes a greater probability than would otherwise be the case, and of course much more important than would otherwise be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.150" offset="2004911">Under our draft laws, quotas are set for each state based on the number of eligible persons in that state and based on the number of eligible persons nationwide, and a state under the Selective Service laws gets credit for the number of persons currently in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.861" offset="2071785">Thus, we believe that the state may validly seek to encourage volunteer service both in order to assist the nation and to assist the state in meeting its quotas under the national defense system, and similarly may seek to minimize the burden on non-volunteers who may be providing important services to the state or to the people of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.608" offset="2154750">It seems to us that a critical error in the Second Circuit's opinion is to assume that because New York might have an interest in encouraging service of all residents of the United States in the service, that therefore it is illegitimate for New York to concentrate its efforts on its lesser included interest, namely, encouraging its own residents to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.954" offset="2244088">No doctrine of which we are aware holds that a state offering prospective incentives for participation in a national program such as the draft must make those promised benefits available to all persons residing outside their borders, and as a practical matter, New York law targets the residents of the State of New York, simply because it is not much of an incentive to enter into the military service for a teen-ager in Nevada, to be offered public service employment in New York after service in wartime.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.861" offset="2379716">The New York law also compensates veterans, as Justice Rehnquist indicated, and compensation is certainly one of its most important purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.300" offset="2421512">Again, the Second Circuit viewed that purpose purely retrospectively, failing to recognize, we submit, that promise of compensation is so important incentive to military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.208" offset="2465189">Even if one were to concede that rewarding veterans after the fact for military service at some point in the past is not a legitimate state purpose, it does not follow, it seems to us, that promising to reward them in the future for such military service doesn't serve a legitimate state purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.819" offset="2535615">That purpose, we submit again, is encouraging service in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.204" offset="2553169">An additional important purpose that the New York law and the New York constitutional provisions are intended to fulfill is to encourage skilled veterans to come home and to serve in the public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.929" offset="2599981">A wartime veteran, as I am sure this Court is aware, acquires skills and experiences which make that person a very desirable employee, whether for government or for anybody else, and we would of course concede that that is true of all veterans, whether they reside... whether they have ever resided in New York or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.058" offset="2672497">Nonetheless, we believe that New York has a valid interest, unrelated to any desire to reward its own people, to encourage former residents to come back to New York after time of war and to engage in public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.681" offset="2718995">I think it's important to focus on the group that New York is targeting with this provision, entirely apart from the questions, that the incentive purpose of going into the military for the person who is drafted, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.310" offset="2785555">The group New York has always targeted with the statue is the group which is by definition is uprooted, New York residents who have gone to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.099" offset="2816693">Whether or not they have done so, again in reliance on the promise of preferential consideration at a later point, it is reasonable for the State to give them some encouragement to return home and New York, beyond that, is interested not only in getting residents to return home but to engage in public service when they do so, and this Court has frequently indicated that a state's interest in maximizing the quality of its public work force is an important one which may justify restrictions that otherwise might be constitutionally doubtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.987" offset="2948245">Quite arguably, based on this Court's decisions, New York could not constitutionally make such distinctions after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.474" offset="2978234">An example is that New York could not declare in 1946 that state residents... that persons who had gone to college in New York State in 1961 would receive tuition assistance grants, because that would discriminate against persons who had become residents of the State of New York subsequent to 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.221" offset="3061199">But we submit there is no doubt that prospectively in 1981, New York could have adopted tuition support grants to persons who were residents in the state at that time, as this Court's decisions is that area have made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.314" offset="3113548">We certainly concede that New York could have drafted this statute and could have framed its constitutional provisions in such a way as to more closely and more precisely retained its objectives, and perhaps the plaintiffs in this case in fact are as well qualified as some other people who received a preference under New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.762" offset="3215321">But the distinction New York makes, we submit, is a rational one in view of the critical incentive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.233" offset="3237264">New York's constitutional provision does encourage service both in the military and in civil service employment, and those are legitimate objectives and this Court has frequently said that--</text>

            <text syncTime="802.402" offset="3353875">It is an incentive purpose that has historically been given for the statute, and whether... we don't know whether this constitutional provision encourages one or 100 people to do that, but I think it can clearly be said to do that in some number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.348" offset="4969705">This is an action brought by two individuals who had been residents of the State of New York for more than ten years before applying for the veterans' preference credits here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.338" offset="5001679">Ultimately one of them did obtain civil service employment, as do many non-residents and non-resident veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.776" offset="5035429">But this Court's decisions, I think, make clear that the claimed penalty on the right to travel has to be examined on a case by case basis in view of the objectives of the statutes and the requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.751" offset="5087360">New York's Constitution as noted seeks to encourage several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.405" offset="5109930">Anyone contemplating service in the military during wartime or any other time is free to move to the state to help the state fulfill that purpose, if they subsequently wish to collect that reward, and in terms of the right to travel, we submit that that is the critical time and the three-judge Court opinion in August against Bronstein, we submit, was correct in analogizing this situation to this Court's decision in 1973 at the time it was deciding these durational residency cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.274" offset="5233437">In Spatt against New York, it was a summary affirmance of this Court upholding the restriction of New York State tuition grants to New York residents only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.982" offset="5272203">We submit that the claim that the plaintiffs advance in this case is analogous to a claim that might be made on behalf of the California resident who, having gone to a state college in New York at some previous time, subsequently moved to New York to claim the tuition refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.526" offset="5342420">The claimed inequality doesn't exist because it ignores the incentive purposes of the law, the purpose of the law in the tuition situation being to encourage state residents to go to state colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.869" offset="5403755">Her right to travel, we submit, would not be penalized by such a limitation because she was free at the time she lived in California to move to the State of New York to obtain state scholarship assistance if she wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.063" offset="5464568">I would point out one more thing about the statute, and that is that it's in terms of the right to travel that its effect is quite modest, as Judge Friendly described it in that opinion I mentioned a moment ago, and dissipates over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.786" offset="5515455">It's a provision that can be used on one occasion for one appointment and that the class of veterans who are eligible for this benefit is steadily diminishing, I would point out, because for the past ten years at least no one has been able to satisfy the requirement of service during time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.415" offset="5582015">Thus, this case is not like the Zobel case, we submit, where there was an ever-increasing class of persons who were given preferential treatment based solely on their length of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.623" offset="5630812">Again, in terms of the right to travel, we believe that Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Zobel illustrates here why there was no denial of the right to travel, for the same reason that there was no denial of equal protection, and that is that the State's concern was not solely with rewarding past conduct, whether... or past contributions whether those contributions were defined or undefined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.588" offset="5722658">Here, as that concurring opinion put it, the business of the state was not with the past or with the present, and one such item of business which the Court... which that opinion noted was filling current needs, and we submit that New York's statute and New York's constitutional provision are clearly aimed at doing so and do not depend entirely on a post hoc past contributions rationale to support them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Kimerling</label>
            <text syncTime="1514.148" offset="6200908">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.069" offset="6216582">Let me briefly review the facts here as they assist in our understanding of the irrationality of New York's veterans' preference system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.325" offset="6253571">In order to qualify... be treated as a veteran in New York, you must, one, serve in the armed forces during time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.681" offset="6291083">Two, you must be honorably discharged from that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.566" offset="6306547">Three, you must pass a civil service examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.703" offset="6323161">Four, you must be a present resident of the state of New York and fifth, and lastly, you must have been a resident at the time of induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.059" offset="6360568">It is this past and present residency requirement that is at issue here, and which denies the plaintiffs here from being treated as veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.331" offset="6393587">Plaintiff Baez Fernandez entered the armed forces from Puerto Rico and served from 1958 through 1960, at which time he was dishonorably... excuse me, honorably discharged and entered the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.989" offset="6444265">He moves to New York in 1968, settles in New York, and in 1970 he's called up from the reserves, serves in active duty, is injured, and receives a service-related disability, but he's not a veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.350" offset="6513750">If he had not joined the reserves but had come to New York and then re-enlisted in 1970 he would have been treated as a veteran, but because he did his patriotic duty and stayed in the reserves he's not a veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.425" offset="6562025">The result of that, in 1981 and in 1982 he's denied three appointments, which his ten points as a disabled veteran would have gotten him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.512" offset="6594312">Those appointments were cancelled when it was learned that he entered the service from Puerto Rico and not from New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.916" offset="6620017">Mr. Soto-Lopez entered the service also from Puerto Rico in 1961 and served through 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.688" offset="6647079">Also this was in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.754" offset="6655334">The 1973 service of Mr. Baez-Hernandez was his time of war service during the Vietnam era.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.092" offset="6676650">Mr. Soto-Lopez, after serving during the Vietnam era, in 1965 comes to New York, settles and becomes a resident of the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.014" offset="6712386">Thus he's a veteran serving during time of war, honorably discharged, present resident for 15 years, and then in 1982 is denied being treated as a veteran because he had not been inducted from New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.762" offset="6791380">The original defendants here were agencies of the City of New York who would have been plaintiff's employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.348" offset="6813741">They have not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.765" offset="6819383">The appellant is only the Attorney General who intervened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 24-03-B, solely to defend the constitutionality of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.573" offset="6866613">None of the relief that plaintiffs have obtained or have sought runs against this appellant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.785" offset="6935471">And let me amplify on that if I could, a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.922" offset="6951981">This question, that is whether or not the 24-03 grants standing in this situation has never been resolved by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.646" offset="6998897">It was raised previously in this Court and a decision in 1943 in United States versus Johnson, but left unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.383" offset="7029826">The issue is very simply that there is no case of controversy between the plaintiff and the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.906" offset="7063889">The case of controversy is between the plaintiff and the City of New York but was not appealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.083" offset="7232640">--Well, let me continue then, if I may, briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.435" offset="7242044">I think what helps assist this Court is reaching the issue, whether or not there is justiciability, is the Muskrat case, one of the first cases that dealt with advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.993" offset="7292304">In Muskrat, as this Court recalls, Congress tried to set up a jurisdictional provision to allow for the tests of constitutionality of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.466" offset="7334204">In Muskrat, in 1902, Congress granted certain Cherokee Indians rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.037" offset="7356461">In 1904 and '06, those rights were diluted by giving additional people benefits that the 1902 people had for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.012" offset="7400346">So, in 1907 Congress said, let's see whether this subsequent legislation, 1904 and '06 legislation, is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.701" offset="7439112">So, it said, we grant jurisdiction to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.503" offset="7454368">We grant jurisdiction to the Supreme Court on appeal to hear a claim by four plaintiffs who are the beneficiaries of the 1902 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.091" offset="7492715">They can come to court as class representatives of those people, and the defendant shall be the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.881" offset="7527824">This Court in Muskrat then said there was not a case of controversy under Article 3, as the United States Attorney General did not have sufficient interest under Article 3 to create a case of controversy in regard to the real interest of the plaintiffs in the Muskrat case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.563" offset="7614550">I think, in addition, this Court might want to look at the Boston Towboat case versus United States which is a 1943 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.518" offset="7658436">The Boston Towboat Company, the company that intervened in a lower court case between the Cornell Steamboat Company and the United States, the ICC, the ICC had said that Cornell is covered by the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.547" offset="7730534">Boston intervened in that case because it was a tugboat company in Boston, Cornell... there was a tugboat company in New York harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.855" offset="7767733">It intervened, obviously, to hope to avoid a precedent which would say that tugboat companies should be covered under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.543" offset="7806498">After an adverse decision against Cornell, the Boston Tugboat Company, the intervenor, appealed to this Court and this Court denied and dismissed the appeal saying the intervenor who had come in solely because he was concerned about the precedential value as it would run against him, and indeed he was in court in Massachusetts against the Interstate Commerce Commission, there was no appeal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.278" offset="7909421">And, I should point out that there was cast granted to the Cornell Steamboat Company at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.265" offset="7933349">Lastly, I think that the other case that helps in resolving this question is maybe the earliest decision about advisory opinions, the Hay-Burns case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.582" offset="8986606">As I started to say, I think that the issue here is what interest if any does the State of New York have in differentiating between its past and present... between its resident veterans based on past and prior residency, whether New York must show a compelling state interest or a substantial interest or must meet some lesser standard, need not be decided by this Court, as New York had been unable to articulate even a legitimate state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.153" offset="9108964">The Court's decisions recently in Hooper and Zobel make it clear that states cannot legitimately distribute rights and benefits based on prior and past residency, and that's what's at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.556" offset="9446570">The retrospectiveness should be distinguished from after the fact, or retroactive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.960" offset="9480111">Indeed, in Hooper the Court noted that one of the purposes of encouraging resettlement in the state could not have been served because there was retroactive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.854" offset="9531729">But, what the Court noted in footnote 8 of that opinion was, it did have, although not raised by the parties, some prospective effects, some encouraging effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.075" offset="9568614">It encouraged people who had moved to the state before '76 to remain, it encouraged people who had lived in New Mexico prior to '76 to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.615" offset="9606753">So, it did have prospective effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.300" offset="9613545">Yet, the Court said in that footnote, it still could not meet the constitutional barrier because it still distinguished people based on past or prior residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.173" offset="9653042">In Zobel as well, I think if you look at the concurring opinions there, although the majority opinions did not reach the issue, the concurring opinions indicate that those... Alaska could have said, okay, in 1980 we're going to start distributing benefits and anybody who is a resident in 1980 has got one share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.236" offset="9737261">By 1981 you've got... people who are living in 1980 have got two shares and the person that moves in 1981 has got one share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.508" offset="9774355">This would not have, obviously, changed the results of the concurring opinions since it would still have relied on past or prior residency for distributing benefits, albeit prospective legislation... it is not the after the fact nature of the legislation but rather, it's retrospective looking back at past or prior residency which is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.873" offset="9871844">And that's exactly how New York's legislation is like that in Hooper and Zobel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.443" offset="9898070">Let me turn to what New York argues very strenuously, is the purpose here, and that is to encourage service in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.287" offset="9953450">It's not quite that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.620" offset="9958779">They're arguing, it encourages enlistment in the armed forces because they argue that at the time of enlistment we vest or distribute rights to future benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.845" offset="10003710">That's their argument, and therefore they say, that's a crucial juncture in time, and therefore we can vest, you know, we can impose a bona fide residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.700" offset="10039132">But, let's look... it's clear that that is not what is happening here in these provisions, and even if it were, it still wouldn't meet constitutional master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.520" offset="10070374">Look at the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.139" offset="10076853">It doesn't define these as enlisted benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.591" offset="10086675">It doesn't define an enlistee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.891" offset="10091899">The provisions define a veteran, and the criteria for obtaining these benefits is not enlistment, it's service in the armed forces and honorable discharge and passing the Civil Service examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.679" offset="11794978">But, let me go back to this retroactivity issue because I think it's parallel to what this Court looked at in Hooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.001" offset="11828310">In June of 1973 the New York State Legislature said, the Vietnam War is over, March 1973, the war is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.959" offset="11880137">Therefore if you enlist from now on, there are no benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.677" offset="11894975">In 1983, it retroactively amended to be May of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.415" offset="11913992">Many of the men and women who enlisted in '73, '74 and '75 were not encouraged by this legislation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.119" offset="11944817">They were discouraged if anything by New York's statement that the war was over in Vietnam, yet as of 1983 they are the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.627" offset="11982851">So, I think it's clear that this new refinement, albeit of the Attorney General, really doesn't mesh with what the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.165" offset="12024960">It is not what anyone was talking about then in terms of vesting benefits at the time of enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.040" offset="12064457">I've spent a good deal of my time on the equal protection arguments and how these provisions violate plaintiff's rights under the Equal Protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.646" offset="12106880">Let me turn briefly to the right to travel provisions, because I think under those provisions as well, New York State veterans' credit provisions fail to meet constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.155" offset="12160902">When states set up categories of present residents and then they distinguish among them based on past or prior residency, they distinguish based on newly migrated versus older residents, and these kinds of distinctions are the very kinds that the right to travel most appropriately deals with, and the right to travel here is substantially penalized and substantially burdened contrary to the appellant's suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.941" offset="12284095">Veterans' credits mean often the difference between unemployment and employment in a Civil Service career with all the attendant securities and benefits that those kinds of careers lend themselves to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.065" offset="12332578">Not only can these credits be used at the entry level point, but veterans optionally can use them on promotional examinations, and finally at the time of layoff, a veteran is entitled to as many as five years additional seniority at the time of layoff to allow them to withstand layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.277" offset="12397466">So, these are substantial benefits, certainly more substantial than the $50 at issue in Zobel, and therefore the right to travel has been burdened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.000" offset="12440307">If we apply the equal protection analysis, New York must meet the compelling state interest test or at least some heightened scrutiny, and unable to articulate even a legitimate state purpose, they obviously cannot meet the compelling state interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.594" offset="12502688">If we evaluate it under the privileges and immunities clause of Article 4, again New York State could not meet the two part test there, having been... they are not able... certainly not even attempting, but certainly not able to demonstrate that plaintiffs are some kind of evil, as I have already indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.271" offset="12565382">They have all the attributes of every other veteran, and therefore there is no reason to exclude them and certainly the provisions here are not substantially related to the exclusion of them from civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.143" offset="12604879">And lastly, if we had a balancing test that sort of looked at the state's interest in restricting the right to travel or burdening it versus the rights of free interstate travel and the benefits to be attained by that, New York's inability to articulate a legitimate state interest simply would allow the scales to tip in favor of equal treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.089" offset="13084696">The reason I say that is in the Camden County case, the Construction and Building Trades Council of Camden County, this Court raised an issue as to whether or not limits on public service jobs could... that excluded nonresidents could survive a privileges and immunities challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.950" offset="13160137">It said it still had to go through the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.985" offset="13172258">It didn't say it would clearly survive because a state's interest in civil service only being the state civil service and therefore benefiting only its own residents, or whether or not it would not survive a privileges and immunities challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.329" offset="13225653">But, it said that the question had to be answered, and that's why in terms of post-residency requirements, there is a question on the privileges and immunities clause which is very distinct from the prior residency requirements we are talking about and how that really goes to the heart of the right to travel and the heart of the equal protection clause, and the equality of citizenship that comes from someone who migrates to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.874" offset="13599830">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.174" offset="13605055">Just on the retrospectivity point, New York has, as I have mentioned, both a constitutional commitment and a statutory commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.014" offset="13648418">Part of the reason for having these provisions in both places is that it's obviously necessary for the Legislature frequently to define and redefine time of war, but also New York wanted to emphasize the fundamental nature of its commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.358" offset="13705783">Obviously, any statute which has a requirement of service during time of war must at some point be amended to define that time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.380" offset="13749878">I'm sure the State of New York would have preferred to define prospectively in 1967 the end of the Vietnam War, but of course it was unable to do so, so that built into any such requirement is that... is the obligation of the State Legislature at certain points in time, to define time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.043" offset="13828454">What New York did here, unlike what New Mexico did in Hooper against Bernalillo, is frequently during the Vietnam period to define time of war as including the past six months, the past year or whatever, and it did that repeatedly through the course of that time, and indeed those frequent amendments to the New York statute show the depth of New York's commitment to this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.159" offset="13920928">Just to answer Justice Powell's question about the Vietnam War and its being an undeclared war, New York's provision on this tracks very closely, as does New York statute, the federal provisions which define veterans' benefits in terms of time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.387" offset="13993862">Congress... the relevant federal statute speaks of the Vietnam era, and the President declared several times during the course of the early '70s the end of the Vietnam era, and for statutory purposes that sufficed under federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.214" offset="14053212">New York adopted the same terminology as far as treating the Vietnam era as a time of war, since the federal government had done the same thing, in essence.</text>
