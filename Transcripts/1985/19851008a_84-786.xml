            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="128942">Mr. Moss, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="99.445" offset="526630">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="103.304" offset="542095">This is a criminal case from Maine involving a Massiah issue of whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applied to a post-indictment meeting between Respondent Moulton and his friend, Gary Colson, a co-defendant, on theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.060" offset="613148">The central question here is whether the Massiah/Henry rule should be extended to the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.527" offset="643032">There are two factors here which are important, distinguishing this case from Massiah and Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.008" offset="664870">First, Moulton himself, not the police, created his incriminating situation relative to the pending theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.333" offset="698202">Second, the police here put the body wire on Colson as part of a legitimate investigation into a new crime which was Moulton's plans to murder a key state's witness, Gary Elwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.391" offset="754418">In light of these two factors, there is no deliberate elicitation here, because, as the Court said in Henry, the police here did not intentionally create the situation inducing Moulton's incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.556" offset="815126">I would like to address each of these two factors in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.867" offset="828397">First, as I said, Moulton himself, not the police, created this incriminating situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.771" offset="852011">Moulton initiated all the contacts between himself and Colson, including the meeting in which he incriminated himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.049" offset="881060">Respondent concedes that it was Moulton who did arrange the meeting in which Moulton incriminated himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.952" offset="908749">Moreover, Moulton, on his own initiative, put on the agenda for that meeting a complete discussion of their trial strategy and the perjured testimony that Moulton wanted them to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.214" offset="953784">Just further evidence that Moulton himself created his own incriminating situation is that some of the statements at the meeting were made without any questioning or promoting by the informant Colson at all and other statements that he made in response to Colson's questions, that Colson asked those questions within the role that Moulton had created for him which was to review discovery materials and prepare a perjured defense for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.702" offset="1063708">Additional evidence that this Moulton/Colson meeting was not a government-created confrontation is that here Colson was the one who initiated contact with the police to complain about threatening telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.901" offset="1120446">This is not a case where the police sought out the informant to investigate pending charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.852" offset="1144269">The second important factor here is that the police placed the body wire on Colson as part of their legitimate investigation into a new crime, Moulton's plans to murder a key state's witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.516" offset="1194947">The suppression hearing justice below in fact found that the police were involved in this legitimate purpose of investigating a new crime and put the body wire on for that purpose and also to protect Colson's safety and not to gather evidence on the pending charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.541" offset="1263074">This finding is entitled to some deference because it was the suppression hearing justice below who heard the testimony firsthand, observed the demeanor of the witnesses and found both the police and the informant Colson to be believable.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.675" offset="1335590">The Maine Supreme Court found ample evidence to support the justice's finding and Respondent, as I have said, concedes that there was a legitimate purpose here for this investigation into murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.951" offset="1380730">The police were making every effort here to comply with Massiah while investigating the proposed murder and this is evidenced by the police instructions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.166" offset="1421585">Prior to this Moulton/Colson meeting, the police instructed Colson, the informant, to act like himself, converse normally, and avoid trying to draw information out of Moulton.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.693" offset="1471636">The police consulted with the local District Attorney's office before giving these instructions and the instructions themselves are consistent with Massiah and show a good-faith effort to comply with it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="354.325" offset="1546242">No, he did not elicit comments and the reason why he did not elicit comments is because those were statements that either Moulton was going to make anyway or that those questions that Colson asked were questions that Moulton required him to ask in order to develop the perjured testimony that Moulton wanted him to give.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="380.534" offset="1651045">Yes, and the reason that our Maine Supreme Judicial Court disagreed is because our Maine Supreme Court assumed that simply by putting the body wire on the informant that the state somehow created the incriminating situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.637" offset="1723456">Our Court also used a foreseeability test and that is because it was foreseeable that the defendant and the informant would be having conversations about pending charges and that the defendant would be making incriminating statements in this conversation, that because this was foreseeable this also violated Massiah and Henry.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.046" offset="1861069">Yes, it would have been admissible at least insofar as it would have showed any consciousness of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.684" offset="1887610">It certainly would have been relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.292" offset="1894088">And, also it would be admissible for Sixth Amendment purposes as well because, at least as regards to the murder, Moulton was planning to commit the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.975" offset="1936824">There is no right to counsel for new crimes that someone is planning to commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.396" offset="1954483">Therefore, it should be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.832" offset="1964201">Another reason why the murder evidence would be admissible, which also goes to why all this other evidence should be admissible as well, is that there still has to be a government-created confrontation for there to be a Sixth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.733" offset="2015819">And, the state's position here is that Moulton in this meeting was just continuing a discussion of ideas that he had originated in the telephone conversation which he also initiated leading up to that meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.844" offset="3120276">But, there is no problem with that unto itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.122" offset="3133337">In Brewer versus Williams, one of the Massiah progeny, the Court, in fact, said that no constitutional protection would apply simply because the defendant is making statements to an agent of the state as long as there is no interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.507" offset="3194882">What the state is, in fact, contending here is that there was no interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.911" offset="3220586">I would add as well that the reason the police put the body wire on Colson was to investigate this proposed murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.860" offset="3252351">Now, the police had every obligation to investigate that murder because somebody else... As a matter of fact, the key state's witness, his life was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.074" offset="3301148">The police had a responsibility to investigate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.463" offset="3310761">And, what the police were trying to do with Colson was to use him to investigate the murder while simultaneously having him avoid interrogating the defendant regarding the underlying theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.412" offset="3366558">On the other hand, Colson was entitled to protect his cover as an informant, therefore, he had to play along with whatever Moulton had arranged for this meeting simply to be able to protect his cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.156" offset="3417549">And, the state's position is that the questions that Colson asked were questions that he was required to ask in order to be able to go along with the defendant's own plans to develop this perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.870" offset="3464361">I would add as well that some of the incriminating statements... and this is just further evidence that Moulton created his own incriminating situation... that some of these incriminating statements were made without any questioning or prompting by Colson at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.333" offset="3526219">So, certainly they are not the result of interrogation and they should not be subject to any Massiah challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.284" offset="3550042">There is another factor here that... Well, the Maine Supreme Court, as I mentioned earlier, they used the test of foreseeability to find a Massiah violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.154" offset="3613468">The problem with that test though is... defendants and informants, just by the nature of informants, it is generally going to be foreseeable that defendants and informants when they get together, that the defendant might be making incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.833" offset="3680237">That, however, does not mean that the government has created a confrontation with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.112" offset="3705314">In fact, it is the very foreseeability of those statements, that just when a defendant and informant gets together or a defendant and co-defendant gets together to talk about their case that there might be incriminating statements made.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.748" offset="3751917">It is the very foreseeability of that situation which means that, indeed, the government hasn't done anything to try and elicit those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.665" offset="3787548">So, although the Maine Supreme Court used this test of foreseeability, the state's position is that it is the very foreseeability of those statements that indicates that this was not a government-created confrontation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="945.887" offset="3912413">Yes, it is, because the should-have-known aspect of the Maine Court standard seems to get away from the fact of whether the police were actually deliberately going after statements on the theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.818" offset="3972181">And, the Sixth Amendment standard is that deliberateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.598" offset="3987332">The test which the Maine Court applied sounds more like an objective test that would be more akin to Rhode Island versus Innis and the statement that is used for custodial interrogation under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.483" offset="4050862">And, this Court has already said... It said it in a footnote, I believe, in Rhode Island versus Innis, that when you are talking about Sixth Amendment deliberate elicitation and Fifth Amendment interrogation, they are really two separate concepts, because when you are talking about Fifth Amendment custodial interrogation, you are talking about the pressure that is already put on the defendant that is inherent in a custodial situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.049" offset="4169040">Therefore, anything which the police do which they should have known about that would prompt any statements the police are going to be taxed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.953" offset="4196730">However, in the Sixth Amendment context, we really are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.607" offset="4211358">We are talking about deliberate actions by the police that actually destroy the adversary aspects of the trial itself, that destroy the right to counsel that is available for trial and that, in fact, reduces the trial itself to a formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.147" offset="4273425">So, in the Sixth Amendment context, we really are looking at have the police done anything intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.583" offset="4295264">And, the state's position is that the combination of the two factors that we have in this case, Moulton himself, not the police, created this incriminating situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.580" offset="4327238">Good faith investigation of the police shows that the police here did not intentionally create the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.845" offset="5408289">No, there were no charges brought on the new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.924" offset="5416544">As I said though, it is a closer case though when there is no bona fide investigation into the new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.905" offset="5452488">And, I think at that point an important factor to consider is the first factor that we are relying on here and that is that whether the police created an incriminating situation and then other factors would also have to be looked at to determine whether there is a Massiah violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.568" offset="5527198">At least one other factor would be what type of instructions did the police give the defendant at that point and another factor, which was an important factor in Henry, is did the police give the informant any incentives to deviate from their instructions, because the problem in Henry was that the contingent fee arrangement with the informant, in fact, gave the informant some incentive to deviate from the instructions in Henry which were to avoid questioning Henry, because the contingent fee arrangement was that he would be paid in exchange for any information he gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.678" offset="5667633">But, that is not this case, because here the police were investigating a new crime and they did not give the defendant any incentives to go ahead and investigate the pending theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.252" offset="5713922">As I said, the body wire was to investigate the new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.501" offset="5726878">Although admittedly there was a deal here in that charges were dropped against Colson... that is the new charge, not the pending theft charge, but rather new charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.810" offset="5768152">No new charges would be brought against Colson in exchange for his cooperation; that is his testimony at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.980" offset="5796782">That was in exchange for his eye witness testimony at the trial, in exchange for what he actually saw, what he actually did with Moulton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.710" offset="5823740">That deal had nothing to do with actually a continuing investigation to gather evidence against Moulton on the pending theft charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.128" offset="5857386">The respondent also refers to the fact that Colson had not yet been sentenced and that somehow this gave him an incentive to go ahead at this meeting and to ask Colson a lot of question to ingratiate himself with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.513" offset="5922901">I would point out that the record nowhere supports that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.964" offset="5940769">There was no sentencing deal here with the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.289" offset="5962085">There was nothing said that the informant... that the state would recommend a lighter sentence in exchange for gathering evidence on the pending charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.193" offset="5993641">To the extent that the sentencing means anything at all, it means that it gave the informant an incentive to follow the police instructions precisely, which was to be himself and avoid drawing information out of Moulton, and also the open sentencing gave Colson an incentive to continue to do what the police wanted him to do, which was to investigate the proposed murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.371" offset="6086323">Those were the incentives that Colson had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.338" offset="6098235">So, the state's position here is that, at least for Sixth Amendment purposes, there really was no interrogation and there really was no elicitation; that Moulton's incriminating statements were the product of a situation which he himself had created that should not be charged to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.518" offset="6174931">Respondent says that the... given the foreseeability of the defendant's incriminating statements at this meeting, he somehow implies that the state somehow had some duty to protect against the foreseeability of those statements, but that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.990" offset="6304811">The Sixth Amendment protects against government-created pre-trial confrontations in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.566" offset="6327172">Where the defendant has created the pre-trial confrontation through misplaced confidence in someone who is really working for the state, then the Sixth Amendment does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.733" offset="6375864">The police are not obligated to protect the defendant from his own inability to keep quiet and that is especially so here where the defendant was planning new crimes to obstruct justice, perjury and murder, for which there was no right to counsel anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.538" offset="6903015">And, we feel that this type of action which the state agent did was deliberately eliciting questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.526" offset="7790970">The agent is an arm or the state and a task has to be set up, instructions have to be very definite, because this investigation as to whether it is a new crime or an old crime can get very confusing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.655" offset="10707489">And, a passive listening post, the Court suggested in Henry, does not unto itself constitute a government-created confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.522" offset="10934963">And, as the state has already said in its main argument, just the body wire without more does not constitute a government-created confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.304" offset="11234118">And, there would be no problem with admitting those statements, because Moulton had no right to counsel for them anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.920" offset="11332547">They did not... In contrast to Henry, they did not give Colson any incentives to go in and deviate from their instructions and question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.383" offset="11374447">And, the body wire itself, as I have said, if anything, indicates that the police were trying to comply with Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.569" offset="11403182">Given the good faith of the police here, the deterrent rationale of the exclusionary rule which is to deter purposeful, intentional police misconduct, would simply be inapplicable.</text>
