            <label>Mr. John J. De Franks</label>
            <text syncTime="96.562" offset="517786">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the present case on a writ of certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals stems from an action under New York's public health law to abate a nuisance allegedly occurring at respondent's book store premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="580898">In the trial court, respondents moved for summary judgment, arguing that the closure provision of the public health laws constituted an impermissible prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.112" offset="619977">The motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.528" offset="625620">The denial was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.396" offset="641084">The New York Court of Appeals, however, found the law, the closure provision, that is, to constitute an unlawful prior restraint upon respondents' First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.871" offset="687060">The issue as we see it before this Court is twofold: firstly, whether the closure provision amounts to any regulation of speech: and secondly, if it does, is it not a valid time, place, or manner restriction?</text>
            <text syncTime="154.797" offset="750694">We argue initially that closure does not restrict speech in any form, oral or written, pure or symbolic.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.069" offset="795834">Closure would be the result of criminal conduct which my opponent concedes has no expressive element.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.692" offset="826345">Neither the complaint nor the law generically is concerned with control of any content, and the Court of Appeals specifically so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.316" offset="868768">The exercise of First Amendment rights could never bring this law to bear against the respondents, and that is exactly what distinguishes this case from every other case cited by both sides in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.076" offset="927804">In all of those other cases, it was the exercise or intended exercise of First Amendment rights that put the individual on a collision course with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.932" offset="971272">In this case, no matter what he says, no matter what he sells, legal or illegal, it could never result in a proceeding for closure.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.059" offset="1035742">Would a single occurrence of an illegal act on the premises of a business without the knowledge or consent of the owner amount to a violation so that it could be declared a public nuisance?</text>

            <text syncTime="299.524" offset="1329672">The present case is like that of a publisher, say, who is incarcerated for conduct unrelated to his publishing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.297" offset="1368751">Surely his incarceration incidentally affects his freedom to publish, but would anyone suggest that he be entitled to an O'Brien analysis on the date of sentencing?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.188" offset="1416294">I would think not, because the penalty is unrelated to his First Amendment activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.907" offset="1739168">As I was suggesting earlier, there is no causal connection, and in this case the exercise of their right to disseminate sexually explicit materials could never bring the law, the closure provision down, against them, and this closure provision does not prohibit relocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.952" offset="1819311">In and of itself, it is not concerned with where the respondents move to to continue in their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.474" offset="1857450">Respondents deny this.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.526" offset="1869675">They say we are left with no option.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.262" offset="1888588">They cite an ordinance that they never raised in the Court of Appeals below, the Kenmore adult use ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.465" offset="1913352">However, that ordinance on its face indicates that he may move to an alternative location, and as the maps we have provided indicate, the alternative locations are ample and reasonable in light of the fact that the village of Kenmore is a ten-by-eighteen-block village, wholly consumed within the town of Tonawanda, which is 15 times its size, and which also allows alternative sites for adult uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.587" offset="2033933">That the sites wight cost respondents sore than they are willing to spend is of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.889" offset="2055145">As this Court stated in Renton, economic impact, which is the only real impact here, economic impact is simply irrelevant to a First Amendment inquiry, but if we would have assumed that economic impact somehow translates into a restriction on speech, we would argue that this is a legitimate time, place, or manner restriction, a legimitate place restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.556" offset="2169770">The law is content neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.158" offset="2176144">It is unconcerned with content.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.610" offset="2185966">It is interesting that when the law went to the Court of Appeals, it was neutral in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.728" offset="2202475">When it returned from the Court of Appeals, the bookstore had been accorded a privilege that we assume might not he accorded to a car dealership or a pharmacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.053" offset="2663798">Under our first analysis, we would contend this is not a First Amendment case at all, and this would only be our secondary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.059" offset="2699742">In fact, the closure here would have no more effect on respondents than the termination of their lease, the taking of the property though eminent domain, or a tax foreclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.758" offset="2794619">It doesn't take the property for all time, and it allows for a discretionary release of the property for good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.161" offset="2828160">Now, if that release is denied in New York, that denial would be reviewed by an appellate court, if the respondents so desired.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.049" offset="2947696">I think in this case it is clear that the government's interest would be served better with closure than without it, because closure prevents the recurrence of the conduct, whereas injunction would admit the possibility of recurrence and punish after the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.296" offset="3144764">This is contracts that by the 19 references to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Footnote 3 where the Court of Appeals specifically stated, we are adjudicating the First Amendment question, and as this Court is aware, there is no First Amendment in the state of New York, speech is accorded protection under Article I, Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.475" offset="3237447">In conclusion, I point out to this Court that the law does not seek to control or censor the content of any of the materials the respondents are disseminating.</text>
