            <text syncTime="67.145" offset="414318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="71.049" offset="429887">Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, which I will call Transco, is an interstate pipe line company regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.592" offset="480146">It purchases gas in the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and off-shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.729" offset="508672">It transports that gas for resale in markets stretching from Alabama to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.227" offset="534586">For many years prior to the spring of 1982, this interstate company, along with many other interstate purchasers, were purchasing gas at a period of time when there was a severe shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.049" offset="593936">They were able to take all of the gas that their contract producers could deliver to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.639" offset="620267">Their contracts provided that they could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.747" offset="636672">The contracts did not obligate them to take all of that gas, it only obligated them to take a certain minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.105" offset="658197">These long-term contracts were part of the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.743" offset="680662">These contracts provided for minimum-take obligations and take or pay obligations if those minimum takes were not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.520" offset="723817">However, in the spring, particularly May of 1982, it became apparent to the gas industry as a whole particularly that there was becoming a surplus of deliverability of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.777" offset="812842">There was a loss of market for a number of reasons that I will not take my time here, the drop in the price of oil, surplus oil, for many reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.288" offset="858922">But, there was an unprecedented, an unforeseeable loss in the markets for natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.629" offset="884208">That created a problem whereby the interstate pipe line companies, and Transco in this case, could not then purchase all of the gas that was required to be purchased under its contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.166" offset="974383">They could buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.635" offset="976264">They could buy it if they had the money.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Marshall Grower</label>
            <text syncTime="209.509" offset="983787">The pipe line is not the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.337" offset="991101">The pipe line is the conduit to the market and if the market can't take it, they can't buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.507" offset="1007715">It is that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.460" offset="1011581">Now, when they were unable to buy all of their contracted gas, they had to cease buying gas from owners that they had no obligation to purchase the gas from.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.066" offset="1054004">Now, these owners in East Morgantown and Greens Creek field areas of Mississippi, Coastal and others, had chosen not to commit their gas to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.200" offset="1106563">In 1978, '79 and '80, when the long-term contracts in this field were made with Getty, Harkins, Florida Gas, and others by Transco, of course, there was a shortage and these particular producers chose not to commit their gas to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.223" offset="1190572">All indications were that for the foreseeable future prices were going to continue increasing, oil prices were going up, the market was going to expand, everything look rosy.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.297" offset="1234876">There was no need to commit their gas they thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.843" offset="1245116">I assume they thought that.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.858" offset="1253162">They didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.296" offset="1254938">So, in essence, when the axe dropped and they were no longer able to sell their gas to Transco at the high prices being received by the contract producers under those 1979 and '80 contracts, they sought relief from the Mississippi Oil &amp; Gas Board pursuant to Rule 48 of the Board which required the ratable taking of gas from the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.815" offset="1376982">It was a state-wide rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.018" offset="1381789">The Board enforced that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.688" offset="1392447">The Board required Transco to take the non-contract gas and to take it without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.888" offset="1441243">The impact, the consequence of that order was to displace contract purchasers, because, as we said in the beginning, the market is limited, they cannot take any more than the market could take, so if they are required to take non-contract gas, they have got to cut back on taking some contract gas, the effect of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.517" offset="1543748">What is the effect of that state order, because I am not sure I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.828" offset="1569035">Did it require Transco to take more gas or simply to spread the payments around for the gas that it did take?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.339" offset="1611039">The effect of the order, Justice O'Connor, was to increase... take or pay payment for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.585" offset="1648029">I will explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.148" offset="1654298">In that the contracts required a certain minimum take.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="382.379" offset="1675196">Well, if you could answer my question it would help me understand your response.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.829" offset="1693064">Did the state order require Transco to take more gas or simply to spread the payments out to a broader group of people for the gas it did take?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_marshall_grower" startTime="399.825" stopTime="459.599">
            <label>Mr. John Marshall Grower</label>
            <text syncTime="399.825" offset="1744995">The effect of it was to ultimately require the taking of more gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.464" offset="1767565">That was the practical effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.462" offset="1775611">Because of the take or pay requirement... this is complicated and difficult for me to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.007" offset="1801733">I know it is not difficult for you to understand, but these contracts require take or pay which in essence the cost of making take or pay payments are a flow through to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.549" offset="1843947">It increases the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.252" offset="1846768">But, that take or pay may be recouped in a five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.547" offset="1863905">And, if that gas can be recouped, it is only recouped out of the excess above the minimum take.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.934" offset="1893475">So, we are either going to pay for the gas twice if we can't recoup it or when we are catching up and producing above the minimum we are going to have to produce more gas from that contract while at the same time producing the non-contract gas that the state requires us to take.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="459.599" stopTime="478.386">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="459.599" offset="1984172">Well, right now, I suppose, the court below remanded for a determination of what price ultimately would have to be paid for these other pool owners, so we don't even know what it would cost ultimately, I gather.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_marshall_grower" startTime="478.386" stopTime="499.269">

            <text syncTime="478.386" offset="2059301">Your Honor, we know what it would cost from this standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.261" offset="2074765">The take or pay payments under the high-cost contracts... Those contracts at this time were $7.90.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.241" offset="2110710">So, when you have to pay for gas you can't take at $7.90, that increased cost increases substantially.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.669" offset="4376362">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.543" offset="4391931">This case very squarely raises the pre-emption question as the continuing vitality of Northern Natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.259" offset="4422755">The facts, as Mr. Grower stated, are essentially the same statutory scheme, either comply with the state ratable take order and take more gas than it was able to need for its customers or take less gas under its take or pay provisions and incur costs with the ultimate result being, as Northern Natural said, that that could seriously impair the Federal Commission's authority to regulate the intricate relationship between the purchasers' cost structures and eventual cost to wholesale customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.434" offset="4551487">The question, and the state courts quite clearly recognized, that the decision would go in favor of Transco in that case if Northern Natural was still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.976" offset="4593596">The divergence, the difference was that Northern Natural, the courts found, was not good law by virtue of their reading of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.034" offset="4629854">Our reading, on the contrary, is totally to the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.533" offset="4643856">We believe that both under the Natural Gas Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act that the Northern Natural case has continuing validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.452" offset="4679487">Let me turn to the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.825" offset="4693070">There are two kinds of things under that statute which I think indicate the continuing nature of non-state intervention and effective federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.852" offset="4737165">As you know, this was... The Act was to set up a nation-wide market in gas because of the problems that had arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.223" offset="4766631">And, what Congress did under the Natural Gas Policy Act in Title I was statutorily fix the prices, statutorily fix... detail the prices for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.110" offset="4806128">FERC no longer had any authority under that to fix those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.935" offset="4825459">But, in addition to that kind of scheme... In addition to that, FERC did have specific authority under Title VI of the Natural Gas Policy Act to prohibit the pass through of such gas costs which is found to be the product of fraud, abuse, or similar grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.008" offset="4897766">So, what you had was just the opposite of a commission of state intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.600" offset="4916156">You had a free market under Title I which FERC could not interfere with as you pointed out in the Mid-Louisiana opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.003" offset="4949697">And, on the other hand, you had FERC's control to assure that gas costs... that pricing practices of pipe lines are not fraud, abusive, or invalid on similar grounds from passing through.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.587" offset="5196084">And, this, I think, pinpoints the concern in Maryland v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.695" offset="5212489">The concern is that we regulate interstate pipe lines under the Natural Gas Act and in Mid-Louisiana it was made crystal clear that while FERC has no continuing regulatory control on the prices under Title I, it has continuing control, as it always had, under the relationship of the pipe line to its downstream customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.327" offset="5295036">So that rather than Northern Natural in our view losing vitality by virtue of the Natural Gas Policy Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act has established a free market, no state interference with whatever authority exists, exists in FERC under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.992" offset="5373717">To the extent there is additional authority, it exists under the prudent standard of the Natural Gas Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.276" offset="5638808">Northern Natural said you cannot deal with the interstate pipe line, you can only regulate the producer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.023" offset="5677782">Many states have adopted market demand where denominations are made by the pipe lines and it is based on... Even Texas has monthly kinds of crude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.566" offset="5723967">That may pass constitutional muster because what the state is doing then, it seems to me, is taking care of its own mining interest, protection of waste, protection of the owners of the pool, which clearly, Your Honor, the states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.029" offset="5781854">We have never taken the position, and I don't take it now, that the states do not have significant rights over their minerals within the state and natural gas is such a mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.728" offset="5820620">The problem is that to the extent the state action intrudes upon the federal structure the state action must fail.</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Gates Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="1571.135" offset="6430318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.259" offset="6442752">Before coming to my submission, I would like to address the question that Your Honor raised about take or pay payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.241" offset="6462710">Take or pay payments are refundable pre-payments for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.568" offset="6475980">A fundamental assumption is that during the period of a 20-year contract that there will be significant periods of time during which a purchaser will not need all of the gas that the producer can deliver, but at the same time the producer needs some sort of cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.889" offset="6545257">So, if and where and the parties agree, they agree to include a take or pay provision which provides that if you get to the end of a contract year and the pipe line has not taken all of the minimum quantity that it agreed to, it will pre-pay for the balance and it will recover it either in kind or in cash under cash balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.585" offset="6616101">If, at the time the take or pay obligation is called for, they cannot make up the gas, if they are being called to pre-pay for, then they have a contractual defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.143" offset="6658315">Now, as interesting as all that is, it has nothing to do with what the state has required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.640" offset="6680257">Forget the exaggerations that have been made about what the State of Mississippi has required and look at pages 14 and 15 of our brief and how our Mississippi Supreme Court has construed this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.059" offset="6725919">The requirement is not that a pipe line has to take the first MCF of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.073" offset="6742011">It is that the pipe line when and if... this is on 14 and 15 of our brief... when and if a pipe line decides to take gas from a pool, then whatever quantity it wants to take, it must offer to take those quantities ratably as among the different wells in the pool so they are not taking 100 percent out of one well and 10 percent out of another one, which is virtually the example we had in this case, and they must offer to pay a market price unless the parties agree otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.060" offset="6853919">The parties are free to agree to two cents, two dollars, or twenty dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.075" offset="6870011">But, in the absence of that agreement, if somebody wants their gas taken so that no drainage occurs, the state is not going to allow drainage to occur simply because somebody is being obstinate about the price that ought to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.993" offset="6913688">They called for a market-responsive price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.678" offset="6924450">And, as we point out in our brief, Transco has been complying with this by offering a market-out clause price since December of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.614" offset="6956215">Now, let me get to the issue which is pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.066" offset="6966037">We submit that Under Section 601(a) of the NGPA Congress clearly eliminated FERC's Section 1(b) jurisdiction over wholesales of deregulated natural gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.013" offset="7021730">Consequently, the states are once again free to attach a reasonable ratable take requirement to any purchaser's takes of deregulated gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.259" offset="7062795">I want to explain why Mississippi's requirement is not pre-empted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.477" offset="7075647">I want to explain the inconsistency of FERC's position in this case and why producers need this simple protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.630" offset="7100202">It is a question of implied pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.004" offset="7113786">No one claims that this state power, ratable take power, is pre-empted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.003" offset="7133743">FERC... it is briefed on page 15... concedes that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.968" offset="7149626">It is a question of implied pre-emption; that is in passing the NGPA did Congress intend to prohibit the state from attaching reasonable conservation requirements to takes of deregulated gas or did Congress intend to create a gap into which the states could not step with their conservation powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.226" offset="7230605">We submit that Congress didn't either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.991" offset="7237710">First, look at the legislative history and look at the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.332" offset="7255056">Congress intended that the states would play a major role in what was the overriding objective of Congress to increase the supply of natural gas available to the interstate commerce and end the perpetual shortages of gas in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.014" offset="7317750">Congress vested the states with broad powers under Section 503 to make these fundamental determinations that would determine what price you got if it was regulated gas or whether it was going to be deregulated gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.884" offset="7369263">As importantly, the legislative history reflects that the &lt;NGPA&gt; [= NGPA] was not to intrude on the states' historical conservation powers or their traditional conservation functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.610" offset="7624218">I was going to point out that in the legislative history Congressman Dingell in submitting the NGPA to the House made this statement on October 14, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.512" offset="7667790">He said that the legislation does not contemplate that FERC will intrude into the traditional conservation functions performed by the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.818" offset="9265021">In other words, even in Phillips, this Court acknowledged that after Attleboro and after the Natural Gas Act was passed, the constitutional restrictions on the ability of the states to regulate activities that impacted interstate commerce had been loosened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.640" offset="9320297">It was recognized in Phillips and a perfect example is the Peerless case in which this Court upheld the ratable take minimum price order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.378" offset="9595209">And, if you look at Pike, that is the same test that the Court has applied under the commerce clause and that is exactly my point; that since the NGPA eliminated Section 1(b) jurisdiction which was a codification of Attleboro, since they eliminated that, there is no statutory pre-emption question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.871" offset="9673263">It is a question of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.416" offset="9683399">If you apply the commerce clause test to Pike, which, under another name it was applied in Peerless, this simple state requirement passes that test, because there are strong interests in the state and it is consistent with the policy of Congress in encouraging more producers to get involved in the process of drilling more wells, discovering new gas, and offering that gas and making it available for sale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.234" offset="9794680">That is all this rule does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.498" offset="9807741">Let me turn to FERC's conflict claim with this perspective in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.904" offset="9825296">At the time of the Northern Natural decision, we had a pervasive scheme of federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.526" offset="9847866">Producers could not sell into interstate commerce without FERC authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.258" offset="9866778">Pipe lines could not bid for gas, there were no deregulated sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.320" offset="9882974">It was truly regulated from the well head to the burner tip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.348" offset="9895095">It was because of that... The Court in Northern Natural cites Attleboro and they rely on Section 1(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.549" offset="9927905">They rely on Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.064" offset="9933965">They say because of that pervasive scheme there is a likelihood or an imminent possibility of collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.873" offset="9961237">If you go back to Northern Natural, the Court did not require an actual conflict be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.638" offset="9980254">The recent decisions of this Court have made it clear that the Court is no longer content to settle for these speculative, hypothetical possibilities of collision which brings me to FERC's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.743" offset="10028737">All they have been able to offer in the way of an alleged conflict is that this state requirement might in some way conflict with their Section 601(c) powers which is the power not to prevent somebody from buying gas, but the power to deny a pass-through of a payment for fraud or abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.798" offset="10092894">There is nothing about this requirement that prevents the exercise of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.718" offset="10108568">If they can, with a straight face, stand up here and claim that the payment of a market price is the result of fraud or abuse, then they have still got the power to deny the pass-through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.511" offset="10147751">The same holds true for the take or pay payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.010" offset="10157782">If they claim that a take or pay payment that somebody makes and then tries to pass-through as the result of fraud or abuse, they can deny that pass-through which brings me to this closing point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.146" offset="10202295">Without the protection of this simple rule... producers are not dumb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.705" offset="10244509">For the same considerations that they sought the protection of the intrastate market before the NGPA was passed, where they could get a better deal, they will seek the protection of an intrastate market in which they are not treated like this, in which the Coastals of the world, the one percent owners, whether they are professionals, whether they are farmers who have leased, will not be treated like this, or the state will resort to more disruptive measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.678" offset="10348476">In other words, the state could come in and completely shut in the field until every owner had a contract signed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.238" offset="10378674">It would be disruptive, but it would clearly be within the conservation powers to prevent waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.142" offset="10398318">It will discourage producers from competing against one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.578" offset="10416081">Independents... All the world of oil and gas is divided into independents and majors and if the independents end up with the contracts and the majors... the majors end up with the contracts and the independents are left to scramble for themselves, they don't compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.040" offset="10473864">More fundamentally though, this practical observation: If because of the NGPA a producer and a pipe line can agree like they did in the case of the Florida Gas contract, that we will take all owners' gas regardless of whether they are signed up and we will take their gas ratably, and there is nothing FERC can do to prevent that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.862" offset="10549201">If they can contract for that protection, which they can, and nobody denies it... They did it in the Harkins contracts in the states, they did it in the Florida Gas contract, then there is nothing to prevent the state in the exercise of its conservation powers from stepping in and providing that minimal protection where the parties fail to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.697" offset="10632479">One question has come up about, well, is there a better way that the states can handle this, the so-called market demand allocation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.960" offset="10661528">That is a gimmick and a game which Mississippi decided in 1948 that we are not going to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.114" offset="10686187">It serves only one or two purposes, allowing the pipe lines to run the state allowable system or getting the state involved in a socio-economic decision that you pipe lines tell us how much gas you want to buy and we will dole it out among the different pools in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.077" offset="10746060">That is not a conservation function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.138" offset="10758285">The purpose of that rule is not to protect owners in a given pool from drainage and it is not to give owners in a pool an opportunity to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.290" offset="10794857">It gets the state intruding even more so into contractual affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.195" offset="10814501">Mississippi has a pure allowable system and to the claims that the market demand allocation system is the best way to go, I refer the Court to the Texas Law Journal article which cites that the blue ribbon panel appointed by the Texas Railroad Commission to investigate the question of unratable takes found that under their own system of market demand allocations that unratable takes were still occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.200" offset="10918572">While some people might think that that is the best way to go, Mississippi has chosen a pure allowable system in which, based on maximum efficient rate of flow of wells, they set the ceiling and the pipe lines are free to come in and take 100 percent, one percent, 50 percent, they can vary their takes at noon and at midnight.</text>

          <turn speaker="ed_davis_noble_jr" startTime="2735.277" stopTime="2928.528">
            <label>Mr. Ed Davis Noble, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2735.277" offset="11086801">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.650" offset="11100280">My purpose is to explain what the legitimate state interest of the State of Mississippi is with its Rule 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.600" offset="11136120">We believe that it encourages the development of its natural gas by protecting the correlative interest of each owner, operator, and producer in a particular pool, but more importantly, Rule 48 also satisfies the statutory requirement that the Oil and Gas Board at least attempt to conserve the natural gas in the State of Mississippi; that is to prevent drainage as it has been defined by co-counsel, waste and reservoir damage caused by unratable and disproportionate withdrawals of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.758" offset="11284809">The requirements of Rule 48, in effect, are practical and consistent with the congressional goals of the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.770" offset="11320858">And, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, it encourages the participation of all the owners, operators, or producers in a particular field and encourages them to develop the state's natural resources by permitting just compensation for their efforts in the development at a fair and current price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.525" offset="11415839">Now, if the primary objective of the NGPA is to increase the supply of natural gas in intrastate, then we say that 48 is consistent with the federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.441" offset="11467457">That is because it corrects what could be a potential market failure in the sales of gas at the well head in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.422" offset="11511448">That can occur when you see a situation which we have and that is very few purchasers in a field where there are multiple owners, operators, and producers, thereby creating a market situation of perhaps less production and lower prices offered than would be in a perfectly competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.646" offset="11612280">Further, the producer would be without a purchaser and, therefore, would suffer a risk under the rule of capture which exists in oil and gas and that is he would see his property extracted without compensation, and, therefore, it would conflict with the rule and the law of correlative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.244" offset="11722726">As this Court is aware, NGPA makes no provision for the protection of the small, independent, non-contracting owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.787" offset="11764835">Well, Rule 48 provides for that such protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.066" offset="11781972">It does so merely because it provides that if you participate and if you do purchase the Rule only says that you must at least offer, no more than offer, to purchase the gas at a reasonable or current price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.903" offset="11853338">Now, if--</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.728" offset="11868594">--That is if there is no contract, that is correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.352" offset="11883118">Let us assume that that particular owner, operator, or producer refuses, what can he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.114" offset="11914151">Then he merely runs the risk of being able to recover his property; that is his oil or natural gas that he owns at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.751" offset="11964724">Rule 48 merely gives him the opportunity or protection of being able to recover during the purchase time at a fair rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.262" offset="12010804">If the producer is not permitted to purchase and to sell and to get his fair market price at the time in which the pipe line does, in fact, purchase, then there is a possibility that since he will not be compensated, then he would seek other markets in intrastate, thereby defeating the purpose of NGPA by reducing by whatever means the particular oil and gas which might flow into intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.823" offset="12172972">The State of Mississippi does not mandate taking by strict allowables or production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.600" offset="12216127">It is that the Oil and Gas Board sets maximum allowables for a specific period of time which means that if you do produce in the State of Mississippi you can take anywhere from the well being shut in, that is zero, to the maximum allowable with would be 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.918" offset="12313407">We would suggest to the Court that in doing so we have, in effect, a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.869" offset="12341201">The producer is ready to surrender his gas to the pipe line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.492" offset="12367741">The pipe line determines what it wishes to take and if it takes within the allowables according to state law in a particular field, it may take from zero to 100 during that period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.224" offset="12842648">In allowing for a fair market price and creating a market in interstate commerce, we would also suggest that Rule 48 protects the consumer.</text>
