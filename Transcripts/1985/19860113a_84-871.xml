            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Malone</label>
            <text syncTime="9.768" offset="186935">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.770" offset="206997">It is here on three petitions for writs of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.965" offset="227790">They have been brought by California, Ohio, and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.107" offset="240329">And there is a separate appeal which has been instituted by the state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.218" offset="256734">The issue raised by these cases is whether the 1934 Communications Act empowers the FCC to preempt the state's regulation of depreciation in accounting matters for local telephone ratemaking purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.198" offset="316711">From 1934 to 1983, the FCC did not attempt to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.273" offset="340953">It took the position that the Act as written deserved a system of dual, that's state and federal regulation over these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.729" offset="370837">So this dual regulation took hold, and a primitive telephone network eventually became the most technologically advanced, efficient, and reliable system in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.883" offset="411483">Then in 1983 the Commission took a new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.037" offset="428097">It found at the behest of the utility industry that the Act as originally written not only allowed but required preemption, and that even if its new reading of the Act was inaccurate, it still could preempt because a failure to do so would frustrate the implementation of its general responsibility to maintain an efficient interstate telephone network.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.062" offset="520153">So it told the states to base local rates on its perception of the correct way to depreciate and to account for the costs in plant which are assigned to the states under the long accepted separations principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.112" offset="580339">Now, that decision, if upheld by the courts, will require local telephone customers to pay very substantial telephone rate increases with no assurance that a single dollar of those added payments will go to fulfilling the purpose for which the FCC preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.442" offset="645645">That is, plant modernization.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.013" offset="655989">On appeal, the lower court, the Fourth Circuit, had affirmed by a two to one vote, and it has done so based not on agreement with the Commission's new reading of the Communications Act, but rather on this implied preemption theory, the syllogism that competition will breed a need for plant replacement or accelerated depreciation, and that can be facilitated by preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.268" offset="745015">The lower court should be reversed for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.331" offset="757240">The first is that it ignores the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.383" offset="769465">It ignores the fact that Congress back in 1934 carefully constructed a jurisdictional boundary which divided the FCC's jurisdiction from that of the states, and in doing so preserved to the states local depreciation and accounting regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.572" offset="834144">Now, depreciation by definition is the recovery of a capital asset over its life.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.058" offset="856192">So in sitting down to set up depreciation accruals, a company manager or a regulator asks him or herself three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.192" offset="888688">Is this cost or is this asset depreciable?</text>
            <text syncTime="188.264" offset="900913">That is, they classify the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.706" offset="910736">The second question is, what is it worth?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.017" offset="919931">What is its value?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.199" offset="924737">That is the valuation of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.189" offset="932678">And the third question is, how long is this going to live, because I want to allow the company to recover this capital value over its life, and that is the process that results in the calculation of a specific depreciation percentage.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="209.319" offset="985132">That is straight line depreciation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_malone" startTime="211.950" stopTime="359.527">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Malone</label>
            <text syncTime="211.950" offset="995686">That is straight line depreciation, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.152" offset="1004567">Now, having developed this percentage, you then simply apply that to the capital asset and derive specific dollar and cent depreciation charges to recover each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.817" offset="1047199">The fundamental flaw with the FCC's position that it is able to preempt and able to set local depreciation charges is that each of these three functions, each tool involved in this task has been denied the FCC by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.769" offset="1118984">First, let's look at valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.380" offset="1129433">Section 213 of the Communications Act empowers the FCC to value plant, but Section 213(h) expressly and unequivocally provides that the states retain the power to value the plant which is under their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.762" offset="1198918">So, certainly if the FCC cannot dictate to the states the value of the plant which is subject to intrastate regulation, then they can't dictate the specific depreciation accruals which are designed to reimburse companies for the value of that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.524" offset="1266001">In other words, the FCC order assumes unto itself a power expressly denied it by Section 213(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="287.058" offset="1296094">Let's look at the other two functions, classification of the property and the development of these specific depreciation percentages to apply to the property's value.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.306" offset="1337158">Well, the government, the FCC argues that Section 220(b) of the Act, and that is the general depreciation and accounting section, gives them the authority not only to set up classifications and these specific depreciation percentages for the plant under their jurisdiction, but it also gives them the authority to set up classifications and percentages for the plant and the assets under the state's jurisdiction and authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.852" offset="1447291">That is the new reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.063" offset="1452202">That is the reading that they never took from 1934 to 1983, and that the Fourt Circuit was not willing to embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.360" offset="1481354">But they argue that Section 220(b) expressly authorizes them to take over these two functions, but when one reads Section 220 in its full context, with particular reference to Section 220(j), one sees that Congress did not give them the authority to classify plant or to develop depreciation percentages with respect to the plant in the state's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.535" offset="1582082">Now, of course, this is--</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="359.527" offset="1586053">Mr. Malone, what kind of physical plant or equipment are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.170" offset="1608623">Is it telephone instruments?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Malone</label>
            <text syncTime="367.601" offset="1618340">--It could be telephone poles, Your Honor, telephone lines, all of the plant which really goes into... the vast majority of the plant which goes into the provision of telephone service.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.739" offset="1658882">Certainly there is a certain amount of plant which is assigned solely to the provision of intrastate service, but what we are dealing with here is the FCC's attempt to take over the costs mainly which are devoted to jointly used plant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="395.090" stopTime="402.774">
            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="395.090" offset="1728264">And jointly used plant means plant whether it is telephones or lines or both that are used for both intrastate and interstate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_malone" startTime="402.774" stopTime="544.597">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Malone</label>
            <text syncTime="402.774" offset="1758984">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.176" offset="1764626">Now, if one considers the fact that in 1934 the vast majority of this plant was valued on a fair value basis, and fair value is attune inextricably to the length of lives, it really makes no sense that Congress would have ever told the states that you can value the plant but say to the FCC with the states valuing it, you can assume how long it is going to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.352" offset="1869325">That is like asking two people to drive a car at one time with one person having their foot on the accelerator and the other person steering.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.367" offset="1901403">It just couldn't possibly work.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.638" offset="1910494">But the FCC here is saying that it has the power to classify this property, and really its position misreads Section 220(j).</text>
            <text syncTime="451.705" offset="1954693">Now, that was a provision, Your Honors, which caused a great deal of dispute in the enactment of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.591" offset="1982278">The Senate wanted a 220(j) which would have assumed preemptive powers with the FCC, and would have called for a study to look into the reasonableness of undoing these powers, and the House wanted a 220(j) which would have expressly prohibited preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.069" offset="2040166">So, a conference committee was called, and it ultimately gave both sides part of the loaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.523" offset="2058033">It gave the House the continuation of the status quo, which in 1934 was dual regulation with the states regulating these depreciation and accounting functions for local matters, and it gave the Senate a direction, not a request, but a direction to the FCC to study this dual regulation, and to come back and tell us whether it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.708" offset="2142775">If it is causing problems, do a study... whether it is causing problems or not, do a study, and come back to us, and if it is causing problems we will give you new legislation to give you preemptive authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.525" offset="2190004">But 220(j) clearly evidences Congress's position that the Act as written left the states with this power because it envisions a need for new legislation to harmonize what it describes as state and federal powers, not practices, but powers over depreciation in accounting matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.488" offset="2269834">So, the three functions, the classification of the property, its valuation, and the development of specific depreciation percentages to apply to that value in order to determine dollar and cents accruals are all reserved to the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.597" offset="2326259">Well, Mr. Malone, one section you rely rather heavily on, I guess, is 152(b), and that talks about prohibiting Commission jurisdiction over charges, classifications, at cetera, in connection with interstate communications service.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.727" offset="2394804">Now, when you have got a telephone pole out there that has wires on it that are used both for intrastate and interstate, do you say that that section means that you allocate a part of that pole to intrastate service?</text>

            <text syncTime="598.242" offset="2540881">By the same token, if you have a central office switch serving an area such as Tampa Bay, which is growing, and a central office switch serving an area such as Green Bay, they are subject to very different technological obsolescence, growth, very different factors that go into the development of these service lives and these depreciation percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.973" offset="2611829">And Congress back in '34 wisely recognized that the state regulators on the scene were best able to take measure of these differences and to set meaningful depreciation charges in accounting classifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.356" offset="2741292">Let's assume we have a telephone pole that costs $100, and we assume that 75 percent of that pole's usage is devoted to intrastate services and 25 percent is devoted to interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.983" offset="2787790">What we do is, we assign the states responsibility for dealing with the $75 on that pole, and the FCC is responsible for dealing with the other $25.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.217" offset="2988724">So, clearly the threshold question with respect to that provision is, do these terms, charges, classifications, and practices refer to local or intrastate matters?</text>
            <text syncTime="719.203" offset="3024669">Because if they do, the FCC is violating 152(b) as well as 213(h) and 220(j).</text>
            <text syncTime="726.068" offset="3052149">Now, charges, classifications, and practices traditionally have been used to refer to depreciation charges or classification and accounting classifications or practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.876" offset="3095408">Congress in fact in Section 220, which is the lynchpin for the FCC's preemption theory in this case that general depreciation and accounting statutes uses the term "charges" seven times to refer to depreciation, and it uses the term "classifications" to refer to accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.206" offset="3160714">Academicians, state regulators, the utility industry, the FCC, and before it the ICC have all consistently used these terms found in Section 152(b) to refer to depreciation and accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.155" offset="3212541">So, I don't think there is any question that if we read 152(b) consistently with its general usage, that it prohibits preemption by preserving to the states and to their jurisdiction regulatory control over local depreciation charges and accounting classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.606" offset="3278370">But how does the FCC... how does it answer these claims?</text>
            <text syncTime="786.459" offset="3293730">How did the Fourth Circuit answer them?</text>
            <text syncTime="787.860" offset="3299372">Well, the Fourth Circuit did not give a great deal of attention to the law because it went on to Section 151 and the implied preemption theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.985" offset="3331869">But on appeal, the respondents have argued that Section 152(b), although by its express design it refers to all of Title 2 other than the pole attachment statute, and therefore would refer to Section 220, and although Section 152 uses the very same terms as appear in Section 220, they argue that it has no relevance to depreciation accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.251" offset="3428940">They claim that the terms charges, classifications, and practices refer to rate structures or rates for services, but their position ignores the fact that that statute uses very different language than Congress had intended to just refer to rates for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.382" offset="3497485">It says that the FCC cannot assert jurisdiction over charges, classifications, and practices for or in connection with local rates, and it is the in connection with language which clearly encompasses depreciation and accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.181" offset="3560597">Their position also in claiming that it has no reference to 220 and simply refers to rate structure attributes extreme redundancy to Congress by assuming that Congress used six terms to mean one.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.899" offset="3607513">With respect to Section 220(j), and that is the provision again which calls for a study by the FCC to look into the reasonableness of harmonizing state and federal powers over depreciation, they argued that that provision was nothing more than a paraphrase of the Senate pro-preemption 220(j).</text>
            <text syncTime="882.751" offset="3678879">But again, that statute belies their position, because it calls for the harmonization of state and federal powers, and clearly by calling for the harmonization of powers, it assumed that the states did have powers under the law as written, a position directly contrary to that which formed the basis for the preemption order.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.782" offset="3751082">With regard to Section 213(h), they haven't answered us, and frankly, we can't criticize them for not doing so, because our position on that evolves from our analysis of allegations made by the respondents in their briefs concerning Section 213(h), GTE in particular, so they haven't had an opportunity to respond on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.536" offset="3830076">But we have here two very different readings of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.360" offset="3853377">We have a reading by the states which, of course, is consistent with the reading that the FCC took for its first 50 years which has all of the pieces of the legislative puzzle fitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.116" offset="3892352">They are structurally coherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.578" offset="3898203">They supplement one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.050" offset="3904159">Each word in each statute has a meaning, and we had the respondents' reading, the new reading, which has pieces in the legislative puzzle clashing.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.644" offset="3934461">They conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.305" offset="3937178">You have Section 152(b) referring clearly to other provisions of the Act, including Section 220, but under their position having no relevance to Section 220.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.513" offset="3977929">You have six terms of art in Section 152(b), according to their position, meaning only one term.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.657" offset="4002484">You have Sections 220(h), referring to waivers, and Section 220(i), a notice statute, as proposed by the states, directly at odds with Section 220(j) as originally proposed by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.805" offset="4051176">In other words, their new reading of the Act violates a number of rules of statutory construction, but the Fourth Circuit was still willing to preempt, and it did so by reasoning that even though this increase or this order by the FCC is really designed to increase local rates, that is still justified because it is going to further general responsibilities found in Section 151 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.804" offset="4167160">But that sort of reasoning, as the lower court dissent indicated, really allows an agency to overreach with its general purpose language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.029" offset="4204045">It invites an agency to hold general purpose language such as 151, which really has no legislative history to it, and simply tells the FCC, go and regulate interstate matters, to hold that language up to the light and to manipulate it until it is able to derive a stream of unstated purposes which are really predesigned to conflict with the state law to be overridden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.673" offset="4286592">And that process is particularly bothersome when it overrides historic, deeply routed police powers which preexisted with the states at the time that the Communications Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.752" offset="4342912">We don't think that this Court has ever endorsed this sort of stepping stone or bootstrap preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.185" offset="4364646">Indeed, in the Pacific Gas and Electric case, this Court indicated where Congress has clearly evidenced a willingness to tolerate dual regulation, there is no basis for implying preemptive authority in an agency to preempt in order to avoid the effects of the dual regulation which Congress has indicated a willingness to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.910" offset="4443536">What we have in this case is a classic example of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.106" offset="4740287">We don't accept that assumption for several reasons, one of which is that depreciation is but one of many factors, and it is far down the list on the list of factors which affect a management's decision to modernize plant or to replace it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.287" offset="4801100">Certainly rate of return, the trading value of stock, interest rates and all of these other factors are much more important in the equation, and if the FCC is allowed to preempt on a deeply routed police power based upon this guise of plant modernization which it was able to derive from its general responsibility by the power of its imagination, then where do we draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.110" offset="4892319">What can't it preempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.983" offset="4899842">What the FCC is really doing by asking the Court to adopt this general responsibility language as a gateway to preemption is inviting a trolley ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.760" offset="4938922">It is one way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.233" offset="4964835">But Section 220(j) of the Act tells the FCC that if it has problems with dual regulation, it isn't to do away with it by administrative order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.253" offset="5204953">By the analogy I was referring to the fact that the FCC is attempting to tell the states, in fact the very purpose of its order is to tell the states what dollar and cent depreciation accruals have to be included in local rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.774" offset="5274961">Now, Section 213(h) preserves to the states the power to classify property or the power to value property, and the valuation of property... picture yourself attempting to determine what a telephone pole is worth under a fair value jurisdiction, which was the brunt of the jurisdiction back in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.128" offset="5360433">One question you would ask yourself is, how long is it going to last?</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.959" offset="5375793">Their position is that the states can go out... well, they haven't conceded this, but Section 213(h) clearly provides that the states would go out and ask that question, how long is it going to last, to determine the value, but that the FCC would come in and tell them how long it is going to last for the purpose of developing depreciation charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.004" offset="5447891">And that is inconsistent, and that is what I meant when I referred to on person on the accelerator and the other person on the wheel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.658" offset="7010536">Now, we are talking about the physical integrity and the modernity and the financial soundness of the very channels of interstate communication, and what depreciation is about is paying for physical equipment as it wears out, technologically or physically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.631" offset="7086396">And all that the preemption order sought to do is to make sure that the preemption calculations were made in as accurate a fashion as possible, and that is very important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.044" offset="7160061">I am sorry, the depreciation calculations, Justice White, that the depreciation calculations were made in is accurate a way as possible, that they reflected as accurately as possible what in fact was happening to those assets out there in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.526" offset="7225994">Now, all of these assets are used both in inter and intrastate communications because, as Justice Burger said when he was on the D.C. Court of Appeals, in terms of facilities, we have one integrated system, and when the switch fails in a local exchange or a telephone pole which is rotted blows down, the effect is as much on interstate as it is on intrastate communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.277" offset="7357024">Now, the basis for what the FCC did here is, as Mr. Malone pointed out, first of all in Section 1 of the Act, Section 151, in which the FCC has an overriding mandate to make available to all the people of the United States rapid, efficient nationwide facilities at reasonable charges, and Section 220(b), which says that the Commission shall prescribe depreciation charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.779" offset="7487010">Those are the two statutory bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.689" offset="7502683">Now, let me address some of the concerns that have been raised apart from the concerns about rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.005" offset="7531940">First, there is a very real concern about federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.908" offset="7551584">It is an important concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.430" offset="7557645">It is one that we share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.191" offset="7568721">But here, unlike some other cases the court has had to consider, there is no setting of the state's regulatory agenda, no mandating of state procedures, as one Justice has put it, no kidnapping of the state procedures at all, just the familiar instance of federal law supplying one of the determinants in an element in a calculation which otherwise goes forward wholly according to state procedures and concerns.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1888.302" offset="7701109">But, Mr. Fried, your opponent argues, and I would be interested in your response to this, but if you could take care of this one element, what about all the other elements, such as rate of return, and rate base, and other factors that go into rate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.299" offset="7749070">Could you take over those as well?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1902.723" offset="7758788">Well, in this case, though the Court of Appeals spoke in terms of Section 1, the Commission was very assiduous to rely on Section 220(b), which specifically spoke about depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.313" offset="7833184">So, if there is a slippery slope here, the FCC has not sought to put its foot on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.547" offset="7858053">It has rested firmly on Section 220(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.221" offset="7880832">Now, Section 152(b) is... 2(b)(1) is the one which causes most difficulties for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.992" offset="7935898">And here I must say we read the legislative history rather differently from petitioners because what we see happening, happened back there in 1934 was that the state commissioners were alarmed about federal intervention in depreciation, and sought from the House a provision, 220(j), sought a 220(j) which would block any federal effect on intrastate depreciation rates, and they failed to get that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.114" offset="8080407">What they got seems to me to look like a typical face-saving compromise which gave them some sort of compromise language, but not at all the substance of what they were seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.536" offset="8146027">Now, the language also of 152(b) does not do what petitioners claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.829" offset="8175180">The petitioners read 152(b) as if it said, if you have a facility which exists in both interstate and intrastate communication, then the fact that it exists in intrastate communication precludes federal jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.183" offset="8252607">That reading is a reading which has been consistently urged upon the commission and consistently rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.529" offset="8286043">It was first urged and first rejected back in 1947, when the Commission began its long trek towards the situation which now obtains where you can buy your telephone rather than having to rent it from the phone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.581" offset="8366187">And what the Commission did to bring about that result, and of course it doesn't obtain just in respect to the telephone you have in your home, but it relates to private exchange systems, to all kinds of complicated computer equipment and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.172" offset="8436613">What the Commission did was to mandate that the state commissions remove from their tariffs any requirement that customers pay for and lease their phones from the phone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.865" offset="8511323">Now, that telephone, which you now can buy because of the FCC orders, that telephone is used 97 percent, it is estimated, in intrastate communication, yet the remaining 3 percent is crucial to interstate and was found to be sufficient for a federal regime about customer terminal equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.278" offset="11344982">The facilities in question are telephone poles, lines, and switching systems along with the buildings that house them that are used jointly in interstate and intrastate communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.018" offset="11399944">The FCC, as it has for many years, is determining the percentages, the useful lives, the depreciation formulas so that in the end you say of a telephone pole, this pole will last five years, it must be depreciated at 20 percent a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.738" offset="11474863">And what the states are saying is that they are entitled with respect to this same telephone pole to say, no, it is going to last ten years, depreciated at 10 percent a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.876" offset="11515405">It is exactly the case of two hands on the steering wheel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.507" offset="11581965">It has been prescribing depreciation for about 95 percent of the telephone plant in the United States since the late forties and early fifties, and the states have in fact with very rare and unimportant exceptions followed those depreciation rates in intrastate proceedings because you are talking about depreciation of exactly the same facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.473" offset="11677782">You cannot in fact have accurate depreciation for the telephone pole, mathematically cannot do it except by one in a billion chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.780" offset="11714980">You have two different regimes of depreciation, two different formulas for the same physical facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.513" offset="14433909">There is a letter from the FCC appended to the Louisiana brief which says to the state of New York, we know you have deviated from our rates and you have every right to because you have jurisdiction over these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.342" offset="14489289">It is in black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.403" offset="14493469">It is signed by the secretary of the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.714" offset="14502768">It is appended to the Louisiana reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.426" offset="14513635">At Page 45 of the California petition, the appendix to the California petition, the FCC says unequivocally, the states have the right, they have the right to deviate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.765" offset="14571000">They have done so for 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.988" offset="14579882">We have no right to tell them to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.568" offset="14586151">I think the history is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.100" offset="14592316">Justices Rehnquist and Stevens asked, is it not true that accountants have differed over depreciation and accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.055" offset="14624081">The answer is clearly yes, and so has the FCC, and the FCC admits that at Page 23 of the joint appendix, where it says there is no right or wrong to depreciation, and the suggestion by the telephone industry here today that unless there is one regulator setting depreciation charges, we won't have accurate depreciation is belied not only by the FCC's statement at Page 23 of the joint appendix, which it made before attempting to preempt, but also the fact that there are a number of telephone companies who are not here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.146" offset="14748528">Part of the Bell System, Pacific Telephone and Telegraph, they are not supporting this preemption case, because in those states the FCC is setting rates faster--</text>
