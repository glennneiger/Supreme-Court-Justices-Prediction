            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="73.988" offset="437652">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. Heath was indicted in Georgia for the murder of his wife after joint investigation between Alabama and Georgia officials for capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.308" offset="490942">The same day that he was indicted, a notice of aggravating circumstance was filed by the state, which is the method by which Georgia indicates its intent to seek the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.986" offset="529603">Some time later, he pleaded guilty to that murder, and we now reach a factual nuance that will take me a minute or so to explore of some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.170" offset="562413">In the state's brief they assert in Pages 10, 31, and 32 that the defendant pled guilty to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.064" offset="593969">That is not supported by the record, and if it is supported by the record, it causes the state a bit of a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.109" offset="618106">The record shows that he pled guilty to murder, and then it is uncontradicted that he went through what is called the unified appeals procedure, which is the method by which Georgia... these are hearings by which they decide if the death penalty is to be imposed, and subsequently a life sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.320" offset="682994">I think the reason the state asserts that he pled guilty to the life sentence is they indicate or at least argue that he was never in jeopardy for his life, whereas in fact the record supports that he was, but more importantly, suppose the government is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.646" offset="732313">Suppose the state of Alabama is correct that he did plead guilty to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.042" offset="753838">Under those circumstances, the dilemma that the state faces is either that they are essentially conceding that their agents denied a trial, that there was a plea agreement, committed perjury, or if it was somebody other than those agents who entered into the plea agreement, serious questions of immunity are raised, because obviously if there was an agreement in Georgia, it would contain, at least implicitly, statements about immunity, and if that is the case, one of the issues that this Court would face should it apply the dual sovereignty doctrine to successive state prosecutions is how to work out those kinds of questions of immunity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="216.843" offset="1009107">I think it is quite clear, Your Honor, for reasons I am going to develop in detail, that we have to respect territoriality in the criminal justice process, and that under those circumstances, the murder occurred in the one state, the kidnapping and the rape occurred in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.492" offset="1059680">Now, if one of those acts is not an element of an offense, and is relevant somehow to the sentencing process, then it strikes me that the territoriality principle would not restrict the state from considering that element in its decision to reach a conclusion of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.501" offset="1123732">The interesting fact in this case is that the sentencing criteria in this case is the kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.256" offset="1142749">The sine qua non is the murder, and that occurred in Georgia, not in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.730" offset="1160617">Now, this Court asked the parties to address the applicability of the dual sovereignty doctrine to successive state prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.037" offset="1265838">Now, I would like to address my remarks to three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.258" offset="1282766">First of all, the concerns of the double jeopardy clause are more acute here than in any other situation where this Court has dealt with the dual sovereignty doctrine, the concerns of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.033" offset="1317770">Commensurately, the concerns of the state are less.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.164" offset="1326338">Secondly, that a decision in favor of Alabama will have a significant impact on the administration of criminal justice in the United States, and further will call into question--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="304.322" stopTime="311.495">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="304.322" offset="1358939">Mr. Allen, let me interrupt you again.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.751" offset="1364686">Suppose the Alabama charge has been for only kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.465" offset="1383494">Would you be here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_j_allen" startTime="311.495" stopTime="588.328">
            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="311.495" offset="1387673">--No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.346" offset="1391121">And further, as I was saying, would call into question... a decision in favor of Alabama would call into question precedents of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.121" offset="1426126">The third point that I will make today is that by contrast a decision for Mr. Heath would essentially cast doubt on no precedents of this Court and maintain the status quo in the administration of criminal justice in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.618" offset="1468130">The reason the defendant's interests are more acute here than in other circumstances where this Court has dealt with the dual sovereignty exception is, first of all, here we have what is probably the pristine problem of the double jeopardy clause, apparently repeated efforts to deprive a person of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.988" offset="1537616">In most instances where the dual sovereignty exception has been applied, that is not the case, and of course that raises an increased risk of an erroneous death sentence that has not been dealt with before by this Court, but more importantly than that, a second reason why the defendant's interests are more acute here is that the state purports to ask you to extend the dual sovereignty exception to successive state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.217" offset="1638553">But that is not what they are asking you to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.966" offset="1645554">What they are asking you to do is in fact create a multiple sovereignty exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.679" offset="1660392">Under the state's argument, the fact that there are only two states involved in this case is a complete fortuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.715" offset="1688499">If states are allowed to be freed from the constraints of double jeopardy clause when a sister state has taken cognizance of that exact same act, the result could be that an individual could be tried for the same offense across a multitude of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.692" offset="1740431">A perfect example is, if a person is kidnapped, to pick up some of the examples already used today and carry it across three different jurisdictions, each of those jurisdictions would have jurisdiction over the kidnapping, and presumably if there is a murder that follows, to try that individual for the capital offense of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.415" offset="1807304">So, we are talking here not about a dual sovereignty exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.637" offset="1820261">We are talking about creating a multiple sovereignty exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.569" offset="1831964">Moreover, the interests of the state in this situation are much less than they are in the other context where this Court has extended the dual sovereignty exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.954" offset="1865505">It is conceivable the next 15 minutes of my life may be made uncomfortable by pointed questions that implicitly ask if the states are sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.251" offset="1910645">Well, let me say at the outset that yes, indeed, the states are sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.653" offset="1928304">I am not here to attack the sovereignty of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.826" offset="1936976">But to say that they are sovereign is not to say what the attributes of sovereignty are.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.897" offset="1953277">And as this Court held... or discussed, did not hold, in Garcia last year, one has to look at the interest underlying institutional relationships in interpreting the nature of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.784" offset="1988803">And I would suggest that that is an appropriate way to proceed as this Court has proceeded in the past in interpretations of the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.357" offset="2023076">If you look at your decisions, it is interesting to note that when four conditions have been met, you have applied the dual sovereignty exceptions to successive prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.075" offset="2061946">Number One, concurrent territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.937" offset="2073440">Number Two, by quite different entities, governmental entities that pursue quite different interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.961" offset="2097577">Number Three, where there is a risk of intergovernmental conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.225" offset="2114609">And Four, where the most felicitous resolution of that conflict is to allow two, not a multitude, but two prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.949" offset="2145433">None of these matters are present here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.502" offset="2159644">There obviously is not, at least I think there is not concurrent territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.505" offset="2175735">Without that, there is not the overlapping of complex statutory structures that exist, say, in the federal-state relationships, and with that overlapping of the federal and state statutes comes the possibility of continuous and annoying friction.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.996" offset="2237698">That doesn't exist in the relationship of states to each other as it does in successive federal state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.041" offset="2269881">Moreover, in the context of resolving this problem in the federal-state context, consider the alternatives that this Court faced when asked to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.646" offset="2312304">If you allow, as you could have done, the first prosecution to preempt the second, under those circumstances, a state prosecution would preempt a subsequent federal prosecution with the resultant loss of federal supremacy, obviously not a desired result.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.027" offset="2373744">The reverse, though, is no more desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.328" offset="2383043">If it is a federal prosecution that preempts a state prosecution, the result of that is federal preemption of local law enforcement, again, not desirable, but again, neither one would occur in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.894" offset="2421286">In fact, if there is any loss of sovereignty in this case, it would come by affirming Alabama's taking of jurisdiction over these events that occurred within the territorial jurisdiction in Georgia, and allowing them to execute a person for a murder that occurred within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.314" offset="2478965">Now, another--</text>

            <text syncTime="603.679" offset="2556392">The difficulty is, it was not raised by counsel for Mr. Heath below.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.461" offset="2571543">I think that nonetheless it is before this Court for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.774" offset="2584813">Your cases have always said that the dual sovereignty exception applies only when both jurisdictions have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.130" offset="2622220">Therefore your cases make an element of the dual sovereignty exception the presence of jurisdiction over the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.414" offset="2643327">That is the reason if it is before you it is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.655" offset="2656284">Now, let me also say, though, that even if you decide jurisdiction is not appropriately before you, the consequences of this Court finding the dual sovereignty exception to apply to successive state prosecution in terms of what that implies about state jurisdiction obviously is a concern that this Court should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.815" offset="4952970">Now, if I may go on with the implications of a decision in favor of Alabama, not only is there the multiple sovereignty problem, there is also going to be an impact on plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.901" offset="4993303">The only reason why a defendant pleads is to get assurances on sentence, and the more that that person is exposed to multiple prosecutions, the less likely that person is going to be to cooperate, or at least it is true the more difficult those negotiations are going to become.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.401" offset="5055265">This case is a perfect example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.524" offset="5063833">If the state is correct in its implications that there was... well, if the brief is correct, if respondent's brief is correct in its implications that there was a deal, this statement that was given, which is virtually the only evidence that ties him to the offense obviously was given in response to that deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.698" offset="5152441">Now, it is highly, highly unlikely that that individual is going to give that statement that then was used against him in Alabama if he is exposed to the prosecution in Alabama that actually occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.184" offset="5198416">So again I think one thing that you ought to think about or might want to think about is the impact of exposing an individual to multiple trials on plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.399" offset="5231330">Moreover, a decision in favor of Alabama raises serious questions for this Court, or will raise serious questions for this Court in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.854" offset="5265081">How do the vindictiveness cases apply, or will the apply to successive activities by state prosecutors in different states?</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.779" offset="5288800">The state suggests that our suggestion in our brief that in part the Alabama prosecution was a function of Mr. Heath's refusing to testify in Georgia is preposterous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.880" offset="5345224">I would like to review just quickly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.551" offset="5355882">He was called to testify against his confederates, who he identified, by the way, in the statement made to the police in Georgia, and he pled the Fifth Amendment on the grounds that he was still subject to a kidnapping charge in Alabama, which he was, and it was clearly a legitimate exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.970" offset="5413561">One week to the day after he pled the Fifth Amendment, Alabama empaneled a grand jury and indicted him for not the kidnapping but the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.696" offset="5448460">Now, it strikes me that under the precedents of this Court, Figpen versus Roberts, Blackledge versus Perry, and the like, that would clearly raise a presumption of vindictiveness, and the issue that you will face if you apply the dual sovereignty exception to successive state prosecutions is precisely that kind of an issue that will now come back to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.498" offset="5535709">How does immunity work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.030" offset="5541770">I mentioned before that we have here a problem of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.112" offset="5554099">If there was a deal, that deal implicitly contains an agreement not to prosecute for other offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.025" offset="5573744">Under your precedence, the state, if a state grants immunity, at least use and derivative use, that binds the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.860" offset="5601120">If you apply the successive state to... the dual sovereignty exception to successive state prosecutions, you will have the same kind of immunity problems in successive state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.097" offset="5638109">At least it will have to be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.378" offset="5647200">Moreover, if you allow successive state prosecutions, you will eventually have to decide the scope of state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.424" offset="5691399">You will get cases with less and less of a nexus to states, and you will have to work that problem out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.969" offset="5717521">Now, perhaps you can work it out by an easy reference to Pennoyer versus Neff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.282" offset="5730792">It is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.233" offset="5734658">I suggest that that is quite inconsistent with our understanding of criminal jurisdiction in the United States in which the single most important element is territoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.537" offset="5771856">If you affirm this opinion, affirm this case in a way that implies that criminal jurisdiction is freed from territoriality as a primary determinant, you will then have to fill the void with something else, and this Court will be the court, or the lower federal courts will be the courts that will have to answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.440" offset="5839461">I would also point out that this case is unprecedented in certain other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.762" offset="5856702">As I have said before, this is the first case that I can find, and the state has not cited any either, where there has been an extraterritorial assertion of jurisdiction over a murder that occurred somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.028" offset="5901841">There have been two cases that have reached courts of last resort where there are multiple prosecutions and a federal-state dual sovereignty exception for the same prosecution, and in both cases the courts of last resort reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.029" offset="5957848">That was the Gay case in Michigan and your case in Coleman versus Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.951" offset="5969446">I have found one case since the time we wrote our brief where multiple prosecutions for the same murder have been upheld, and that is Delay versus the United States, 602 Fed 2nd 173 of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.770" offset="6020751">Its singularity, though, I think, speaks volumes about the view of the scope of criminal jurisdiction in the United States as well as the abhorrence that we have for multiple prosecutions for the same--</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.518" offset="6555739">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.889" offset="6557201">This Court, as you know, has carved out capital sentences as a thing apart in many instances, Estelle versus Smith and all the... and you could do that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.022" offset="6585727">I have just pointed out how limited the decision could be in favor of Mr. Heath, and indeed there is a reason to do that, and that is that again the Fifth Amendment speaks specifically about putting somebody in jeopardy for their life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.149" offset="6626269">Secondly, a decision in favor of Mr. Heath overrules and casts into doubt no cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.132" offset="6646227">Thirdly, it preserves rather than disrupts the status quo in the administration of criminal justice in the United States, and no disruptive questions that I can see will come from a decision in favor of Mr. Heath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.390" offset="6695233">So, in conclusion, what I would say is that Alabama is attempting essentially to circumvent two fundamental limits on state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.435" offset="6719474">One is that we normally subject a person to a single trial for single offense, and of course the other is that the reach of the state's penal law is normally limited to territoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.113" offset="6766181">They have offered no good reason why they should be allowed to escape these limits on their power, and I would respectfully suggest that they have not been able to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.120" offset="7106191">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, despite petitioner's argument, this is a straightforward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.171" offset="7130328">There is only one issue here, and that is whether where one act violates the law of two different governments or two different sovereign governments, there are two different offenses, or whether double jeopardy... excuse me, whether the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to an act which violates the law of two different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.015" offset="7205770">As petitioner conceded, the issue of jurisdiction was not raised in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.769" offset="7228757">It was not addressed by the Alabama courts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.701" offset="7244535">It was raised in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.283" offset="7254775">This Court denied certiorari as to that issue and granted certiorari as to an issue which specifically assumed the existence of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.607" offset="7288108">Now, this Court's dual sovereignty doctrine as it has been established is very clear and very logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.992" offset="7313603">Where one act violates the law of two different sovereign governments, there are two different offenses for purposes of the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.597" offset="7340039">Two government are sovereign in relation to one another where each derives its authority to prosecute from a different source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.403" offset="7375252">This Court in United States versus Lanza and in Abbate versus United States has held that states derive their authority to prosecute from their own constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.109" offset="7418093">Now, here we have Alabama and Georgia, two states each deriving their authority to prosecute from their own constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.443" offset="7443484">These are sovereigns under the dual sovereignty doctrine, and therefore there is no double jeopardy violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.137" offset="7466263">Furthermore, this is not only clear, it makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.049" offset="7485907">In this Court's other double jeopardy cases, the focus has been on the legal distinction between the statutes, whether these statutes are legally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.205" offset="7514537">For instance, under Blockburger, the question there is whether each statute includes an element of proof which is not included in the other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.672" offset="7552362">Now, here we have two laws which are legally distinct in the most basic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.824" offset="7568976">One is an Alabama law passed by the Alabama legislature pursuant to the Alabama constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.827" offset="7593009">The other is a Georgia law passed by the Georgia legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.718" offset="7604607">They must be considered different offenses for purposes of the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.302" offset="7622893">Now, the petitioner would have the Court discard all the clear language of these cases and instead decide this case based on other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.308" offset="7662913">I would like to discuss these individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.620" offset="7676183">First is the idea of comparison of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.674" offset="7692379">Petitioner says that two prosecutions should only be allowed where the two governments are pursuing different interests, and where one government's interests are not served by another government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.349" offset="7731040">This should be rejected for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.943" offset="7741489">First, it is totally contrary to what the court has already said in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.724" offset="7760610">The focus in all the dual sovereignty cases is on sovereignty, and the focal question is, are the governments sovereign in relation to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.269" offset="7790808">It is very telling, I think, that the petitioner sites no cases which interpret this Court's cases as involving any kind of comparison of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.285" offset="7826857">Furthermore, in Abbate, Abbate versus United States, this Court was presented with a similar interest argument, and it rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.923" offset="7869384">I think the petitioner's argument is in essence that the Court simply didn't mean what it was saying in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.566" offset="7887984">Furthermore, if the Court... if the idea of interest and a comparison of interest had been the real reason for deciding these cases, United States versus Lanza would have been decided differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.295" offset="7942841">There, the petitioner... excuse me, the defendant was prosecuted in state court for manufacturing, transporting, and possessing liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.031" offset="7977845">He pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.291" offset="7982860">He was then indicted in Federal court for manufacturing, possessing, and transporting exactly the same liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.946" offset="8009505">So therefore the interests in this case were identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.518" offset="8027791">The second reason for rejecting this comparison of interest test is a related one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.635" offset="8052241">Because this comparison of interest is contrary to the settled law in this area, the Court could not adopt it in the area of prosecution by two different states without casting serious doubts on its holdings in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.321" offset="8102919">The third reason for rejecting this comparison of interest test is a more practical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.784" offset="8124862">If this test were adopted, the Court would be discarding a very clear and a very sound doctrine in favor of one that has to be fleshed out on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.459" offset="8159553">Now, in our brief, I have demonstrated the difficulty in applying... that often arises in applying a test like this to prosecutions by two different states, and the petitioner in his reply brief has essentially admitted that that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.109" offset="8210126">Furthermore, if a comparison of interest test were adopted and applied in this case, they are different interests here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.394" offset="8247219">The petitioner pled guilty, and he received in Georgia for his Georgia offense a life sentence with parole eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.690" offset="8280447">However, under Alabama law the punishment is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.543" offset="8295807">Under Alabama law the minimum punishment is life imprisonment without parole, and the prosecutor in this case asked for the death penalty given the nature of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.479" offset="8331647">So, Alabama has unsatisfied interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.570" offset="8340006">The second factor in the petitioner's test is the idea of concurrent territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.366" offset="8375115">He points out that in all these dual sovereignty cases courts happen to have been exercising current territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.400" offset="8399252">This is simply a different... a distinction without being a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.022" offset="8413776">The focus of the dual sovereignty... the essence of the dual sovereignty doctrine is that where one act violates the law of two sovereign governments, there are two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.127" offset="8446168">Now, how those governments happen to have obtained jurisdiction, whether it is because there is concurrent territorial jurisdiction or because, as here, a defendant commits in essence the continuing criminal transaction across the line of two different states, is simply irrelevant to that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.597" offset="8508026">Now, the third factor in the petitioner's proposed test is the idea of intergovernmental conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.764" offset="8544702">He says that two prosecutions should only be allowed where there is a substantial possibility of intergovernmental conflict in barring the second prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.928" offset="8577407">Again, like the other two factors, this is contrary to the explicit language of all the dual sovereignty cases, and the petitioner cites no case which interprets those cases as involving that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.655" offset="8620353">Moreover, there is easily as great a possibility of intergovernmental conflict in the area of prosecutions among the 50 states as in the area of prosecutions by the federal government and Indian tribes, and this Court has already held in United States versus Wheeler that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.848" offset="8693077">The fact that these factors that the petitioner cites were not the basis of the Court's decisions as shown by the case of Waller versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.844" offset="8737068">In that case we had different interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.615" offset="8748144">The person was prosecuted in municipal court for misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.649" offset="8764235">He was then prosecuted in state court for a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.411" offset="8775311">So there was a difference in the punishment, a significant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.552" offset="8783879">There was concurrent territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.464" offset="8795582">Furthermore, there is a substantial risk of intergovernmental conflict and prosecutions involving municipalities and states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.591" offset="10064088">--Yes, I did, but let me clarify what I meant if I didn't say it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.183" offset="10082374">Alabama basically has two interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.246" offset="10090628">Alabama has declared that when a person is kidnapped from Alabama and murdered, that is a capital offense in Alabama, regardless of whether that violates the law of another state or whether another state prosecutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.522" offset="10131797">We have an interest in seeing that a person is prosecuted and sentenced according to Alabama law for that Alabama offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.738" offset="10160637">Now, if you want to simply boil the case down to a matter of interest, and if you can assume that the punishment or the proceedings in another state can satisfy Alabama's interest under its law, then Alabama does have an unsatisfied interest in this particular case, because the minimum punishment, the punishment he received in Georgia is less than what he... the minimum punishment he would have received in Alabama, and a prosecutor certainly could take that into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.828" offset="10288950">One other factor I would like to clear up, Mr. Allen has asserted that the record is not clear that Mr. Heath pled guilty in exchange for a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.486" offset="10343598">I am not really sure I understand his argument with regard to that, but Mr. Heath himself testified, I believe, that he pled guilty in Georgia in exchange for a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.752" offset="10496676">So, Your Honor, Alabama in exercising its discretion to prosecute certainly could take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.965" offset="10521544">As to... this is not an important point, but I would like to assert the record is not clear where the murder in this case took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.282" offset="10558847">What we know about this case is that this woman was forcibly abducted from Alabama and that her body was later found in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.358" offset="10587164">As to when... now, the record probably suggests that she died in Georgia, but as to where she was shot, we simply don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.714" offset="10624571">As to the assertion that the petitioner was prosecuted because he took the Fifth Amendment in Georgia or asserted his Fifth Amendment rights, there is nothing in the record to suggest that other than the coincidence of dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.760" offset="10676712">It is pretty clear what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.262" offset="10682772">This man was charge in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.522" offset="10687788">Alabama simply sat back and let Georgia proceed against them until Georgia was through with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.767" offset="10712761">There were a number of trials taking place in his co-defendants around this time, and it was simply convenient for Alabama to wait until Georgia was through with Mr. Heath for whatever purposes before they tried to extradite him back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.736" offset="10768663">Now, with regard to the case of Nielson versus Oregon, what that is, in that case there is some dicta which suggest that when one state, when two states have concurrent jurisdiction over an area, and where one state proceeds against a defendant for violation of its laws, where the other state also prohibits that laws, it then loses its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.222" offset="10866570">Now, to the extent that that is good law still, that holding or that dicta only relates to the issue of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.747" offset="11020692">On your view of the double jeopardy clause, could your state go ahead and prosecute him again for the same offense and impose an additional ten years so he would get a total of 20?</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.632" offset="11284215">Now, I have a number of points to make if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.353" offset="11295082">With respect to the analogy to civil jurisdiction, I would like to point out that there are substantial differences between civil and criminal law jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.467" offset="11319533">For example, full faith and credit, collateral estoppel, res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.158" offset="11338341">If you were to accept an analogy to civil jurisdiction, presumably you would accept an analogy to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.163" offset="11358299">If that is true, then this case in Georgia would be res judicata in Alabama, and thus be... we wouldn't be here today because it wouldn't have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.087" offset="11385988">The respondent says there are no cases discussing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.541" offset="11403856">We discussed these cases, and I will not read from the quotes on Page 30 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.001" offset="11417649">It is quite clear that one of the important issues that this Court has faced has been the interest underlying the institutional relationships when it has decided the scope of the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.268" offset="11454743">Alabama also asserts that even applying my test, the test that I suggest, you ought to come out for them here because there would be intergovernmental conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.265" offset="11494762">I don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.576" offset="11503957">If you had a situation, say, where Georgia wished to prosecute somebody to preempt Alabama from doing so and wouldn't cooperate, I take it they don't have to extradite them either, so that extending the dual sovereignty doctrine to resolve that conflict doesn't resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.677" offset="11564353">Now, Georgia could just keep custody of the person and not let Alabama discharge their law no matter what you do about the dual sovereignty exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.631" offset="11588176">I would also like to point out, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to some of your questions that every time you have two prosecutions, the second prosecuting authority wants to raise the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.998" offset="11633629">It is the only reason to prosecute.</text>
