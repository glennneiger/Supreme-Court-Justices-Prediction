            <text syncTime="17.243" offset="215868">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.567" offset="253171">This case involves the proper time for claiming deductions by taxpayers that use the accrual basis of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.074" offset="291101">Under this Court's decision, the proper time for accruing tax deductions is governed by the 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.144" offset="343450">As the Court noted 50 years ago, in Brown versus Helvering and more recently in Thor Power Tool Company in 1979, the all events test helps to serve the objectives of tax accounting.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="63.532" offset="401024">Well, Mr. Lauber, you refer to the Court enunciating a principle, and it was just a sentence in Justice Stone's opinion, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="72.809" stopTime="235.977">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="72.809" offset="438118">Well, that's all it began its life as, but it has since taken on a kind of talismanic quality in tax jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.503" offset="468838">It's one of the great traditional tests that has come down to us through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.547" offset="485034">And, the meaning of the test is what governs the time of taking accrued deductions by taxpayers, previous accrual, accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.963" offset="526725">I don't think Justice Stone intended it to have that quality, but it has been seized upon and elaborated by the Court itself in later years.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.148" offset="555460">And the way the all events test helps to serve the objectives of tax accounting is to protect the fisc and to help achieve equality of treatment for taxpayers by insisting upon a high degree of certainty before deductions are permitted for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.461" offset="628707">The all events test has two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.205" offset="639679">It requires that an item of expense be taken as a tax deduction, be accrued for the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that create on the part of the taxpayer a fixed and unconditional obligation to pay the expense, and secondly, which permit the amount of that payment to be determined with reasonable accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.541" offset="737063">This case involves the proper application of the first component of the test, that is, the requirement that the taxpayer have at the end of the year a fixed obligation to make a payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.836" offset="782203">The taxpayer here is a Nevada gambling casino that operates, on the casino floor, gambling devices called progressive slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.415" offset="824521">A progressive slot machine is like an ordinary slot machine except that it has, besides its usual jackpot, an additional progressive jackpot whose amount is shown on a little meter on the face of the machine, and every time somebody plays the machine and loses, the meter goes up and it keeps on going up until somebody actually wins the jackpot.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.679" offset="917517">In order to win a jackpot the player must gamble the required amount of money, which is the case of a multiple coin machine is the maximum amount that can be gambled.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.427" offset="964538">And, he must pull the handle and come up with the winning combination of symbols.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.771" offset="981987">The odds of winning a progressive jackpot are determined by the casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.144" offset="1003408">By adjusting the number of wheels on the machine, the number of symbols on each wheel, the number of winning symbols, the casino can determine the odds of winning the jackpot, and based on the expected frequency of the machine's play, it can predict a projected payoff date of any particular progressive jackpot.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.305" offset="1132035">My understanding is that the regular jackpots tend to be in smaller amounts and are won much more frequently, and I don't believe the Nevada Gaming Commission regulates regular jackpots, only progressive jackpots.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.983" offset="1186787">So, respondents don't have the argument available to them here, that the Commission's regulations give them a fixed liability--</text>

            <text syncTime="274.134" offset="1243421">The projected payoff date for these jackpots can range from several months down the road to several years down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.518" offset="1276962">The money corresponding to the jackpots does not sit physically in the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.361" offset="1296293">The casinos typically collect the coins out of the machine a couple of times a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.415" offset="1320534">They are free to use that money and to earn income upon it, as they see fit, until a jackpot is actually won.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.140" offset="1347388">When a jackpot is won, the winner typically will go and seek payment from the cashier's cage at the casino.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.866" offset="1514363">It comes over from a human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.340" offset="1524185">There is no dispute here that progressive jackpots intrinsically are the kind of expense that qualify for deduction as a proper expense of running a gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.075" offset="1567130">The only question here concerns the proper time for taking the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.319" offset="1584162">And the question is really one of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.191" offset="1595656">It is an important question because of the time value of money, both from government and the taxpayers' point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.673" offset="1621569">We contend that the proper year for conducting a progressive jackpot is a year in which the jackpot is actually won by the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.469" offset="1656678">Respondent argues that the actual winning of the jackpot is irrelevant, and that its liability for the jackpots becomes established the minute the machine is placed on the gambling floor to begin with.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.778" offset="1709968">Mr. Lauber, how does the Internal Revenue Service treat funds that are set aside by insurance companies out of premiums to pay off potential expected claims, and is there some correlation between the rules for that and the rules applicable here?</text>

          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="411.903" stopTime="466.878">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="411.903" offset="1794500">Well, there is a lot to say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.266" offset="1807875">The Revenue Code treats insurance companies in a unique manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.519" offset="1828877">There's a whole subchapter of the Code, Subchapter L, that just governs insurance companies, and Congress allows insurance companies alone of all taxpayers to claim current deductions for additions to reserves they establish to pay off life insurance and disability claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.429" offset="1896587">So, they are allowed to deduct these reserves anticipatorily through a particular congressional statute that covers just insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.565" offset="1933158">Ordinary taxpayers may equally be motivated to establish reserves on their books, but they can't deduct them because they're not allowed to by the Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.311" offset="1976103">There are some reserves, like bad debt reserves, that Congress has authorized, but generally speaking reserves are reserved for life insurance companies and casualty insurance companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.878" offset="2014347">Is there any other broad category of business deductions that would potentially be affected by a decision here on the application of the all events test?</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="480.656" offset="2069517">Well, that could depend on how the decision was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.740" offset="2081847">This is an issue, as I mentioned to Justice Rehnquist, that's been around for a great number of years and there have been an awful lot of Court of Appeals cases that have construed the all events test as applied to accruals for Workmen's Compensation liabilities, tort claims, all kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.731" offset="2153736">And the principle of what your need to have in fixed obligations to make a payment is very important in the tax law generally, and all these other obligations could be affected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.740" offset="2197831">Now, Congress has amended the tax laws in 1984 to take care of some of those problems, Workmen's Compensation and the like, but generally speaking the old events test remains the basic judicial test that Congress has modified in some ways the years after '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.862" offset="2270347">So, the Court's decision would affect virtually all deductions claimed by accrual basis taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.515" offset="2296887">Respondents' argument is that they should be allowed to accrue as a deduction for any year the net increase in the amounts shown on those jackpot meters for the year, as of midnight on the last day of their tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.759" offset="2373896">That argument is based on the theory that it's very likely that somebody will eventually win the jackpot due to the laws of averages, and that when somebody does win the jackpot the amount they win will be at least as big as the amount on the year-end meter because Nevada regulations prohibit casinos from turning these meters back down to a lesser amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.943" offset="2474624">In analyzing this case we start from the premise that the type of liability presupposed by the all events test is not some kind of inchoate or abstract liability, but the obligation to make a payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.406" offset="2540453">This is what distinguishes the accrual method of accounting from the cash method.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.329" offset="2564172">Under the cash method an item is deductible when the taxpayer actually says the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.072" offset="2591130">Under the accrual method, it is deductible when he incurs the obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.837" offset="2610252">Let me ask just one other preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.138" offset="2619447">Would you not agree, and I know you would suggest it's not dispositive, but that sound accounting practices normally, for example, for disclosure for SEC purposes and the like would require setting up reserves for this kind of contingent liability?</text>

            <text syncTime="634.679" offset="2685589">In fact the accountants for the respondent required that a reserve be set up for these contingent liabilities at the end of the year, and they found that was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, but this Court has often held, most recently in Thor Power Tool Company, and earlier in Triple-A, that the fact that a deduction, an accrual is proper for financial accounting purposes, is not dispositive for tax purposes because of very different objectives that the two accounting systems have.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.559" offset="2809096">In this case we think it is clear that respondent at the close of its tax year had incurred no obligation to pay the progressive jackpots to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.448" offset="2860609">Indeed, there is no one in the world who could at that moment assert any possible claim to those funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.749" offset="5161893">Which means, if it ever does incur the liability, it will be in at least that minimum amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.462" offset="5184672">That rule does not affect the contingent nature of the pre-existing obligation the casino had to pay the jackpot if and only if somebody wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.297" offset="5224064">We think a good way of analyzing these progressive jackpots is that they are prizes offered to the public to induce people to gamble on the slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.586" offset="5277249">The Gaming Commission's rules basically require the casino to keep that offer open indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.554" offset="5317060">It required that it make an irrevocable offer of a prize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.876" offset="5334405">But, they don't require the casino to actually pay the prize until somebody wins it, so while the casino has an irrevocable offer, that offer is still... its liability on the offer is still contingent until some lucky patron in effect accepts the offer by satisfying the preconditions for payment, which is to gamble a required amount of money and to come up with the winning combination of symbols on the slot machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.153" offset="5439418">It has to be both the offer and the acceptance of the offer before you have an obligation to make a payment, and that's what the tax law requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.770" offset="5477974">We think it would be quite a different case if the Nevada gaming authorities required a casino to pay an amount corresponding to the year-end jackpot totals to an escrow agent, or to a trustee, to be held for the benefit of future jackpot winners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.892" offset="5558432">In that event it would be an obligation to make a payment to an independent party who would hold the money for the beneficiaries, ultimate winners of the jackpots, with the money never being able to revert back to the casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.470" offset="5612766">It would also be very different if respondent, to insure its obligations on the jackpots, were to pay... take out insurance policies covering its contingent liability on the jackpots and paid a premium to an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.060" offset="5675042">They could deduct that premium.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.063" offset="7399124">There is one additional requirement which is necessary in order for us to accrue the deduction which we seek to accrue in this case, and that is that, quite apart from the all events test, the accrual must result in a clear reflection of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.186" offset="7471640">That relates, we believe, to some of the questions that were, asked about the period of time between the accrual and the payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.023" offset="7502987">The record of the case indicates that that period of time was four and a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.794" offset="7518033">We're saying this because there are other cases, generally from the lower courts, in which the period of time between the accrual and the payoff could be perhaps as much as 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.581" offset="7565158">Those cases, we suggest, don't deal with the notion of the all events test, which is what we are talking about here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.635" offset="9685361">We say that's not so, because the all events test doesn't require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.519" offset="9700929">The government is really trying to add to the existing all events test the notion that the obligation must be payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.862" offset="9730291">Now, in U.S. v. Anderson, the first case, the obligation there was not payable at the time the accrual was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.409" offset="9768534">This was an excise tax case on munitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.233" offset="9787761">The taxpayer sought to deduct the excise tax in the year following the manufacture and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.169" offset="9827571">In 1916 the munitions were manufactured and sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.903" offset="9846484">The tax was not due until it was assessed the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.436" offset="9868636">The taxpayer took the position that the government is taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.648" offset="9881488">It said, wait, until this is payable by the assessment, the tax is not going... cannot be accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.293" offset="9911999">The tax is not yet due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.925" offset="9918582">The government took the position in Anderson that we're taking here, and said the liability exists at the and of the manufacturing and sale, similar to the end of our tax year here by the operation of the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.915" offset="9978559">Because at that point, all events necessary to fix the liability had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.618" offset="9997367">The government is trying to turn that around and say in our situation, we must impose on the all events test the additional requirement of payability, and that that payability would exist at the time a customer pulls the winning handle of the slot machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.559" offset="10061106">So, we say that we are on all fours with the Anderson case, and that to adopt the government's position would really reconstruct Anderson in a different way than it's existed on the books since 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.579" offset="10121187">As to the question of how other... so-called regular slot machines are treated, let me see if I can illustrate our liability argument in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.464" offset="10160685">The only reason we say we're able to accrue the liability for the progressive slot machines is because of the existence of the Nevada regulation, statutes and policies which are discussed in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.045" offset="10218990">Those pertain only to the progressive slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.997" offset="10230797">We also have summary judgment evidence in the form of affidavits that the reason for the existence of those regulations is that because the jackpot amount increases with each play on all the casino customers, that the Commission views that as being an investment, if you will, by the players in the jackpot amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.811" offset="10314076">Regular slot machines don't have any such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.325" offset="10332152">We would say, as to the regular slot machines, we're not entitled to and we do not accrue those liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.200" offset="10359633">Those could be taken off the floor at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.002" offset="10370814">Those could be removed, and any jackpots on regular nonprogressive machines could be taken off at any time, but we're not permitted under the regulations to remove the progressive slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.739" offset="10417834">Once they're on the casino floor and are put into play, they must stay there until they're won.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.515" offset="10444897">Now, in this case we're not trying to anticipate and to accrue as an expense the amount of the eventual payout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.568" offset="10477080">We are simply taxing the amount which exists or the machine at the end of our fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.832" offset="10498187">The winning of the jackpot is the equivalent, we believe, of the assessment of the tax in Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.411" offset="10548446">The winning of a jackpot doesn't fix the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.643" offset="10565374">It does identify a payee, but the record... and our briefs are replete with cases which indicate that you don't really have to be able to identify a payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.490" offset="10604766">We know that there will be a payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.890" offset="10610409">We don't have to identify that payee by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.752" offset="10621903">The economic and the practical effect of the regulation is that we're going to have to pay that jackpot, and in fact the record indicates that we did pay all of these progressive jackpots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.141" offset="10675401">What the government is trying to do, we believe, is to impose some of the requirements which were established in the 1984 legislation, which is the referred to as the Tax Reform Act of 1984 on the one hand, or the Tax Deficit Act of 1984 on the other, which established in addition to the existing law and regulations on the all events, test, it established a principle of economic performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.118" offset="10787310">We believe the government is trying to... is asking this Court to judicially legislate in this case a principle that is the practical equivalent of the economic performance of the 1984 legislation which is applicable only to deductions that occur after July of 1984.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.720" offset="11405785">The affidavit of Mr. Griffith in the Joint Appendix indicates that they count the jackpots twice a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.155" offset="11439431">They have to file reports with the Gaming Commission, I believe weekly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.637" offset="11453432">It's very highly regulated, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.170" offset="11463568">One, of course, in any industry where there's a lot of cash exchanging hands, it's to everyone's benefit to have it highly regulated.</text>
