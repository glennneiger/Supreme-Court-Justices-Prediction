            <label>Mr. Frank C. Woodside, III</label>
            <text syncTime="77.601" offset="438629">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in order to understand the pendent and federal question jurisdictional issues involved in this matter, it is first necessary to briefly understand the history of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.909" offset="487843">Bendectin was a medicine manufactured by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in the United States which was for the treatment of morning sickness in pregnant women.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.406" offset="533819">There are several counterparts.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.118" offset="540715">There is Canadian bendectin.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.288" offset="545417">There was Debendox, which is an equivalent product manufactured in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.612" offset="562658">In this particular instance the petitioners are Scottish and Canadian individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.115" offset="584705">The litigation involving the American claims was originally consolidated pursuant to multi-district rules before the Honorable Carl Ruben in Cincinnati, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.302" offset="621486">At approximately the same time there were a series of cases filed by foreign plaintiffs which had originally been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.789" offset="659416">Those cases were transferred to 1404 transfer, Judge Briotz to Judge Ruben, after the cases had been... after the foreign cases had been transferred to the Southern District of Ohio, a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens was renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.801" offset="723468">That motion was granted and subsequently approved by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a case called Ballen versus Richardson Merrell, Inc. Richardson Merrell, Inc., is a predecessor corporation to Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, and for all intents and purposes they are the same company.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.491" offset="786162">After Judge Ruben had dismissed the foreign cases... there were a series of approximately 12 on a forum non conveniens basis... the instant cases were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.229" offset="837153">And they were filed in state court on September 1st, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.943" offset="856065">As I have indicated previously, one of the plaintiffs is from Scotland, took Debendox, the other plaintiff was from Canada and took Canadian Bendectin.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.828" offset="895563">In the complaints which these two plaintiffs filed, and by the way they are virtually identical and were filed by the same counsel, there are six causes of action asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.225" offset="937150">In these complaints there is implication that the drug which was used was the American version of Bendectin, and the American defendant, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the American company was the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.384" offset="985737">The fourth cause of action states that the petitioner in the instant action is liable for violations of a breach of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and that as a result it is presumptively negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.225" offset="1049163">When those cases were filed, a removal petition was placed of record, and the cases were transferred to Judge Ruben in the Southern District of Ohio for the filing in Hamilton County, Ohio, in the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.135" offset="1108826">After they had been removed, two things happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.869" offset="1119693">One, the respondents filed a motion to remand, and the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss based upon the document and forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.313" offset="1157518">Judge Ruben ruled that the right to relief asserted by the plaintiffs in their fourth cause of action depended upon application of the laws of the United States, and he then determined there was federal question jurisdiction, therefore overruled the motion of the respondent to remand the cases and then dismissed the cases on the basis of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.609" offset="1246648">After that dismissal, the cases were then appealed by the respondents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.544" offset="1274443">The Sixth Circuit ruled that... actually, what the Sixth Circuit did is, they did not take issue... I am not saying they agreed with it... they did not take issue with Judge Ruben's determination that there was a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.694" offset="1335047">Instead what they did was, they stated that the various causes of action, of which there were six, should be considered collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.630" offset="1370782">Now, the first cause of action in these particular cases is a regular negligence cause of action which alleged that Merrell Dow was negligent in the design, manufacture, sale, and distribution of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.008" offset="1416235">The Court of Appeals ruled that since the fourth cause of action stated... strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.774" offset="1459390">The Court of Appeals ruled that the sixth... excuse me... the fourth cause of action was a negligence action, a negligence per se action in which the respondents had stated that there was negligence per se because of violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.496" offset="1526263">The Court of Appeals said that since the first cause of action was also a negligence action, that... and since the respondents could recover fully and completely for negligence on that first cause of action, that because of this parallel pleading, it was not necessary for there to be a resolution of the substantial federal... question of federal law in order for the plaintiffs below to prevail on a negligence theory, and therefore it determined that there was no federal question of jurisdiction, and reversed the decision of Judge Ruben and remanded the cases back to the state court, and then we filed the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.458" offset="1718106">Now, it is our position in this litigation that the plaintiff's right to relief under the fourth cause of action necessarily depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.486" offset="1774217">Why do we have to decide that if all the Court of Appeals held, as you have said, is that we do not need to decide anything about the fourth cause of action because of the first, because they could recover on a state cause of action?</text>

            <text syncTime="438.888" offset="1883827">In point of fact, the situation is, one way to respond would be to say that the consideration by the Court of Appeals that pleading alternative causes of action creates a situation where there is no federal jurisdiction is not in accord with the Franchise Tax Board decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.373" offset="1981734">See, what the Court of Appeals--</text>

            <text syncTime="503.980" offset="2144111">I think they probably had to to have done that, although they didn't say so in their opinion, because, Your Honor, if they hadn't done that, then it would not have been necessary to determine that there were parallel claims... for instance, if they had determined that the fourth cause of action did not state a federal claim, if they had so ruled, they would not have gotten to the basis for their decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.332" offset="2457581">See, but more importantly, I think, the federal question involved here... there are several federal questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.885" offset="2483807">In this particular situation, where faced with a set of facts wherein the drug which was allegedly ingested by the two mothers, the drug which allegedly caused the problem, was not manufactured, was not distributed, was not sold by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.016" offset="2552353">It was sold by independent subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.380" offset="2561757">While the plaintiffs below allege that the activities of companies in the United Kingdom, Scotland, and the activities of companies in Canada are subject to the regulations and the statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that, the federal question there is whether or not there is then an extraterritorial imposition on companies abroad of the safety statutes of this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.661" offset="2774916">And there was no thought in that case that there was any federal jurisdiction other than by diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.897" offset="2795814">You plead negligence and you say the want of due care, and you say violation of a state statutory standard, you say violation of a federal statutory standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.360" offset="2877734">In point of fact, we submit that there are very, very few situations in which an allegation of negligence based upon a violation of a safety statute would create federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.836" offset="2919634">What we state is that the plaintiff's right to relief must necessarily depend on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.303" offset="2953489">Now, if you take the situation you have talked about, or if you talk about the numerous decisions of trial courts and courts of appeals and even this Court to some extent, in which there are allegations in the complaint of negligence based upon violations of the Safety Appliances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.932" offset="3012003">Now, you see, the Safety Appliances Act, for instance, it usually comes up, of course, in FELA cases, it is only a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.345" offset="3037603">The statutes are simply... there is a... the law concerning them is well settled, so the question simply is, did the person violate that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.558" offset="3230492">You do not get to the question of what the court should charge the jury on because first of all you have got to determine several federal questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.628" offset="6178776">If something is substantial, that means it is not obviously without merit, or not foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent, or not made solely to obtain jurisdiction, for instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.906" offset="6407817">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe that Justices Rehnquist and Powell have put the finger on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.323" offset="6453584">There is no way to surgically excise two Bendectin cases out from the well established standard that there need to be either a private cause of action, and both sides admit that there is no private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.986" offset="6528190">As a matter of fact, the legislative history shows that that was one of the options, to give a private cause of action to FDAC, Federal Drug and Cosmetic cases, and that was deleted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.173" offset="6576986">So then the question is, is there a federal question, and while my worthy opponent would like to surgically excise two Bendectin cases, we cannot take case by case, because historically there is presently sitting a stay order on 235 American cases in which the Honorable Judge Ruben, after the Bendectin trial, took the 235 cases that could not be removed because they were residents of Ohio, Merrell Dow being a resident of Ohio, it's a 1441(b) scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.885" offset="6719824">The court took these 235 American cases and put them back to the state court, remanded them to the state court, and has withheld his order pending the determination of this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.590" offset="6918563">As a plaintiff, I would say to you that it is more than a lucky strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.442" offset="6930057">The point that I am making is that Mr. Woodside, my opponent, was talking historically, and I am indicating here that it isn't an issue of two or three foreign cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.568" offset="6970495">There is an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.451" offset="6978018">If the position is that the FDAC does not apply to Canadian cases and Scottish cases, then I think it is inappropriate to come before this bench and state categorically that it is a federal issue because there was a pleading of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.020" offset="7052310">I would agree totally with Justice Powell that it is a negligence case, and that you are talking about a standard of conduct and a violation of the FDA is at best a violation of a standard which can be introduced in evidence by experts, and is done all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.580" offset="7110511">In response to a question by Justice Rehnquist, I would say as a plaintiff's counsel there is no way but to open the floodgates of litigation, and just as an example, the following cases would then become all federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.061" offset="7180519">The Safety Appliances Act, which is more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.552" offset="7190446">Federal Civil Aeronautics Act, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, ERISA, just the simple Flammable Fabrics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.908" offset="7219912">In other words, everyone, we are very familiar with the flammable fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.960" offset="7232033">There is a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.450" offset="7238093">Therefore every flammable fabrics case which would mention whether or not there was a violation of the Act, whether it met the standard, would then be a federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.498" offset="7270276">Packers and Stockyards Act, United States Warehouse Act, Federal Meat Inspection Act, Urban Mass Transportation Act, the Ladman Trademark Act, Emission Standards Act for automobiles, and recently in the agent orange, the Second Circuit, a case I am familiar with, 635 Fed 2nd 987, held that the bend rule, it is FIFRA, which is the Federal Fungible Insecticide Act, was not an issue for federal, or a federal substantial law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.675" offset="7386991">Quite simply, I think that the Sixth Circuit addresses the issue, I think, very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.609" offset="7410710">Clearly there is agreed no private right of action by those injured by violations of the FDCA, and that, two, the plaintiff's right to relief does not depend necessarily upon a finding of a violation of the FDCA, and you could still find negligence, and this is consistent with the rulings by all other circuits and the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.854" offset="7503706">I believe circuits have already addressed, most circuits have already addressed... I know the Seventh Circuit has, and other circuits, and we indicate that on Page 13 and 14 of our brief, and I don't want to track our brief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.612" offset="7550727">I believe that at best this Court would have to take a position, because I don't believe that the Court would ever want to take the position that all of these are federal Acts... pardon me, are federal issues of law, every one of these, because that would be an impossible floodgate of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.637" offset="7642782">The next question that this Court would have to address is, does this Court want to take FDAC and make it a private cause of action, and I do not see anything in the preceding cases, whether it be franchise or more, that would lead one to believe that it is the intent of this Court to make the FDAC a private cause of action, and of course this Court can change it, can change that rule and make it a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.878" offset="7767752">I advocate that it should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.229" offset="7777156">I advocate that the state courts, whether it be Ohio or Kentucky, can clearly apply the law, and it does not take only the wisdom of a federal district court to apply the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.137" offset="7824803">Simply stated, the FDAC is a very simple statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.741" offset="7855210">Misbranding is misbranding, and the best example I can give you is that Ohio has an exact parallel statute on misbranding which is word for word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.928" offset="7891990">I would suggest or submit that not only would it open the floodgates, as we have indicated, but it would, I believe, create an impression that of course Merrell would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.621" offset="7974746">It would create an impression that any and all federal drug cases must or become dominanted by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.140" offset="8024797">I suggest that from the recent cases I have had an opportunity to review, the intention, because of the backlog of the federal judiciary, is not to encumber federal trial judges with more litigation, what with Title 7, Social Security cases, Speedy Trial Act cases, not to encumber the federal court with more cases, because I think as succinctly stated on the last page of our brief, and I would indicate that I think it is very well stated by Ms. Smith, who wrote that portion, on the point that you would have a situation whereby every time there was an allegation of a federal violation or a federal statute, then the defendants could remove it to federal court if they didn't have diversity, and likewise, every plaintiff could dress up a federal violation and make it a federal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.853" offset="9383687">On the federal... or the private cause of action issue, while we do not believe that there is a private cause of action, and Mr. Chesley apparently now also so believes, nevertheless, in the fourth and fifth causes of action of the complaint, it has asserted that there is in fact a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.830" offset="9487550">Now, I think the law is... I think this is accurate... jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the affirmance might fail to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.850" offset="9535615">What happens is, the Court has to first say, yes, we have jurisdiction, and then dismiss the private right claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.726" offset="9579187">Now, in the Griffin case about which Mr. Chesley spoke, that is, the E. Farrell case in Cincinnati, what happens is, the Court had jurisdiction and then struck those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.623" offset="9622759">In the Bendectin situation, involving the use of foreign products by foreign plaintiffs, the trial court, in this case Judge Ruben, bypassed the necessity of striking the claims and simply dismissed the actions based upon the forum non conveniens doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.388" offset="9701754">He had jurisdiction to do that because of the fact that the plaintiff's complaints in these... do in fact allege a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.002" offset="9740206">It would not ultimately withstand a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.745" offset="9755252">Nevertheless, it was not necessary for the court to do that because the court dismissed these cases based upon the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.480" offset="9854204">I mean, if we agree here there isn't any private cause of action, you are saying, even though we know what the answer is, there was jurisdiction over the whole case.</text>
