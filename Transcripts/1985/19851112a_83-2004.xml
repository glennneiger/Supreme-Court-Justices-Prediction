            <label>Mr. Donald J. Zoeller</label>
            <text syncTime="78.985" offset="458401">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.405" offset="468118">This appeal involves the circumstances under which courts may permit factfinders to infer from a mix of evidence that there has been a conspiracy in violation of the United States antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.979" offset="518378">In this case, the district court, after carefully reviewing and analyzing the mountain of evidence that had been gathered by the plaintiffs during the pretrial phase, determined that that evidence could not support a rational inference that the defendants had entered into and carried out the alleged conspiracy to establish low and predatory prices in the United States market.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.140" offset="615031">The court accordingly granted summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.249" offset="623495">The court of appeals reversed and said a trial was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.153" offset="639064">In reversing, the court of appeals made two fundamental errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.151" offset="655050">First, it failed to follow and carry out this Court's inference standards as enunciated in the case of First National City Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.100" offset="702907">As a result of that error, the court was led to authorize a factfinder to speculate that pricing conduct in the United States market, indistinguishable from the kind of vigorous pricing competition fostered by the antitrust laws and beneficial to consumers, that is low prices for the purpose of getting business, was actually not competition as it appeared to be but was conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.058" offset="810740">In reversing and finding summary judgment inappropriate, the court of appeals also held and made basic reliance on its conclusion that a factfinder could incur... infer, excuse me, that conduct by the defendants which their government ordered them and said it ordered them to enter into in furtherance of a Japanese governmental program was part of a conspiracy that violated our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.858" offset="929859">Now, these two errors not only call for reversal in this case but established a dangerous precedent that this Court should deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.074" offset="962773">First of all, they are dangerous from the standpoint of antitrust policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.417" offset="980118">Permitting an inference of conspiracy to be drawn from conduct indistinguishable from competition can chill the vigorous competition that the antitrust laws seek to foster in the interest of American consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.771" offset="1029542">Secondly, this precedent is dangerous from the standpoint of judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.237" offset="1051380">District... carving out and fashioning exceptions to this Court's inference standards in order to turn down motions for summary judgment can cause district courts to say all the monumental effort that it takes to tame and control a case of the size of this case is simply not worth it; that it will simply be frustrated by the courts above.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.228" offset="1143436">And this decision is dangerous from the standpoint of the relationship of the United States to its most valued trading partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.037" offset="1174574">I would like to deal first with the inference of conspiracy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.317" offset="1191710">Now, the court of appeals held that a factfinder could infer from the record in this case that the pricing activities of the defendants in the United States market were not individual competitive activities, but were coordinated and orchestrated pursuant to some common plan or some agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.904" offset="1266107">For such an inference to be rational, however, the record should show there should be evidence of uniform prices suggestive of conspiracy, or at the very minimum that those prices showed some discernible pattern in the United States market.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.850" offset="1333921">There is no such evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.192" offset="1347295">The plaintiffs don't even pretend there is such evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.472" offset="1360357">The most that the evidence in this case shows, such pricing evidence as there is, is that the prices by the Japanese defendants in this market were, as the district court stated, all over the lot; that they ran at every price level in the United States market from the highest price levels on down; that they were so varied that the plaintiffs could describe the allegedly conspiratorial conduct only in terms of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.603" offset="1460876">They say the Japanese defendants agreed to charge prices necessary to get the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.679" offset="1485222">So does every competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.537" offset="1492641">The court of appeals said that the jury or a factfinder could infer that these pricing activities were predatory and that they were part of an overall scheme under which supposedly high prices and profits in the Japanese market could be dumped into the United States market for the purpose of supporting low prices here; for the ultimate purpose of jointly monopolizing the United States market.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.744" offset="1601415">Now, for such an inference to be rational, the plaintiffs should be able to produce some evidence that there was a purpose to predation; that ultimately those who paid the price of predation could recover their predatory losses through monopoly profits at some foreseeable point where it made some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.034" offset="1682603">They should also have some evidence that those smaller Japanese competitors, those who had smaller shares of the United States market, had a mechanism to share the burdens and benefit of predation at the one hand and monopolization at the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.121" offset="1742998">Far from showing that, the record in this case is entirely to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.056" offset="1762747">The undisputed facts of this case are that from the beginning of the alleged period of conspiracy when these companies entered the United States market with zero market shares, on through the roughly 20 years covered by this case, the two market leaders in the United States, Zenith and RCA, remained the two market Leaders in the United States; lost none of their market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.609" offset="1852921">And there is no evidence of any high barriers to entry in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.123" offset="1878939">It was a highly competitive market; therefore, where could an inference be drawn that predation would make any sense, that there could ever be a recoupment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.228" offset="1915406">The plaintiffs don't address themselves to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.149" offset="1923034">The court of appeals did not address itself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.977" offset="1930348">There is no evidence whatever of a sharing mechanism among these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.006" offset="1954486">Thus, the undisputed facts of this case show that the pricing activities of the defendants in the United States are entirely indistinguishable from normal pricing activities by competitors, and that there is no basis for an inference of predatory purpose behind their activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.955" offset="2154270">They said that as time went on, they built plants to produce more, which doesn't suggest a predatory purpose, Your Honor, but it suggests that there is competition taking place, and they are attempting now to satisfy increasing shares in the United States through investment in new plant and facilities; not that they had it on their hands and had to dump itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.380" offset="2272030">They were members of trade associations, Your Honor, and they exchange a lot of kinds of information that people do in trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.893" offset="2302019">There is some evidence that there was allegedly collusive activities in the Japanese market designed to hold up the prices of the Japanese market, but there is no evidence that would show any rational, logical or natural connection between that and activities in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.981" offset="2362414">And on this record of the type of activities that were engaged in in the United States, such a connection would not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.087" offset="2386864">What really happened here is that when it came to the critical, Your Honor, when it came to the critical question of what was happening in the United States market, whether the activities in the United States market showed the signs of conspiracy, the court of appeals said it did not have to follow this Court's inference standards for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.580" offset="2468784">The court of appeals said that the fact that it saw some evidence of some collusion in Japan and that it saw the Japanese companies engaging in their government's export program, which would have had a natural tendency to hold up prices in the United States, not drive them down, but since it saw some collusion someplace, it said all it had to do then as far as the critical question of what was going on in the United States market is see some</text>
            <text syncTime="608.568" offset="2576722">"circumstantial evidence having some tendency to suggest that other kinds of conduct of concert of action may have occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="617.315" offset="2611726">And that's at page 165a of the record, and there the court, in deciding the critical question of whether the activities in the United States were beneficial to American consumers or were injurious, collusive activities, said we look at it in terms of possibilities, not what flows naturally and logically from the record, as this Court required in Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.416" offset="2700125">And to make that point unmistakably clear, the court expressly said that a line of Third Circuit cases based on Cities Service did not apply and that the court did not have to follow the usual rules of the inference-drawing process.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="651.582" stopTime="665.171">

            <text syncTime="651.582" offset="2748817">Let me just... You focus our attention on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.128" offset="2763028">The court says direct evidence of some kinds of concert of action like price fixing in Japan may be circumstantial evidence of a broader conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.000" offset="2794479">Do you agree or disagree with that statement of law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald J. Zoeller</label>
            <text syncTime="665.171" offset="2803152">Your Honor, under some circumstances they might be, but on the record of this case there's no basis to suggest that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.981" offset="2826348">Then, in other words, what the court was really saying, and it's the point I addressed earlier, that the pricing activities in the Japanese market were designed to create profits that could be then poured into the United States market to assume losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.896" offset="2882041">That is a design of predatory intent, but on this record with 20 years having gone by and no opportunity to recoup and no possibility of a rational inference that recoupment could take place in the near future, such an inference would not be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.281" offset="2947557">So, the relationship was not shown in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.217" offset="2963335">Those activities did not constitute circumstantial evidence of a U.S. pricing conspiracy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.168" offset="2991129">The proof of the putting, if the court had looked at it from the standpoint of the United States market, the proof of the putting is that by the plaintiffs' own theory, for 20 unbroken years all of the pricing activities of the Japanese defendants in the American market were beneficial to American consumers, because it is the plaintiffs' contention that those prices were always low; that they brought down pricing competition in the United States market.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.360" offset="3099903">But at the end of the period the two American market leaders are still the American market leaders with no loss of market share and no basis for a rational suggestion that that condition would change at any time in the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.245" offset="3155491">On the basis of that, to suggest predatory conspiracy when you see none of its footprints in the United States market we say is a wrong reading of the law of inference and a dangerous standpoint, because now the United States antitrust laws are used by those who wish to protect themselves from competition as a way of blocking competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.283" offset="3243576">Mr. Zoeller, do you think the Cities Service case laid down a rule of inference drawing through summary judgment that's peculiar to antitrust law, or does it apply across the board in summary judgment?</text>

            <text syncTime="788.700" offset="3297284">It applies basic the principles of inference drawing, but it does have cognizance, I believe, of another principle as well and that is, in addition to the fact that it's wrong and inappropriate to draw an inference of... to draw an inference unless that inference flows naturally and logically from the facts before you, it is also dangerous, and I think the Cities Service case recognized it, from the standpoint of antitrust policy to take conduct that could either be competition or could possibly be conspiracy and treat it as conspiracy because, as this Court warned in Monsanto, there is a danger of intruding on normal competitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.888" offset="3450048">So, I think both policies coalesce in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.398" offset="3508040">That might be possibly so, but to the extent that Cities Service also says that the inference of conspiracy must be natural and logical, it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.551" offset="3540641">But the same broader policy that the record must be rationally explainable in terms of conspiracy than in terms of inference, which is the Cities Service standard as we read it, would not necessarily have to apply in a fraud case.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.170" offset="3591109">The court of appeals committed a second fundamental error when it Failed to apply the sovereign compulsion and active state defenses to the conduct of the Japanese defendants in following their government's export program.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.304" offset="3655684">The Japanese government has said in a clear, detailed, explicit and unequivocal statement and in a note verbal that it compelled the conduct in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.238" offset="3707406">That should be recognized for reasons, among others, that the defense is supported in this case by the American government, by the executive branch of this government.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.935" offset="3750247">It is appropriate because the conduct, the program by the Japanese government is a fundamental government program, the control and regulation of its own exports; because it was not designed by the Japanese government to be harmful to the United States but to avoid trade frictions with this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.282" offset="4351586">This case, we believe, is an unfortunate example of the distortion of the antitrust laws by competitors to thwart competition; precisely the sort of case that the rules of Cities Service were created for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.559" offset="4396726">It's important to note and remember the background of this case in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.761" offset="4413548">After nine years of discovery, seven different judges, hundreds of depositions and literally hundreds of thousands of documents, district Judge Becker took several months to sift through the evidence very carefully and wrote a 430 page opinion granting the petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no reasonable inference that could be drawn from all the evidence of a low price conspiracy that injured the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.115" offset="4610930">Judge Becker, though, in deciding the summary judgment motions, in effect assumed, arguendo, that certain evidence was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.113" offset="4642904">Moreover, when you look at the evidence that the court of appeals relied on in reversing Judge Becker, and when you distill it down to its essence, essentially you have four facts that the court of appeals relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.700" offset="4701313">The respondents have characterized those facts in various ways to make the list look a little broader and bigger, but the fact is there are four facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.399" offset="4732033">And because there was direct evidence as to at least two of those facts, the court felt that it didn't have to apply the rules of inference drawing of Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.647" offset="4765052">However, I think when you look at those four facts, either individually or together, the four facts are not even probative circumstantial evidence of an agreement to charge low prices in the United States that injured the respondents, much less direct evidence of such an agreement: therefore, Cities Services requires summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.155" offset="4847077">Those four facts are essentially these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.136" offset="4858988">First, there was an agreement, let's assume, to stabilize price in a protected Japanese market; that is, the Japanese got together, the petitioners in this case, to fix prices, hold them up at higher levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.522" offset="4920533">They were protected from competition from foreign parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.176" offset="4931191">Now, that very well have injured Japanese consumers, but no one, including the respondents, would argue that that's an American antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.111" offset="4962956">Next, the court relied on Japanese mandated export control arrangements and so-called check price agreements, which fixed the minimum export prices below which the petitioners were not to sell in the United States, and the so-called five company rule, which established that the petitioners could only sell to five customers in the United States, although one of those customers could be their subsidiary who could in turn resell to almost anyone in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.585" offset="5068804">If these agreements were effective at all, and I think that even respondents recognize that they were less effective than the Japanese would have liked, the effect of those agreements was simply to keep prices higher in the United States to, in effect, reduce the competitive vigor of Japanese manufacturers in this market, and while that may be objectionable under the antitrust laws, it certainly doesn't create the sort of antitrust violation that the respondents have alleged, in that indeed they must prove to establish injury that they are entitled to claim under the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.357" offset="5311952">The third fact is the secret rebates that were not disclosed by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.230" offset="5331387">In effect, the petitioners engaged in, so the court said, more than 25 different rebating schemes that resulted in prices varying from the very lowest to the very highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.163" offset="5367122">Again, this is more indicative of individuals evading regulatory constraints that hampered their individual efforts to try to compete in the marketplace and sell at the lowest price possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.284" offset="5407664">The final fact was the allegations that the petitioners sold at dumping prices in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.796" offset="5437653">Again, the petitioners dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.187" offset="5447266">Even assuming that it's true, it's to be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.531" offset="5456566">You had a Japanese market that was protected, where there was a price stabilization agreement; therefore, prices were artificially high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.450" offset="5480285">In the United States, you had a competitive environment; no protected market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.746" offset="5493450">It's inevitable that prices would be lower in the United States than Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.152" offset="5507034">It simply proves nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.448" offset="5512259">Taken together, the inference is overwhelming that the evidence is indicative of individual competitors responding unilaterally and vigorously to market forces; in effect, their new entrance, the petitioners, through the relevant time, trying to make a place in the market by competing on the basis of price, trying to develop customer loyalty, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.814" offset="5597731">Now, that may have injured the respondents, but that's competition, and competition is what the antitrust laws are designed to promote, not to thwart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.453" offset="5632317">We believe that the Third Circuit's decision offers strong encouragement, if it's upheld, to beleaguered competitors seeking protection from the vigors of competition, and we think that's precisely the wrong thing that the antitrust laws should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.945" offset="5686234">The threat of treble damages and never-ending litigation such as this is precisely the sort of thing that can, in effect, undermine the competitive enthusiasm of very efficient firms and result in the perversion of prices and competition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.547" offset="5768677">We are very much concerned, the United States government, about this case and about the abuse it pretends for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.389" offset="5796053">To the extent the protection of domestic industries from foreign competition is necessary, there is an extensive body of trade laws with safeguards to do precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.433" offset="5832206">It seems to us that unless the courts are willing and able to enter summary judgment in suits such as this, respect for the antitrust laws at home and abroad will be seriously eroded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.177" offset="5879227">For all these reasons, including as I have indicated the fact that we believe the statements, two statements, by the Japanese government, that they compelled the export control arrangements, the five company rule and the check price agreement, and that therefore evidences to those agreements cannot be the basis of liability against the petitioners, that for all these reasons the Court should reverse the Third Circuit and reinstate the summary judgment on dismissing respondents' antitrust claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.067" offset="6030737">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.987" offset="6054456">At the argument below which lasted two full days, counsel for petitioners here said that what the court had to do was to look at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.590" offset="6108791">That's what the case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.558" offset="6120703">The court of appeals did exactly that over a period of fourteen months, examining a record of some 18,000 pages, as its lengthy opinion shows in detail, and decided unanimously that there are disputed issues of material fact which preclude the grant of summary judgment to petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.329" offset="6219759">The court of appeals said that respondents are entitled to have a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.889" offset="6250061">After 12 years of the most arduous effort in which we had to overcome every possible and conceivable defensive tactic, the court of appeals reached its decision after reversing most of the evidentiary rulings of the district court and after a careful consideration of the restated evidentiary record, much of which came from the files of the petitioners themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.845" offset="6365836">In doing so, the court of appeals applied the appropriate standards of sufficiency or evidence of a Sherman Act conspiracy and correctly drew all reasonable inferences in favor of respondents who were the opponents of the summary judgment motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.370" offset="6439919">In fact, the court below tested the respondents' evidence by an unusually stringent standard under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.537" offset="6484641">Thus, the court of appeals ignored the fact that petitioners' summary judgment motions were inadequately based, in that on their own application to the district court they had been relieved from filing their final pretrial statement setting forth their view of the evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.513" offset="6568546">Under the normal summary judgment procedures, this would alone have been sufficient to require their motions to be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.088" offset="6602819">Instead, the court tested the sufficiency of the respondents' evidence, sifted through the massive factual record for the l4 months, and upheld unanimously the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.925" offset="6666139">In addition, respondents' unrebutted expert economic reports evidence analyzing the admissible evidence and concluding that it pointed only to collusion is dispositive, we respectfully submit, on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.293" offset="6735625">Now, petitioners argue that the concept of sovereign compulsion insulates them from liability for the wrongful acts done in the United States which restrained the interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.864" offset="6793930">This, with great respect for my friends, is a false issue belatedly raised and is based on an obvious misinterpretation of what the court of appeals said and did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.595" offset="6840846">The Solicitor General, in his brief, acknowledges and concedes that sovereign compulsion is an affirmative defense, yet it was not raised by petitioners in their answers to the complaints with the exception of MELKO, which posed it in the context of questioning subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.196" offset="6919214">But both the district court and the court of appeals have upheld subject matter jurisdiction, which holdings are not questioned in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.629" offset="6952964">Sovereign compulsion was not discussed by the district court and was not briefed or argued in the court of appeals, again except by MELKO in the context of a question as to subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.171" offset="7007194">In fact, counsel for petitioners, my friend here, told the court of appeals that sovereign compulsion was of no importance on the appeal and was not being pressed by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.588" offset="7064872">The court of appeals in its decision cited specific reasons why summary judgment on the ground of sovereign compulsion was not possible, the most important being that petitioners simply did not do what they say the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan directed them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.640" offset="7153062">And that is unquestionably the fact, because MITI did not direct the petitioners to dump or to lie to the U.S. Customs on the thousands of entry documents about their prices in the United States, or to lie to the U.S. Treasury about their prices in their responses to the government proceedings and to the Antidumping Act of 1921, or to sell their products in the United States below the so-called minimum or check prices, or to pay millions of dollars in so-called difference money in a myriad of secret ways in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.781" offset="7313558">Moreover, there simply cannot be compulsion since, under the very Japanese export and import trading act on which my friends rely, petitioners had the right to withdraw from the very agreements that are here in evidence, which right to withdraw could not, under the Japanese statute, be unduly restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.929" offset="7410211">That it was intentional on their part and not directed or compelled by MITI is evidenced by the fact that it is admitted that the petitioners continued their course of conduct after there was not a renewal of the agreements and rules in 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.040" offset="10178668">It should be noted with regard to the 1975 statement from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry on which my friends rely that that statement was sent five years after the NUE complaint was filed, eight months after the Zenith complaint was filed, and long after petitioners had filed their answers to the complaint, without raising the affirmative defense of sovereign compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.701" offset="10297264">That MITI statement is unsigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.718" offset="10425369">--No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.312" offset="10427772">What I'm attempting to suggest is that the issue of sovereign compulsion is not properly in our respectful submission before the Court because, number one, even if it be assumed that MITI mandated or directed the petitioners to do something, they did not do what MITI directed them to do, as I've attempted to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.866" offset="10517947">And I'm attempting now to turn my attention, if I may, sir, to the diplomatic communications which have come from the Japanese Embassy, because the MITI statement itself makes no reference to the right to withdraw, and the communication from the embassy of Japan when first transmitted in 1975 made no reference, however, to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.590" offset="10612824">But in 1984, six months after the court of appeals had handed down its decision, then there is again a transmittal of the same 1975 MITI statement by the Japanese embassy, and then a parenthetical reference which seeks to import into the 1975 statement a reference to the five company rule which is not there in the original statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.190" offset="10715224">We say, therefore, that those diplomatic communications do not meet the normal criteria recognized to give effectiveness to a diplomatic communication, in that they were neither timely nor sufficiently specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.965" offset="10770290">Now, what happened then is that in addition to sovereign compulsion, which we say is a false issue, there is indeed the further point that even if there had been a mandate by MITI of what they did under the decisions of this Court going back 80 years, that would not prevent that conduct being admissible in evidence and being a part of the overall course of conduct which is capable of being shown to violate our laws, because 80 years ago this Court said no conduct has such an absolute privilege as to justify all possible schemes of which it may be a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.338" offset="10955864">The most innocent and constitutionally protected facts may be made a step in a criminal plot, and it is... if it is a step in a plot, neither its innocence nor the Constitution is sufficient to prevent the punishment of the plot by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.566" offset="11016781">Our contention, therefore, is that if constitutionally protected conduct, speech, may become a part in a scheme which violates the law and force your right, this purported unspecific mandate from MITI may similarly be so considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.808" offset="11089715">A word should be added here, if I may, about the position advanced by the brief of the Solicitor General that although the government prosecuted these same petitioners for many years under the 1921 Antidumping Act, ultimately successfully, in which proceedings neither the petitioners nor the Japanese government ever raised the defense of sovereign compulsion, the U.S. government in its brief now argues inconsistently against the respondents pursuing their private rights of action against the same petitioners for the same course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.356" offset="11239867">It is suggested by the Solicitor General's brief that sovereign compulsion should not be available in the action brought by the U.S. government, but that it should be limited in its applicability to suits by private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.522" offset="11292530">This novel contention, we suggest, is unprecedented, and runs afoul not only of the long recognition by this Court that the private litigant has been a bulwark of the enforcement of the antitrust laws, but also of the specific grant by the Congress of private rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.905" offset="11362120">If there is to be a change in that law, it should be legislated by the Congress, we respectfully suggest, not in response to a rather casual reference in an amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.855" offset="11405901">But in similar fashion, petitioners' formulation of the conspiracy issue in terms of alleged parallel acts and other circumstantial evidence is again a false issue in our view and a misstatement of what the circuit court said and did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.599" offset="11472879">The court below expressly said that this is not simply a parallel action case, nor is it one based on circumstantial evidence alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.828" offset="11509764">On the contrary, the circuit court carefully distinguished the line of cases based on conscious parallelism from this case, which presents a record in which there is both direct evidence of certain kinds of concert of action and circumstantial evidence which suggests certain other kinds of concert of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.758" offset="11593460">The court of appeals expressly said that thus none of those conscious parallelism cases can be dispositive on the propriety of summary judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.425" offset="11644138">The court of appeals followed the direction of this Court in refusing to fragment the evidence and examined all the admissible evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the restated evidentiary record to determine what legitimate inference could be drawn as to the ultimate facts in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.073" offset="11722819">Contrary to the contentions by my friends, the court of appeals did not create an exception to the rule in Cities Service, which was a totally different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.443" offset="11768272">There, in Cities Service, was not a horizontal price fixing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.066" offset="11786766">Petitioners in Cities Service were not competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.565" offset="11800768">It was conceded there that the interests of Cities Service were directly opposed to those of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.546" offset="11828667">Mr. Justice Marshall noted that the record cited an overwhelming amount of evidence as to Cities Service motives, which evidence came from Cities Service itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.868" offset="11881957">In that case, the only evidence there cited was the refusal to buy, while in our case there is extensive evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of collusion, meetings at all levels, exchanges of all kinds of information, including price information, aimed at the U.S. market and carefully coordinated concealed activities that leave no doubt about petitioners' conscious commitment to a common scheme to achieve an unlawful objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.122" offset="12006926">Whereas, Cities Service made a conclusive showing on its part, in actuality what happened here below was that there was no showing by the petitioners at all, because as I have said they were relieved on their own application by the district court of any obligation to file their final pretrial statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.942" offset="12094280">Mr. Justice Marshall, in Cities Service, said the question whether summary judgment is appropriate in any case is one to be decided upon the particular facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.422" offset="12144121">Here, petitioners simply ignore the vastly different evidentiary record of our case in their reliance upon the inapposite facts of Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.417" offset="12192187">Petitioners' response to the undisputed record is to argue that the direct evidence of their collusive conduct in Japan relates to a different conspiracy from the one alleged by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.584" offset="12240775">They seek, thereby, to impermissibly fragment their unitary course of conduct, the single conspiracy that we have charged, into two separate conspiracies and to argue that what they did in Japan is nonactionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.217" offset="12311305">The reason why they say it is nonactionable is because of the alleged mandate from MITI, which I have attempted to refer to in my argument about sovereign compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.870" offset="12345996">Whatever MITI directed the petitioners to do lost its exempt character when it became part of petitioners' common design and understanding regarding their conduct outside of Japan which affected the interstate and foreign commerce of the U.S., and in any event, their conduct and agreements in Japan are admissible in our case to illuminate the character and effect of their conduct in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.529" offset="12464592">Moreover, their attempt to fragment the record into different conspiracies and to take up each piece of evidence item by item, scrutinize it, and then wipe the slate clean runs counter to the dictate of this Court in Continental Ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.446" offset="12524255">The entire body of evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to respondents to give them the benefit of all inferences which the evidence fairly supports even the contrary inferences... even though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.642" offset="12589039">Nor was it permissible for the district court to attempt, as it did, to decide which reasonable inferences are the more probable, because as has been said in Tennant, cited again in Continental Ore, it is not the function of the court to search the record for conflicting circumstantial evidence nor to take the case away from the jury on a theory that the proof gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.522" offset="12704605">Petitioners have not really challenged, because they cannot challenge our statement of the procedural history of this case and the careful detailed reference to the factual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.766" offset="12753506">The conclusory arguments of lawyers cannot prevail over the particular facts of this case established by evidence held to be admissible, which evidentiary rulings are not subject of attack here before Your Honors, and when it is all examined together without fragmenting, we saw that it reasonably tends to prove that petitioners had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective, and therefore the court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.346" offset="12899896">If I was able, successfully, to pick my way through the last part of Mr. Rome's argument, I think he and I did agree on one thing, and that is that the Third Circuit did not follow the teachings of the Cities Service case, and they had good reason not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.654" offset="12953081">The record would not support a rational, logical inference that a conspiracy to establish predatory low prices in the United States ever existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.652" offset="12981085">Indeed, this is an unusual case where the record directly rebuts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.790" offset="13001669">That is perhaps the reason, also, why Mr. Rome, now having spent an additional half hour, has never touched on the question of what the record of the activities of these companies in the United States market was; hasn't discussed their pricing activities; disavows any intention to show that there was recoupment; shows no way that those activities could be distinguished from the competition beneficial to consumers which the antitrust laws are seeking to foster, not to squelch.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.074" offset="13138760">In other words, I am saying that this is an inference case, and in order to draw an inference that there was a predatory conspiracy, in order to distinguish the activities of these companies, the pricing activities from competition, predation would be an essential part of what they're saying.</text>
