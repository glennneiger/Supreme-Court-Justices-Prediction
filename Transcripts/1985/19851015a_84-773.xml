            <text syncTime="14.433" offset="202989">The facts of this case are not extremely complicated, but they can be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.572" offset="223574">This case does not involved teacher-led or government-prescribed religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.351" offset="246666">Very simply, students from Williamsport Area High School, which we represent, wanted to meet during the extracurricular activity period.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.739" offset="280207">The school was originally content to let them meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.081" offset="297553">Then permission was withdrawn after the first meeting, but solely because the school's lawyer felt that allowing student meetings containing prayer and religious expression would violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.373" offset="354709">Now, since the lawyer's belief was the only reason for the denial of meeting space in this case, the legal issue is very narrow and that is simply whether the Establishment Clause requires a high school to censor out the religious expression of private individuals after having first created an opportunity for students to engage in their own self-initiated activities and expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.632" offset="4987786">On the jurisdictional point, Justice Stevens, we do discuss that on page five of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.518" offset="5015371">It is fairly intricate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.924" offset="5020909">I would like to proceed to the rather puzzling point in the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.078" offset="5053615">One wonders why in this case we have had the new notion introduced that free speech has got to be balanced against the Establishment Clause and, indeed, that free speech must yield to the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.087" offset="5117562">This case is not like Wallace and Jaffree last term or Stone v. Graham where the Court could point to a state statute which the Court concluded sought by direction or indirection to endorse religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.206" offset="5178062">And, indeed, this case is easier, should be viewed as easier than its older twin brother, Widmar against Vincent, because in Widmar the state had reasons of its own, quite apart from the federal Establishment Clause, for wishing to limit the access of those students to their religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.947" offset="5269073">Here, the controverted action... the controverted activity was entirely student initiated and there was no state objection apart from the lawyer's objection based on the federal Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.815" offset="5328527">So, here we have no endorsement of religious and we have no conflict with a substantive state educational policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.359" offset="5362695">If you compare this case to cases of incidental, but permissible state involvement, tax exemption in Walz, school books and text books for parochial school students, or the use of the mall for a papal mass, one sees that the objective involvement of the state is virtually negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.208" offset="5470111">So, how is it that this case is thought to present these agonizing constitutional difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.688" offset="5499995">Only on one premise and that is that high school students are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.295" offset="5522460">There is the fear that unlike the rest of us high school students are unable to discern the difference between neutrality and endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.714" offset="5568122">That is the fear which moved the Court of Appeals in its decision and that is the fear which is raised by the Respondents and the amici in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.740" offset="5612217">Now, whether that fear is justified, whether high school students, indeed, are so immature that they cannot make the distinctions that the rest of us make was a question which was specifically addressed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.234" offset="5674180">Hearings were held, testimony was taken, materials were examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.841" offset="5696645">And, Congress concluded that high school students... secondary school students was the word of the statute... are sufficiently mature to make the same distinctions that the rest of us make, that all of us have to make when that papal mass was held on the mall, to distinguish between state endorsement and state neutrality towards religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.502" offset="5795283">And, this Court has consistently held, most recently in Rostker and Goldberg, that where Congress has made a determination of a controverted matter of general fact, that disposition is entitled to the very highest degree of deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.996" offset="5865291">This case cannot be affirmed without controverting that congressional judgment about the maturity of secondary school students and rejecting the major premise of the Equal Access Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.614" offset="5927672">That is why I say the federal interest is direct and substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.723" offset="5944181">Now, once that factual premise is accepted, high school students do understand the difference between neutrality and endorsement, this becomes the easiest of cases for we are far from any actual endorsement of religion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.261" offset="6014294">If the Court has no further questions, I thank you for its attention.</text>
