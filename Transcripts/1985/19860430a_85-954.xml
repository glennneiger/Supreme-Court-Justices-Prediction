            <text syncTime="15.593" offset="201328">This too is a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.145" offset="219614">The question before the Court is whether an executive agreement between two sovereign nations, the United States and Japan, the practical effect of which is to end whaling by Japanese nationals no later than April 1, 1988, is to be nullified by an interpretation of two federal statutes known as the Pelly Amendment and the Packwood Amendment, which strips the Executive Branch, of any and all discretion and mandates, mandates severe economic sanctions against Japan, a country whose nationals take whales in excess of the harvest quotas established by the International Whaling Commission.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="71.078" offset="423264">You are not suggesting, then, if Congress clearly intended to do that it would be unconstitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="76.632" offset="445521">No, I am not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.965" offset="450850">We are talking about a statute enacted by Congress pursuant to which Congress directed the Executive Branch to implement and to execute the law, and I think that you'll find that as the argument progresses, Justice White, there's been a very happy collaboration between the Congress and the Executive Branch which has together made tremendous strides over the years in the conservation and protection of whales.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.138" offset="587522">You wouldn't know that from the brief that the Congress has filed in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_i_burns" startTime="115.590" stopTime="220.407">
            <label>Mr. Arnold I. Burns</label>
            <text syncTime="115.590" offset="601315">No, you wouldn't, but I shall try to embellish that point as we proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.577" offset="625348">The Pelly Amendment, the principal statute, provides, and I should like to quote it:</text>
            <text syncTime="131.349" offset="664427">"When the Secretary of Commerce determines that nationals of a foreign country, directly or indirectly, are conducting fishing operations in a manner or under circumstances which diminish the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program, the Secretary of Commerce shall certify such fact to the President. "</text>
            <text syncTime="156.564" offset="765259">Now, if there is a certification, then the statute goes on to provide that the President may direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the bringing or importation of fish from the offending country into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.260" offset="835999">Now, there is no issue in this case, we all agree, that that portion of the statute dealing with the President's authority is purely discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.799" offset="870167">The Packwood Amendment, enacted in 1979, eight years after the Pelly Amendment was enacted, contains a similar certification provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.975" offset="922934">Under the Packwood Amendment, if there is indeed a certification, then the Secretary of Commerce, working with the Secretary of State, must... must reduce the amount of fish by at least 50 percent that the offending country can take from United States fishery waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.639" offset="1013527">There is no issue in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="224.293" offset="1036201">--Yes, but as the court below found and as I think we all agree, the language which I quoted in the Pelly Amendment is the language which the Court must address in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.702" offset="1085834">There is no issue but that the sanction in the Packwood Amendment is a mandatory sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.772" offset="1110076">We all agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.639" offset="1113524">The National Whaling Commission, created by the International Convention for the regulation of whaling, by the adoption of schedules among other things imposed a zero quota for the harvesting of sperm whales effective in April of 1984, and adopted a complete moratorium on all commercial whaling to be effective in April of 1986, this very month.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.077" offset="1239330">Japan filed timely objections to these schedules, and as a consequence under international law is not bound to abide by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.968" offset="1286872">There is no dispute in the case about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.234" offset="1295963">On November 13th, 1984, following extensive negotiations in which the United States made it very clear to Japan that sanctions under these amendments were definitely in the cards, the United States and Japan struck a deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.964" offset="1370882">In exchange for Japan's pledge to assiduously adhere to new quotas that were established in respect of sperm whales, minke whales and Bryde's whales, in the interim, Japan would definitely give up all commercial whaling by April of 1988.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.803" offset="3718245">At the time, in 1979, this is what was said concerning the Pelly Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.159" offset="3759623">Now, the question must be asked, what did Congress have in mind when they adopted the Packwood Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.514" offset="3789090">They may... they provided for mandatory sanctions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.132" offset="3807480">What did Congress have in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="918.834" offset="3814376">And the answer to the question is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.953" offset="3826810">What Congress had in mind was, in adding teeth and giving the Executive Branch additional negotiating chips at the bargaining table, and the idea was that after the Packwood Amendment took place, that offending nations or nations that might become offending nations, would no longer have two bites at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.402" offset="3920642">They would only have one bite at the negotiating apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.187" offset="3935793">And, that is not conjecture on my part, because Representative Brow said,</text>
            <text syncTime="954.924" offset="3958676">"I understand under the Pelly Amendment as it exists there are really two areas in which there are optional actions that can be taken by the Administration. "</text>
            <text syncTime="967.165" offset="4007682">"First, in certifying that a country is in violation of some international agreement, and there is a lot of flexibility in that certification. "</text>
            <text syncTime="976.605" offset="4045403">"And second, after a nation is certified, there is still discretion in determining whether a ban on imports of that country's products will be in fact imposed against that country. "</text>
            <text syncTime="989.162" offset="4095663">Therefore, under Pelly we have two discretionary features, whereas in the Packwood Amendment you are really taking all of the discretionary features and putting them into their first category which is the certification of a nation being in violation of an international agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.461" offset="5240871">Before doing so, I'd like to clarify a couple of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.199" offset="5255813">Justice Brennan, you asked about the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.167" offset="5271695">The moratorium that was established will continue indefinitely unless the International Whaling Commission in 1990, based upon scientific evidence, decides that whale stocks are at a sufficiently high level to permit the resumption of whaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.878" offset="5346510">And it is partly a reflection of that fact, why the Murazumi-Baldridge agreement was to the advantage of the preservation of whales, because the Japanese would cease whaling, will cease whaling, if the agreement is not stricken down, as of April 1, 1988.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.574" offset="5525292">So, the moratorium for practical purposes will continue indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.728" offset="5545876">The other point that I'd like to clarify, Justice Blackmun, is the matter of the whaling populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.719" offset="5597912">Those figures are given in the first portion, pages 3, 4 and 5 of the Japanese petitioner's reply brief, and they give you two sets of figures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.917" offset="7542676">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.552" offset="7557201">In our judgment there is one issue properly before the Court in this case, and that is, what the law is, what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.193" offset="7611744">There has been considerable discussion about a number of other interesting issues which are not, I think, except by the most attenuated notions strictly legal, such as whale populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.804" offset="7674229">Mr. Whitney has cited gross numbers for global populations but has not suggested to the Court that they may be misleading with respect to the capacity of whale populations in subgroups to maintain their levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.100" offset="7743401">There is considerable dispute amongst scientists about that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.718" offset="7757821">There is also the question Mr. Whitney has brought forward, whether the Commission violated its own conventions, which I am not sure is properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.841" offset="7794392">The issue of whether Japan has committed itself to stop whaling, I'd remind the Court that in the Baldridge-Murazumi Agreement the sole commitment Japan made was to withdraw its objections to the moratorium and quotas established by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.119" offset="7871506">But that leaves before Japan the possibility of scientific whaling, aboriginal whaling and in the end, if it chooses' to, the withdrawal from the convention, by which time the lever now exercised by the United States under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment of exclusion from the U.S. fishing zone will, as the Baldridge affidavit in this very case points out, be considerably less significant to Japan because of the fact that American fishermen will have occupied the available take in the 200-mile limit toward the close of this decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.779" offset="8030121">In any event, we have suggested these are not the central issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.116" offset="8055512">The central issue before the Court is whether or not the Secretary had the discretion he purported to exercise here to agree not to impose the sanction under Packwood-Magnuson in which all sides agree is mandatory when there is a certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.412" offset="8132626">The issue, whether or not sanctions should be mandatory or should be the subject of extensive negotiation and diplomatic accommodation has been an issue present in the debates over congressional regulation of whaling from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.760" offset="8226040">In 1971, as has been pointed out, the Pelly Amendment was passed providing for a discretionary sanction of banning imports when the Secretary determined that there was an action diminishing the effectiveness of the international whaling system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.793" offset="8314125">In that year, I might point out, Congress also enacted resolutions for the first time favoring a worldwide moratorium on whaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.915" offset="8358637">In our judgment, the language of Pelly is quite persuasive to the proposition that the Secretary of Commerce had no discretion with respect to the first stage of the process; that is to say, the stage with respect to certification, and that Congress clearly incorporated what it thought then to be appropriate discretion with respect to the second stage of the process, that is, whether or not to impose sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.636" offset="8489563">But if there is any doubt about the appropriateness of that interpretation of Pelly, that is to say mandatory on stage one with respect to certification, optional or discretionary with respect to sanctions in stage two, in our judgment that doubt is entirely removed by first the eight-year history of administrative implementation of the statute because, as Mr. Burns has pointed out, there were five certifications which occurred between the time Pelly was enacted and the time Congress considered the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.447" offset="8648805">During that eight-year period in every instance, as far as Congress was aware in 1979, in every instance in which a nation had violated a numerical quota on taking, the Secretary acted quickly and automatically and certified to the President that a taking had occurred which diminished the effectiveness of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.864" offset="8758415">And indeed, President Ford made the point crystal-clear in his explanation of the certification of Japan and the Soviet Union in 1974 when he said, whether or not the objection by the violating nation to the quota is legal does not alter the fact that exceeding quotas will diminish the effectiveness of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.384" offset="8872518">It constitutes, then, he said, a prima facie case; that is to say, a case which should suggest to the President the exercise of his discretionary authority to impose the sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.238" offset="9107934">But Packwood-Magnuson, as you can see, was specifically targeted on whaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.623" offset="9129459">So too in 1978, if it please the Court, the compliance had already begun to occur by Chile, Peru and South Korea, and yet because of their violations the Secretary automatically issued the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.418" offset="9200721">In all five cases, however, the Executive Branch stayed its hand, it did not impose the Pelly sanctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.613" offset="11813488">I would suggest, with all due respect, that so palpable is it that Congress was intending to close what it saw as the loophole in the Pelly Amendment by enacting the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment, that there can't be any doubt about the appropriate interpretation of the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.330" offset="11912335">The idea that there is discretion with respect to intentional quota violations lurking in the certification stage is advanced really in this case for the first time in history of the entire consideration of these statutes, and it would in our judgment bring in by the back door the very discretion that Congress intended to eliminate from the Packwood-Magnuson statutory scheme relating to the privilege of foreigners to fish in our waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.064" offset="12023303">This is a view, incidentally, which was embraced by the defendant, Mr. Baldridge, himself when he communicated with the author of the amendment, Mr. Packwood, just a few weeks before he made the bilateral arrangement with Japan when he said, in response to Mr. Packwood's statement,</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.990" offset="12090908">"I see no way around the logical conclusion that a nation which ignores the moratorium is diminishing the effectiveness of the IWC. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.993" offset="12114941">Mr. Baldridge said, "I agree".</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.529" offset="12125076">Quote, "Since any such whaling", that is to say, in violation of the quotas,</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.499" offset="12149005">"any such whaling attributable to the policies of a foreign government would clearly diminish the effectiveness of the IWC. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.837" offset="12174396">Now, we don't contend that this subsequent exchange bears on the congressional intent in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.176" offset="12203653">You have heard a good deal about deference to Executive Branch officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.378" offset="12220476">In our judgment, if any deference is due to any Executive Branch official it's due to the views and representations upon which Congress relied of the senior officials who testified to the House in connection with this Packwood-Magnuson Amendment at the time it was under consideration, Mr. Frank and Augusto Negroponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.791" offset="12298216">And in our judgment we are persuaded that the Court will on its own examination of the legislative history be similarly convinced that their testimony is decisive as to the appropriate interpretation of the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.453" offset="14668776">In 1978 the Pelly Amendment itself was amended and it is very clear that the Congress, and our papers demonstrate, regarded this as a discretionary matter.</text>
