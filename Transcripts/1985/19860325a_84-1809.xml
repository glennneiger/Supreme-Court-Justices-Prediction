            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136098">We will hear arguments next in the Federal Trade Commission against Indiana Federation of Dentists.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.474" offset="189910">Ms. Tiffany, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marcy_jk_tiffany" startTime="31.369" stopTime="207.301">
            <label>Ms. Marcy J.K. Tiffany</label>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="261486">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a conspiracy by Indiana dentists to refuse ex-rays requested by group dental health care insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.660" offset="310700">The insurers needed the ex-rays to detect instances of fraudulent claims and overtreatment of dental patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.766" offset="339122">Their goal was to contain the cost of the insurance programs they were administering, a goal that was shared, indeed, insisted upon by those who were footing the bill for the programs, the employers, and unions who had negotiated the dental benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.275" offset="405159">The attitude of the dentists toward this cost containment effort was best summed up in the words of Dr. David McClure, one of the chief organizers of the conspiracy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.416" offset="449672">Dr. McClure characterized the situation as, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="82.552" offset="466286">"economics war where the name of the game is money. "</text>
            <text syncTime="86.439" offset="481750">And like all wars, this one had its victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="494602">Here they were the patients, the consumers, who were deprived of the benefits of the cost containment efforts of the insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.514" offset="530129">The dentists' response to the insurance companies' cost containment efforts should not be surprising, since from their perspective cost containment essentially means fewer dollars for the dentists.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.304" offset="577254">To again quote Dr. McClure,</text>
            <text syncTime="112.689" offset="586762">"Management, government, labor, and the insurance industry are determined to reduce the cost of the dental health dollar at the expense of the dentist. "</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="627931">Now, a third party payer faces a difficult problem with respect to cost containment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.116" offset="652487">In the normal purchase transaction the individual consumer has an interest in making sure that he is not paying for more than he needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.789" offset="687177">However, when an insurer is picking up the tab, consumer self-interest tends to coincide with that of the seller, which is to say, get as much as possible cut of the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.012" offset="736078">Thus, the responsibility is left to the plan administrator for finding some way of making sure that it is paying only for services that are covered under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.070" offset="780278">In this case the dentists were well aware that the ex-rays were needed for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="798981">To quote Dr. McClure yet again,</text>
            <text syncTime="168.526" offset="810162">"The fight for ex-rays will continue, because this is the only way insurance companies can control their costs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="175.664" offset="838687">The fight began with the Indiana Dental Association, which is composed of 85 percent of all licensed dentists in the state of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.869" offset="875572">This group organized the boycott, and did so very effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="895739">They adopted a set of principles of acceptability which specified that insurance plans requiring ex-rays to be submitted would not be acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="931161">They distributed a form letter to their members to give to the patients saying that they would not provide the ex-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.016" offset="960105">They also initiated a pledge--</text>

            <text syncTime="207.301" offset="965225">That was the extent of their boycott, wasn't it, just not providing the ex-rays?</text>

            <text syncTime="213.039" offset="988212">They refused to provide the ex-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.339" offset="997407">They initiated a pledge campaign for dentists to agree in writing that they would abide by the IDA's principles of acceptability.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.561" offset="1022276">They didn't refuse to serve patients that were covered by these health plans?</text>

            <text syncTime="224.512" offset="1034083">No, they would continue to serve patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.196" offset="1040875">They just wouldn't give the ex-rays to the insurance companies so they could determine whether the claim should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.216" offset="1060937">The efforts were very successful, and the Administrative Law Judge found that eventually most Indiana dentists were refusing to provide the ex-rays to the insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.058" offset="1104300">Now, about that time this Court decided the Goldfarb case, which of course held that professions do not enjoy any special immunity from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.830" offset="1147350">The leaders of the IDA boycott were understandably nervous about their possible antitrust liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.770" offset="1175145">The response was to form the Indiana Federation of Dentists under the mistaken belief that if they styled themselves as a union they would be immune from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.125" offset="1216522">To once more quote the irrepressible Dr. McClure, who was the first president of the Indiana Federation of Dentists,</text>
            <text syncTime="276.879" offset="1243585">"They would no longer have the antitrust albatross around their necks. "</text>
            <text syncTime="281.433" offset="1261767">The mandate of IFD was clear, to continue and intensify the boycott that was begun by IDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.289" offset="1297189">Equally clear was the economic motivation for the formation of IFD, as evidenced by, among other things, the constitution and bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.145" offset="1332611">They explicitly stated that IFD was organized to represent the socioeconomic and political interests of the dentists.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.333" offset="1365420">The constitution and bylaws authorized strikes, job actions, or other forms of economic pressure, and they provided for discipline of non-conforming members.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.689" offset="1406798">Based on a record developed after six weeks of trial, the Commission concluded that this conduct reduced or eliminated competition among dentists as to their policy in dealing with third party insurers.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.424" offset="1509721">The Commission seems to have conducted a sort of abbreviated rule of reason analysis here, not really doing a full-blown inquiry into the economic effects of the boycott, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.801" offset="1579207">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.635" offset="1582550">The rule of reason analysis was applied here, although the Administrative Law Judge had found that a per se analysis would have been appropriate to this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.741" offset="1619017">The line, however, between per se and rule of reason is not always a clear one, as this Court noted in the ICAA case, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="386.501" offset="1682025">--I don't believe we would refer to it as an abbreviated rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.404" offset="1697698">The analysis was conducted... a rule of reason analysis was conducted, and it was extensive enough, given the facts in this case, to reach the conclusions that the Commission reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.543" offset="1738240">This restraint was very much like this Court has held... restraints this Court has held to be illegal without an elaborate market analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.449" offset="1773871">Paramont Famous Lasky is a case in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.186" offset="1792784">That case, like this one, involved horizontal competitors who were refusing to deal with third parties except on terms and conditions that they had agreed to, that they had specified between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.244" offset="1836983">It is also very much like the Professional Engineers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.029" offset="1856209">Here, the dentists were restricting the flow of price-related information.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.349" offset="1877420">If this information had been provided, it would have enabled insurers to determine whether the dentists are overtreating, which is the economic functional equivalent of overcharging.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.741" offset="1922978">This in turn would have enabled the insurers to make purchasing determinations that would have lowered their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.828" offset="1951399">Thus, as was the case in Professional Engineers, while this is not a naked price restraint, it is a restraint that directly impacts price.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.453" offset="1989851">Without this type of restraint, decisions as to the types of services purchased would have been made as a function of the interplay of the market forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.974" offset="2031961">Now, the Seventh Circuit did reject the Commission's findings on an evidentiary basis, finding that there was insubstantial evidence to show that the boycott restrained trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.782" offset="2083161">This holding of the Seventh Circuit means that there is really a very narrow issue facing this Court, and that is whether the Court of Appeals misapplied the standard review when it reversed the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.828" offset="2147318">The importance of this case, however, goes far beyond the narrow legal issue to be resolved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.898" offset="2175634">The problem of cost containment in the context of third party insurers is a large one.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.635" offset="2198622">It has dimensions that really dwarf the facts in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.555" offset="2218266">As amicus briefs point out, the serious problem of rapidly rising health costs is one that is here to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.561" offset="2250240">Indeed, problems similar to those encountered by the insurance companies in Indiana are being faced throughout the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.251" offset="2593071">So with respect to Indiana itself the evidence is not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.905" offset="2619716">However, there certainly was evidence of similar restraints being used in other parts of the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.544" offset="5446269">That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and the record shows that the insurance companies were sensitive to that, indeed, in some instances, in trying to negotiate a plan that would be more acceptable, had agreed to do a double pack ex-ray, where the pack would take two ex-rays at the same time, allowing the dentist to have one copy and sending the other copy in to the insurer, and the insurer was willing to pay for the extra cost of that type of ex-ray pack, which was not really very substantial in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.946" offset="5563820">As to the lay examiners that were reviewing these claims, much has been made of lay examiners looking at ex-rays, but the truth of the fact is that the lay examiners could only approve claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.921" offset="5611781">They could not deny claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.040" offset="5620245">It is difficult to imagine how having an insurance company approve the claim submitted by the treating dentist could in any way cause harm to a patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.979" offset="5663922">As to the dental consultants who were reviewing the more questionable ex-rays, these were licensed dentists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.168" offset="5692761">Contrary to respondent's assertions in its brief, the dentists did not rely on the ex-rays alone when making determinations as to the alternate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.273" offset="5733094">Rather, they could and did consult with treating dentists before determining the alternate benefit determinations, and moreover, these were professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.629" offset="5770606">They used their own professional judgment as to what additional information they needed, and in fact were able to access the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.319" offset="5801326">There is nothing in the record that indicates that there was any restraint that they could not look at anything but ex-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.306" offset="5825254">Indeed, there was no evidence here of any alternate benefit determination that was even medically erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.745" offset="5855034">Moreover, nothing in Indiana law exists to justify this boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.113" offset="5876454">There is no express prohibition on lay persons screening the ex-rays, and even if so, there was nothing in Indiana law that would authorize this kind of vigilante group boycott to enforce the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.473" offset="5933923">If you strip away this legal, moral, and ethical veneer that the Seventh Circuit applied to this case, you really are left very much with a case like Professional Engineers, where the professionals were saying, we are the professionals, we know how to do things better than the antitrust laws do, better than the competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.954" offset="6015843">We should not be subject to those constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.672" offset="6030785">Where legitimate pro-competitive justifications exist, this Court has indicated every willingness to countenance them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.011" offset="6064118">But professionals, like other entrepreneurs, have a direct economic incentive to keep the costs of their services high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.902" offset="6103615">This Court accordingly must demand more of professionals than a bare assertion that they know what is best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.989" offset="6136007">As I noted at the outset, this is a war, and the stakes are high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.429" offset="6161711">The cost of health insurance in general and dental health insurance in particular are extremely high and rising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.082" offset="6192327">If these dentists can successful engage in this kind of obstructionist conduct in the face of the abundant record evidence to support the Commission's conclusion of the existence of an antitrust violation here, cost containment efforts in the health care field may well suffer a serious setback.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.062" offset="6272261">Accordingly, the Commission respectfully requests this Court to reverse the decision of the Seventh Circuit below and direct that court to affirm and enforce the order of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.725" offset="6358988">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, contrary to the theme of the Commission, this case should not be viewed as a crusade to lower dental costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.783" offset="6399216">The Commission has not evidenced that these cost containment provisions did contain costs, and specifically refused to do so at the administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.323" offset="6441326">The focus of this case should be the proper application to a non-price restraint wherein there are involved valid health care concerns promulgated here by a small group of Indiana dentists, the IFD, and particularly the review that an appellate court should apply in reviewing the application of a rule of reason under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.521" offset="6538083">Now, as we know, the Seventh Circuit clearly decided that the Commission had failed to evidence anticompetitive effect in a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.812" offset="6575282">Thus, absent the rare instance where the Court of appeals grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard, the Commission should not prevail today, and the Seventh Circuit's decision should stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.204" offset="6624914">I think it is important to kind of look at this from the perspective of the Seventh Circuit as they were analyzing this case initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.893" offset="6659605">They saw 88 dentists which compromised the IFD who had allegedly engaged in a restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.015" offset="6700147">These 88 dentists were scattered around three parts of Indiana, and specifically in Fort Wayne there were 19 IFD dentists out of 139 in the Fort Wayne area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.341" offset="6753437">The Commission in their opinion stated that they were applying a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.310" offset="6773290">The Seventh Circuit expected them to demonstrate a relevant market and anticompetitive effect in that market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.464" offset="6993868">I believe that the Commission's core dispute actually at this point in time is that the Seventh Circuit required a full competitive rule of reason analysis, and that in that analysis they considered IFD's quality of care justifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.957" offset="7271915">That is what they stated they were doing, so that is what I expected in the Seventh Circuit also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.911" offset="7299709">Definitely in this particular case a rule of reason analysis, a full competitive rule of reason analysis was really required, and I think that is evidenced by a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.604" offset="7354462">Initially we find in the initial decision by the Commission a determination that IFD's actions were per se restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.293" offset="7393228">Although the initial decision tees the idea that a rule of reason might be applicable in this case, they said there were no factors to outweigh the clearly anticompetitive effects that had been evidenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.703" offset="7450906">Unfortunately, the initial decision never indicated what those were, just continually referred to clearly anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.809" offset="7491239">The final order of the Commission upon the urging of the IFD agreed that a rule of reason analysis should be applied, and they specifically stated a number of reasons why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.666" offset="7534707">The Commission stated specifically the conduct involved in by IFD was not aimed primarily at excluding competitors, it was not wholly motivated by an anticompetitive purpose, and was a very limited refusal with regard to insurance company mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.661" offset="7602730">Only the ex-ray was withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.947" offset="7611820">All other aspects of the insurer-dentist transaction continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.315" offset="7629270">These are the Commission's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.601" offset="7642436">Now, as to why they applied a rule of reason and rejected per se there are other findings in the Commission's decision which also support application of a rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.824" offset="7687367">They found that... they refused to make a finding that there was any unfairness to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.412" offset="7713698">They correctly found that the insurers were neither a customer nor a competitor of the dentist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.684" offset="7742746">And they found that in essence there was no impact on price, and the Commission failed to evidence any impact on price in the dental industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.964" offset="11311909">I think it is pretty evident what the Commission did in this case was, they stated they were going to apply a rule of reason, but they presumptively concluded IFD had engaged in anticompetitive conduct and then looked for proof of procompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.389" offset="11377633">Well, I don't think that's the way it works, especially in a novel case involving health care concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.643" offset="11402606">The rule of reason requires an analysis of the reasons for the restraint, the history of it, the facts peculiar to the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.066" offset="11436356">That was not engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.268" offset="11449104">Why do all these things need to be done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.720" offset="11454955">To determine the competitive significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.937" offset="11463837">We need to find out who is competing with who on what basis, in what market, and for what reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.825" offset="11495393">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.277" offset="11501140">So that there can be demonstration of anticompetitive effect in a relevant market, as this Court, I believe, has recently indicated again in Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.931" offset="11535726">These are the same concerns the Seventh Circuit had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.716" offset="11546906">Where is the evidence of anticompetitive effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.352" offset="11557460">What is the market that was affected?</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.304" offset="11569267">Well, the Seventh Circuit observed that the Commission held that competition was lessened amongst dentists in their policy of dealing with third party payer insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.762" offset="11615138">That was the gist of their holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.714" offset="11626945">The Seventh Circuit delineated a series of factors that the Commission had failed to even address in their series of conclusory assumptions about the market and competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.521" offset="11670100">They pointed out that the Commission had failed to define the market and competitive forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.841" offset="11691416">They pointed out that there was no real analysis of the total number of dental patients within the relevant market, or the percentage of those covered by insurance in the relevant market, the availability and proximity of other dentists, the fees charged insured patients as opposed to uninsured patients, the policy of non-FDI member dentists in dealing with insurers, or the policy of insurers in evaluating dental treatment plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.945" offset="11807817">There was no analysis of the additional cost to dentists to process claim forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.396" offset="11829656">There was no analysis of potential disincentives posed to dentists for submitting diagnostic aids in violation of fairly well delineated state policies against it dating back to 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.608" offset="11894439">No evidence of price alteration, price stabilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.928" offset="11915755">Now, in short, I believe that the Seventh Circuit found that competitive... competition at issue was not defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.634" offset="11954625">They didn't know who competed with who for what, for what reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.820" offset="11971344">Very little attention has been paid to the patient in this case, which is actually the ultimate consumer of dental benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.508" offset="12006034">They didn't demonstrate an effect on an undefined market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.279" offset="12025156">In conclusion, I believe that the Seventh Circuit... the Commission stated, we are applying a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.935" offset="12055771">Under the circumstances, it needed to be a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.887" offset="12071549">Thus they had a burden to establish anticompetitive effect in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.874" offset="12091507">The Commission is stating something differently now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.743" offset="12111047">They are asking for, I believe, a per se application, or at least some kind of truncated rule of reason application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.281" offset="12141140">Well, the Seventh Circuit found their analysis wholly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.133" offset="12156604">They said rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.585" offset="12162351">They were obligated to establish the effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.870" offset="12183562">And there simply is not a gross misapplication of the substantial evidence test by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.893" offset="12215641">For those reasons, we believe that the Commission should not prevail on their petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.297" offset="12233195">Thank you.</text>
