            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149719">We will hear arguments first this morning in Midlantic National Bank against New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.512" offset="191724">Mr. McEnroe, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_mc_enroe" startTime="17.728" stopTime="211.962">
            <label>Mr. William F. Mc Enroe</label>
            <text syncTime="17.728" offset="220563">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents to the Court the question of the scope of the abandoned tower rented to a trustee in bankruptcy under Section 554(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.830" offset="280958">That section provides that after notice and a hearing, a trustee may abandon a property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or of inconsequential value to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.623" offset="328188">The specific issue here is whether the trustee may abandon property where it is uncontroverted that that property is both burdensome and of inconsequential value, but where abandonment is opposed by governmental agencies on environmental grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.648" offset="392240">The debtor in this case, Quanta Resources Corporation, was engaged in the business of recycling waste oils.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.253" offset="422646">They operated sites in New York and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.517" offset="435708">In 1981, it was determined that there existed on both sites substantial quantities of oil that were contaminated with PCB's.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.545" offset="471861">In July of 1981, Quanta ceased its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.716" offset="488579">At the time it ceased its operations, there were already in effect orders from the states of New York and New Jersey requiring Quanta to clean up the sites and to take other remedial actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.868" offset="533092">In October, 1981, Quanta filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.396" offset="567260">Those proceedings were converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation in November, and Thomas J. O'Neill was appointed trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.954" offset="605503">Upon his appointment as trustee, Mr. O'Neill undertook an analysis of the property of the estate similar to the procedure outlined by this Court in its decision in Ohio versus Kovaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.544" offset="643851">He obtained appraisals of the property, searches as to judgments and liens, and also estimates of the cleanup costs for the sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.167" offset="678333">It was determined that the cleanup costs would far exceed the value of the property that is in question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.772" offset="704769">It was also determined that because of the liens against the property, even if the property were cleaned up, there would be no value to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.300" offset="734862">Under those circumstances, the trustee had no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.924" offset="749386">He was obligated by the duties of a trustee under the Bankruptcy Code to seek authorization to abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.937" offset="773419">The Bankruptcy Court held that he succeeded in establishing the grounds of burdensome and inconsequential value and granted the application to abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.387" offset="811244">The District Court also upheld that decision, holding that the language of Section 554(a) was very clear, and once the trustee had established the standards of burdensome and inconsequential value, the Court could not look to any additional conditions on the trustee's right to abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.410" offset="883342">That decision, however, was reversed by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.752" offset="900687">Both the Third Circuit and the respondents in this case contend that the right of abandonment pursuant to Section 554(a) is not unconditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.685" offset="944364">They contend that Section 554(a) codified a body of pre-Code law that imposed certain conditions upon the trustee's right of abandonment, and specifically a public safety or public purpose doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.459" offset="1035479">If the bankruptcy judge approves abandonment, does that mean that title... where does title then go?</text>

            <text syncTime="252.398" offset="1159299">There are substantial liens against that property which according to the estimates we obtained exceeded even the fair market value in a clean state.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.333" offset="1190960">The New Jersey property consists of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.677" offset="1200364">The site was leased by the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.785" offset="1208828">There are liens against personal property of the debtor, but that particular site is owned by a third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.358" offset="1399103">The interpretation of Section 554(a) urged by the respondents is wrong, and it is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.806" offset="1440899">First, there is no established body of pre-code law which imposed the conditions on the right of abandonment that they urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.992" offset="1465663">The respondent cites to this Court two isolated cases, the cases of Ottenheimer versus Whittaker and In Re Louis Jones, in which the abandonment power was conditioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.395" offset="1507250">However, two cases, isolated cases, which were never passed upon by this Court do not constitute an established body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.733" offset="1544553">Moreover, both of those cases specifically recognize that at the time abandonment was not a statutory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.323" offset="1578930">Abandonment at that time was only a judge-made rule which had come down to facilitate the administration of bankruptcy states.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.525" offset="1607770">Courts recognized that in weighing the merits of the case, the judge-made rule would have to give in the case of the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.646" offset="1640266">Both of those cases, it is very likely that both of those cases would have been decided differently had there been a statutory right of abandonment at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.624" offset="4844132">I think this Court's analysis in Security Industrial Bank is where one must begin the analysis of Midlantic's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.058" offset="4885928">As the Court well knows, in that case this Court did not reach a constitutional issue by construing the statute in a way that avoided the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.319" offset="4930963">We believe the Third Circuit opinion does raise a constitutional issue of taking by construing 554 in a way that we don't believe Congress intended, and of course that construction was to condition the abandonment power on compliance with state environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.185" offset="5010375">Under Security Industrial Bank, we believe that what the result should be is that 554 should be construed not to be so conditional, and therefore not to raise the taking question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.930" offset="5065337">That is what the Court held in Security Industrial Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.945" offset="5073487">That is what we think has to be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.695" offset="5084459">I think there is another issue that overshadows all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.521" offset="5099714">All of the briefs from, the amicus from the various states, the DEP and the New York Department of Environmental Protection stress environmental concerns, and Midlantic National Bank is not here saying that it is not concerned with the environment, but there is an equal and, I think, just as valid concern with the commercial side of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.090" offset="5198039">It is certainly in the interest of public policy to have commercial lenders lend to companies and lend to companies in environmentally sensitive industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.976" offset="5229595">But if those companies lend to those businesses, and believe they have a security interest and a first priority lien, and that lien is knocked out as per the Third Circuit opinion, I think we are going to find that financial institutions will tread very lightly in this field, and will not lend to these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.953" offset="5305455">I don't think that's what Congress intended by the abandonment power, and I think that is an interest that this Court should be concerned with, just as it is concerned with the environmental aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.762" offset="5348713">Obviously, it is a balancing act, and I think the Bankruptcy Act under 554 did occasion that balance, and the balance came out on the side of the trustee to permit him to abandon, as the trustee's counsel pointed out, in those circumstances where the property is either burdensome or of inconsequential value to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.737" offset="5428648">It did not put any condition on that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.065" offset="5437948">In addition, I believe it should... the Court should be aware that there are other alternatives to the state when they clean up sites like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.309" offset="5494895">The trustee isn't the only pocket here, and as pointed out, I believe, by Judge Davida in the Bankruptcy Court opinion below, the trustee didn't create the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.033" offset="5913794">There is, as I indicated, there is an important consideration here about how the state can go about cleaning up the site other than reaching into the pockets of either the trustee or secured lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.213" offset="5974503">Certainly here there are landlords involved in this site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.665" offset="5996341">The Quanta site in New Jersey was a leasehold interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.366" offset="6011179">The owners of that site are still existing, and own the site, and under New Jersey's environmental laws, they certainly have responsibility for the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.566" offset="6047959">The state and federal government themselves by statute have provided avenues and ways to proceed to clean up these sites, and so there is that avenue to clean up the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.655" offset="6092263">There is also suits that happen now every day against the generators of these wastes on these sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.121" offset="6122147">The generators can be sued or can be coerced into paying for the cleanup of these sites, so that it seems to me to say that the assets of the estate are the only way this site can get cleaned up really does not focus on the true state of affairs in the environmental area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.925" offset="6209396">There is another overriding concern here, I believe, for secured lenders such as Midlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.563" offset="6239907">The thrust of the environmental laws is to place upon private parties initially the burden to clean up the sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.869" offset="6285151">New Jersey happens to be a state where there are a lot of environmentally sensitive industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.711" offset="6308557">Probably there is as much cleanup going on in New Jersey as in any place in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.975" offset="6329559">Certainly these companies, if they are to seek financing for these businesses, must rely upon banks such as Midlantic to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.593" offset="7316047">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, seven years ago Congress codified the power of a trustee in bankruptcy to abandon worthless, burdensome property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.167" offset="7358366">In so doing, the trustee here argues Congress meant to displace not only existing case law, but other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code section of the Judicial Code, and much significant environmental legislation that had been enacted to that time, even though Congress never said so in codifying Section 554(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.128" offset="7434225">Furthermore, as a result, the trustee argues that he has an absolute right to abandon property that can't do the estate any good, whether that property consists of toxic wastes or plutonium rods from a failing nuclear plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.232" offset="7486575">We hope that that view is wrong, and we submit that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.215" offset="7498486">In the time allotted to the states here insofar as some division of responsibility will be helpful to the Court, I am going to address our overview of the case, the abandonment provision, and its relationship to other statutes and case law, and the preemption question, and my co-counsel from New Jersey is going to address the taking question, whether this case is really about priorities and money, and the applicability of the Kovaks case to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.626" offset="7604126">I think it is important at the outset to underscore that the situation before the Court here is a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.795" offset="7632860">This case is not about the $2 million which New York spent to clean up the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.685" offset="7648429">The case in our view is about the bankruptcy's decision to allow abandonment in an emergency situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.257" offset="7874650">In New York City, for example, it amounted to dismissing the guard service, removing the fire suppression equipment.</text>
