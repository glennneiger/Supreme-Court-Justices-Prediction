            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="395356">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.827" offset="410193">In the wake of the devastating Mississippi River Flood of 1927, Congress embarked upon a massive federal program to control flood waters, directing the construction of public works on a massive scale in order to prevent a recurrence of the destruction that accompanied the 1927 flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.022" offset="479052">The statute implementing this program included a comprehensive provision regarding the liability that could be imposed upon the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.193" offset="507682">The provision states</text>
            <text syncTime="95.212" offset="515728">"No liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place. "</text>
            <text syncTime="107.352" offset="564316">The question presented in this case is whether, in light of this provision, which has been codified as Section 702(c) of Title 33, the government has unambiguously waived its sovereign immunity from tort liability for damage caused by the release of flood waters from a flood control project.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.064" offset="639130">Now, this--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="644668">I take it, Mr. Pincus, if it weren't for this provision, there would be little question that it had waived that liability by virtue of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_pincus" startTime="135.955" stopTime="380.177">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="135.955" offset="678732">--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.555" offset="685106">It's the relationship between this provision and the Tort Claims Act that is at issue here, and we think in light of this provision, the Tort Claims Act could not be taken to have unambiguously waived the government's liability in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.148" offset="751457">Indeed, in light of the Tort Claims Act, Respondents have the burden of showing that the liability for which they seek to recover was unambiguously not covered by the provision, because even if the provision was ambiguous, then the Tort Claims Act waiver could not be unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.644" offset="833481">So we think in a way they have quite a difficult burden to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.696" offset="849677">This particular case arises out of two separate incidents in which Respondents suffered damage as a result of the release of flood waters from flood control projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.738" offset="889906">The first incident occurred at the Millwood Reservoir, a project located near Ashdown, Arkansas, designed to control flooding by the Red River.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.943" offset="926686">On June 8, 1979, the reservoir was at flood level, and entrapped flood waters were being released through the reservoir's dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.699" offset="957720">Respondents James and Butler were water skiing on the reservoir, and the current created by the discharge of the flood waters pulled Respondents and Respondent Butler's husband through the dam's gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.638" offset="1001501">Respondents were injured, and Respondent Butler's husband died.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.125" offset="1019369">The District Court found that the government had violated the duty of care imposed by state law by willfully and maliciously failing to warn Respondents of the danger caused by the current caused by the discharge of the flood waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.017" offset="1070987">The Court noted that the current had swept away the buoys that usually marked the area in front of the dam where the current was strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.805" offset="1102125">The District Court entered judgment in favor of the government, however, holding that Section 702(c) barred Respondents' tort actions because Respondents' injuries were caused by flood waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.530" offset="1153011">The second incident at issue here occurred at the Courtableau Drainage Structure, a flood control project located near Opelousas, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.636" offset="1189478">On May 17, 1980, the Bayou Courtableau was at flood level, and the drainage structure's gates were opened so that the bayou would not overflow its banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.177" offset="1231587">Kenneth and Joseph Clardy were fishing in the bayou, and their boat became caught in the current created by the discharge of water from the bayou, through the drainage structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.882" offset="1270458">The boat overturned, and Kenneth Clardy died.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.417" offset="1284564">The District Court in that case granted the government's motion for summary judgment, holding that Respondent Clardy's tort claim was barred by Section 702(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="296.273" offset="1319986">The Court found that Section 702(c) applied because the drainage structures' gates had been opened to prevent flooding, and the diverted waters were flood waters within the meaning of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.712" offset="1361782">The cases were consolidated on appeal, and the panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.366" offset="1384351">The panel stated that prior Fifth Circuit decisions bound it to hold that Section 702(c) barred Respondents' claims, but it indicated that it disagreed with those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.023" offset="1431058">The full Court of Appeals reheard the case en banc and reversed by a vote of nine to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.577" offset="1453210">The Court concluded that Section 702(c) does bar certain tort claims, but that the statutory immunity did not extend to the claims asserted by Respondents in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.166" offset="1495529">The dissenting judges stated that Section 702(c) did bar Respondents' tort claims and argued that the majority's decision was contrary to the statute's claim language, it's legislative history, and settled judicial interpretation of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.562" offset="1565119">We submit that the Court of Appeals unprecedented construction of Section 702(c) is incorrect for two separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.750" offset="1593958">First, the plain language of the statute and the statute's legislative history permit only one conclusion, that Section 702(c) immunizes the United States from tort claims arising cut of damage caused by flood waters such as Respondents' claims here--</text>

            <text syncTime="380.177" offset="1655607">Mr. Pincus, at the time it was enacted, I guess the federal government was not liable for personal injury suits; it was before the Federal Tort Claims Act had been passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.120" offset="1711405">And there is some indication from the language of the full statute and the history that Congress was worried in Section 702 about property damage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.010" offset="1766993">And it certainly didn't speak in the statute in terms of personal injury, did it?</text>

            <text syncTime="413.664" offset="1789563">Well, Your Honor, it didn't specifically refer to personal injury, but it did specifically state, wrote quite broadly, it said no liability of any kind, and it specifically wrote any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.922" offset="1838569">Certainly, if Congress was only concerned about property damage, it could easily have just written in property damage there, and this Court has construed other statutes in which any damage is used to refer to both personal injury and property damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.939" offset="1934699">--Well, Your Honor, we think in light of the broad language of the statute that the question really is whether Congress somehow intended a more limited meaning to be given to the provision, and that in light of this Court's cases, there would have to be a clear indication that that was so in order to read the language narrowly, and the legislative history does have quite a bit of discussion of the injuries that were caused by the 1927 flood and--</text>

            <text syncTime="476.591" offset="2041279">Well, and then you have the concern that even if the language should be read broadly as you suggest, then what is the effect of the subsequent passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.914" offset="2094569">--Well, Your Honor, we... even Respondents don't contend that the Tort Claims Act is an implied repeal of Section 702(c), and we think that the proper result would be to read the statutes together, and that section... that the Tort Claims Act would waive sovereign immunity in the areas not covered by Section 702(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="510.745" offset="2177847">Section 702(c) would be analogous to one of the exceptions contained in the Tort Claims Act, and that area was an area that Congress declined to waive its sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.918" offset="2214627">It is kind of curious, isn't it, that the Congress didn't make this an exception when it was making out its exceptions for the Tort Claims Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="531.408" offset="2260498">Well, Your Honor, we just don't know why Congress might not have done that, but this... it may well be that they knew the statute was on the books and felt it wasn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.199" offset="2307728">There is no indication one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.568" offset="2317236">But certainly there is a list in the Tort Claims Act legislative history of the statutes that the Tort Claims Act was meant to repeal, and this statute is not included among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.007" offset="2350987">And we think, given the high standard that has to be satisfied in order to find an implied repeal, there certainly couldn't be an implied repeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.297" offset="2392051">And we think what Congress was really doing in 1928 was embarking on a new venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.366" offset="2416397">It was a very large construction project, the largest kind of public works project the federal government had ever engaged in, and it was a project involved in an area of considerable danger and hazard, as evidenced by the flood that had just occurred the year before, and we think that 702(c) is really read as an insurance clause, to make sure that whatever happened, the entry of the federal government into this area could not be interpreted by any court or anyone else as waiving any aspect of the government's sovereign immunity except to the limited extent that there were certain exceptions in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.874" offset="2558399">We think Congress just wanted to make very sure that in this expensive and dangerous enterprise there was not going to be any unexpected liability because the cost was already so great that the legislature was concerned that it not be increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.180" offset="3103627">--that 702(c) applies to all statutes, and in fact, there are many other Court of Appeals decisions that do not address the question expressly but that apply 702(c) where it is clear that the project was not authorized under the '28 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.405" offset="3152528">I think, in fact, that most... the vast majority of the Court of Appeals decisions that we cite apply Section 702(c) to statutes not authorized under the... to project, rather, not authorized under the 1928 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.799" offset="3226089">And I just wanted to add one more point in response to your question, Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.770" offset="3246046">In the debate on the '28 act and in the statute itself, it is clear that Congress viewed this as the first step in a larger flood control project.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.626" offset="3281468">There are many references in the legislative history to subsequent projects that would be authorized in the future, and the statute itself contains a provision directing the Army Corps of Engineers to study future projects, including projects to control the flooding on the Red River that the Millwood Dam eventually was built to control, so that it is clear that when Congress enacted the '28 statute, it wasn't just looking at those projects, it was aware that it was establishing a new program and that there would be subsequent statutes in the future authorizing additional projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.382" offset="3428485">In addition to the language in the legislative history which we think clearly supports our position, the settled interpretation of Section 702(c) we submit is an additional reason for this Court to construe the statute in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.228" offset="3507793">Since the first appellate court construed Section 702(c) in the National Manufacturing Company case in 1954, every Court of Appeals has concluded that the statute bars actions against the United States for damage caused by flood waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.138" offset="3567457">And in other contexts, this Court has observed that it is reluctant to overturn a statute's settled, traditional interpretation where there has been unanimity among the Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.434" offset="4164616">Well, they are neutral to the extent that they don't expressly hold either way, but certainly they all read the section as very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.773" offset="4202023">They don't accept... they don't see the tort immunity as flowing out of any concern with property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.379" offset="4228459">They see the tort immunity as an expression of a global congressional concern not to have any liability associated with the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.383" offset="4256463">So I think to that extent they do support our position because they don't... they don't really look at those cases as property cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.537" offset="4281018">They look at them as liability cases, and they conclude that no liability should be imposed on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.095" offset="4327307">In view of the clarity and breadth of the language of the statute, we submit that Respondents really bear the burden of trying to find in the legislative history some narrowing principle that would allow them to assert their claims against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.370" offset="4392404">The Court has stated many times, most recently in the Dimension financial case this term that where the language of the statute is clear, the quest for the meaning of the statute is at an end because it is through the language of the statute that Congress most directly expresses its intent, and here the language of the statute is very clear, and we think that Respondents have to come forward and show clear congressional intent to limit that broad language, and they just haven't done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.373" offset="4504417">Indeed, what is particularly striking about this case is that neither Respondents nor the Court of Appeals have suggested a narrow construction of the statute that is consistent with the language or supported by the legislative history or common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.781" offset="4561991">They have come up with five or different... five or six different interpretations of the statute, but that in itself shows that there is no clear congressional intent as to the one limiting interpretation because the parties trying to limit the statute have simply been unable to agree among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.976" offset="4630849">And at bottom, we think that Respondents and the Court of Appeals simply disagree with the policy determination that underlies the rule of immunity adopted in Section 702(c) and that their narrow constructions of the statute are designed to implement that contrary policy determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.001" offset="4698872">We submit that those are arguments that should be addressed to Congress, and Congress may well decide that it is appropriate to change the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.591" offset="4733249">But in light of the plain language of the statute, that course is not available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.245" offset="4759894">I would just like to address briefly, Justice O'Connor, your concern about the legislative history and property damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.117" offset="4787375">It seems to me that one problem with limiting the statutory immunity to tort... to barring tort liability only when related to property damage, it's difficult to see why Congress... there is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that particular result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.312" offset="4864175">There's nothing that divides tort liability between personal injury and property damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.508" offset="5764982">And secondly, even if 702(c) does bar ordinary tort claims, it is not applicable to the claims of the Respondents because the Respondents' injuries in this case, these cases, arose from the government's mismanagement of recreational activities, totally unrelated to flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.739" offset="5845857">Now, we would like to start out and direct the Court to the second argument there, that is, that if we assume for purposes of argument only here this morning that 702(c) does grant immunity, then even assuming that, it doesn't dispose of the Respondents' claims because the immunity has no applications to the Respondents' damages which were caused by the government's negligence in the management of recreational activities unrelated to flood control.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.304" offset="9032169">When you start analyzing it in terms of traditional tort concepts, I don't see any reason that we should extend immunity to such fundamentally different activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.197" offset="9191725">--They also found that the negligence in failing to maintain the buoys was a proximate cause of the injuries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.303" offset="9228087">We suggest that the appropriate analysis for the Court is to provide that as a question of law, a threshold question would be asked to determine whether or not the government had engaged in activity other than flood control which was a "but for" cause of the Plaintiff's damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.400" offset="9312515">If so, then the case would be tried to the trier of fact on traditional tort principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.656" offset="9345534">This approach, contrary to what the Solicitor argues, would provide the government with a great deal of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.743" offset="9373850">In virtually all of the Court of Appeals cases that have been reported, the result would be the same, and the government has been winning all of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.516" offset="9408959">So I think it is inconsistent to say that, in their brief, that well, we are going to open up this flood gate of claims because with this approach, you wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.889" offset="9450441">You would have the same result in virtually all of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.675" offset="9461622">And additionally, the government would still have the discretionary function exemption available to it under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.131" offset="9499447">Turning to our other point, we believe that 702(c) was clearly intended not to immunize the government against tort claims from which it is already immune, but rather, to deal with special problems created by Congress to compensate certain property owners from flood damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.611" offset="9577396">We know that when you have got any statutory construction, you have got to look at the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.663" offset="9597563">We have already talked about the fact that it was superfluous at the time it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.704" offset="9637687">Secondly, if you say we are going to apply this literal meaning rule in this case, you are going to have to have an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.958" offset="9662765">You are going to have to say we will apply the literal meaning of 702(c) except in the event of constitutional takings because that would render the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.897" offset="9698500">And then the additional reason that we have mentioned, that is, the statute would have had no meaning, the Tort Claims Act is what gave it life, I think we should consider the policy as announced by Congress and the fact that there were... the government had been engaging up until the time of the Tort Claims Act in many activities which presented great risk, but at no time did the government see fit to codify the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.583" offset="9821276">Now, what was significant about this statute is the fact that for the first time, the government was agreeing to compensate property owners along the Mississippi in two situations, for damages that did not rise to the level of a taking; that is the proviso section of 702(c); and 702(d) damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.519" offset="9941021">Now, the way that statute arose, this was the first time that I found where the government ever agreed to pay for anything other than what the Constitution required in these type of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.160" offset="9987519">So Congress was very concerned, and these statutes, the 702(c) proviso and the 702(d) damages, came about as a result of a classic case of congressional compromise, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.253" offset="10043943">On the one hand, you had the very generous provision that the Senate had enacted in Senate Bill 3740 where they said that... it was overly generous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.811" offset="10094203">They were going to just pay for all sorts of property damages, and one of the things that... in addition to the constitutional takings, and additionally, they were going to pay for relocating railroads, and that brought about considerable concern in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.535" offset="10141014">Now, the Senate provision was modified in the House before the debate, so it came to the floor of the House where the actual debate took place, with the Senate's version on the one hand and the administration, the Coolidge administration on the other, which basically said we want to pay for constitutional takings and not a dime more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.051" offset="10227114">So what came about was 702(c) and 702(d), with both sides giving some.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.822" offset="10262223">And 702(c) was enacted as a part of these package of amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.958" offset="10282703">And in those debates there is no... never an expression of concern about tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.064" offset="10319169">The only concern was about claims that might arise under the overly generous provision of the Senate bill where they were concerned about the fact that they were going to be 75 an acre for lands that were only worth $5 an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.964" offset="10418748">That's what all of that congressional debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.983" offset="10426898">Now, they can take a word out of context, or one sentence, but when you read the entire congressional debate between April 17 and about April 24th, it becomes abundantly clear that that was never really considered in those debates; tort liability just didn't come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.228" offset="10503803">The one or two times that it was mentioned was that, well, we know the government is not liable for consequential damages, just very limited mentioning, and then when it was mentioned, it was always with the affirmative statement that we enjoy complete immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.573" offset="10569214">What we believe that 702(c) did was it answered the administration's concern and some concerns in the House that they would not... that the extra damages over and above constitutional takings would be limited to those specific situations described in the 702(c) proviso, that is, the situation where the damages occur on the opposite side of the river from where levies are built if you can't build them on both sides, and then the intentional diversion of the stream in 702(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.632" offset="10725426">And additionally, they were saying that the condemnation provision and procedure set forth in 702(d) would be the only remedy, thereby that was where you would have three Commissioners, and their award would be final, and thereby allaying the fears about all these judicial claims and these local juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.247" offset="10819885">There would be no judicial entitlement or enforcement of 702(c) proviso damages or 702(d) damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.038" offset="10867114">In conclusion, I would call the Court's attention to the statements in the government's brief about the fact that they have over 9,000 of these projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.016" offset="10942974">Now, surely, as they have over 9,000 projects, I think it's clear that they have from the same statistics that are available and known, is that they have visitors in the recreational use of over millions of people to these projects, and I think it's clear and we can assume that... and every time you've got a flood control project, you've got to have a discharge of waters, and that the government has elected I'm sure in most instances to install some type of warning system for any dangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.624" offset="11093439">Now, then, the extreme position that the government urges upon this Court is that it would enjoy total immunity for its failure to maintain those warning systems that it has elected to install, that it would expose all, every citizen that visited this recreational facility under the exclusive control and management of the government to being injured or killed from the government's negligence or worse such as we have in the Butler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.213" offset="11235754">We believe that the Court should reject this contention because it's contrary to the congressionally declared policy as set forth in the Tort Claim Act; it's contrary to the fundamental principles of immunity doctrine that should be limited to its justifying purposes; and it's contrary to the actual congressional intent expressed by Congress in the legislative debates when it enacted 702(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.900" offset="11358529">A few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.535" offset="11377024">First of all, with respect to Respondents' first point, I think the cases that they rely upon in arguing that the statute should be narrowly construed are cases dealing with personal immunity, and the Court has made it quite clear that when the government's sovereign immunity is at issue, precisely the reverse presumption is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.948" offset="11462706">With respect to their argument about recreational versus flood control activities, I think as Justice O'Connor pointed out, it's indisputable that the flood waters caused the damage here, and that the damage would not have occurred without the flood waters, and certainly would not have occurred if the flood control project hadn't been in existence, and we think that that is enough for the... to satisfy the language of the statute which refers to any damage from or by flood waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.635" offset="11573465">Indeed, the release of flood waters that caused the damage here is precisely what Congress would have foreseen as what would happen in the operation of the flood control projects that it was authorizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.177" offset="11639607">And finally, our position also comports with what the Courts of Appeals have decided with respect to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.331" offset="11664267">They have all... the courts that have addressed this question of multiple activities or multiple causation have all stated that the damage must be wholly unrelated to flood control or flood waters in order for Section 702 immunity to be withdrawn, and we think if that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.216" offset="11991738">All I'm saying is if there are two completely independent causes, if the waters are not... if the damage would have been incurred without the presence of the water, we don't assert that Section 702(c) applies, but if the waters are necessary, then we think that's what Congress intended because the statute represents a decision about competing policies, compensating people versus building this vast project, and we think that Congress decided that in order to embark upon the flood control activities, it had to ensure that its sovereign immunity would be complete, and as a result of that, although there may be people like Respondents who are unable to obtain relief in court, there is a flood control system that protects a great many people from damage due to flood waters, and Respondents have other remedies available.</text>
