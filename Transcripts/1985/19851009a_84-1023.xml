            <label>Mr. Patty Merkamp Stemler</label>
            <text syncTime="11.762" offset="193399">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.869" offset="209804">The first question presented in this case is whether the Speedy Trial Act guarantees a defendant a new 30 day preparation period following the return of a superseding indictment that merely corrects a clerical or typographical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.692" offset="265079">The second question is one of remedy and need only be reached if the first question is decided adversely to the government, that is, whether the harmless error rule applies to violations of the defense preparation provision, Section 3161(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="44.373" offset="323803">Respondent is a Mexican national.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.824" offset="337595">On February 18, 1983, an indictment... an indictment returned charged the Respondent in two counts with felony illegal entry and re-entry by a deported alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.086" offset="390676">The felony illegal entry charge required proof of a prior illegal entry conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.051" offset="418575">The indictment alleged that judgment had been entered on that prior conviction on or about December 17, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.220" offset="451176">That date was a typographical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.078" offset="458595">In fact, the prior conviction had occurred on December 7, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.920" offset="482000">Approximately one month after the indictment was returned, Respondent was provided with discovery that disclosed the correct date of the prior conviction, and approximately one month after that a superseding indictment was returned that corrected the typographical error in the original indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.459" offset="552113">In all other respects, the original indictment and the superseding indictment were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.769" offset="573429">At Respondent's arraignment on the superseding indictment, he demanded a 30 day postponement of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.563" offset="600596">He claimed that (c)(2), as construed by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Arkus, guaranteed him a new preparation period after the superseding indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.091" offset="654722">He did not claim that he was either surprised or prejudiced in any way by the correction of the typographical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.712" offset="681158">Rather, he claimed that he needed more time to prepare for trial for two totally unrelated reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.100" offset="706758">One was that he wanted to consult fingerprint expert, and the second was that he wanted to review his immigration file.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.348" offset="731731">Review of the immigration file was needed to defend the re-entry charge in Count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="753569">Rather than postpone trial, the government agreed to dismiss Count 2, the re-entry charge, and Respondent himself obviated the need for a fingerprint expert by stipulating at trial that he was in fact the same person who had been convicted of illegal entry on December 7, 1981.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="169.151" offset="822950">Mrs. Stemler, do you think the case is moot?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patty_merkamp_stemler" startTime="172.133" stopTime="603.945">
            <label>Mr. Patty Merkamp Stemler</label>
            <text syncTime="172.133" offset="834862">Do I think the case is moot?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.055" offset="842595">No, I do not because he has served his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.273" offset="855447">If... no, I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.788" offset="865478">I think under this Court's decisions in Cibron and Karafas, and also under the Ball decision, that the government still has an interest in re-instating Respondent's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.328" offset="919603">If he is ever... if he faces any further prosecutions, the... his criminal record will come into play at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.356" offset="959728">It may influence the sentence that he receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.402" offset="971953">It can also influence parole eligibility, the number of prior convictions he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.805" offset="993582">And therefore, the government has an interest in seeing that the conviction is reinstated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.178" offset="1015003">The District Court denied Respondent's motion for a continuance, holding that (c)(2) did not apply to the superseding indictment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.127" offset="1050843">The Court further found that Respondent would not be prejudiced by proceeding to trial the next day as scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.577" offset="1080622">Respondent as then convicted on the felony illegal entry charge and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.936" offset="1102043">The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction, holding that under Section (c)(2) as construed in another Ninth Circuit decision, United States v. Harris, Respondent had an absolute right to a 30 day preparation period after the superseding indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.225" offset="1171215">The Court further held that the refusal to grant Respondent a 30 day delay of trial was per se reversible error and that no showing of prejudice was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.970" offset="1214160">The decision of the Court of Appeals that the trial must be delayed for 30 days following the return of a superseding indictment is inconsistent with the very purpose of the Speedy Trial Act which is to accelerate criminal trials to protect the public by getting the criminal off the streets as swiftly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.401" offset="1283959">It brings about the undesirable result of mandating delays where no additional preparation time is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.992" offset="1310291">The Speedy Trial Act establishes both minimum and maximum time periods within which trial must commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.522" offset="1336413">For instance, trial must start no later than 70 days after the return of the indictment on the defendant's first court appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.877" offset="1365879">That 70 day period is not measured in consecutive calendar days, but rather it is subject to expansion by periods of excludable delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.921" offset="1398062">One such period is a continuance granted by the judge to serve the ends of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.575" offset="1420632">The Act also contains a minimum time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.760" offset="1433380">That is (c)(2), the defense preparation provision that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.727" offset="1457203">(c)(2) provides that trial shall not commence less than 30 days from the date on which the defendant first appears through counsel or expressly waives counsel and elects to proceed pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.488" offset="1508299">The language of (c)(2) is unambiguous, There is only one first appearance through counsel in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.765" offset="1533377">In this case, that first appearance was on February 18 when Respondent was arraigned on the original indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.841" offset="1557723">His trial did not begin until 59 days later, and therefore he clearly was given 30 days within which to prepare for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.635" offset="1588861">Accordingly, (c)(2) was not violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.446" offset="1608087">The use of the term (c)(2) by Congress manifests Congress' intent to guarantee only a single preparation period of 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.629" offset="1648838">There is nothing in the statute from which... that indicates that Congress intended (c)(2) to give a defendant a second 30 day preparation period after a superseding indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.656" offset="1704949">In fact, whenever Congress did want to give a defendant a second preparation period, to guarantee a defendant a second 30 day preparation period, it did so explicitly as it did in another provision, (d)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="402.556" offset="1756567">In that case, where a defendant obtains... secures a dismissal of the original indictment and thereafter an indictment is returned, the Act specifically states that both the 30 day minimum period and the 70 day maximum start again.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.393" offset="1815917">In contrast, the act is structured so that where a superseding indictment is returned and the original indictment is dismissed on the government's motion, the time limits are calculated with reference to the original indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.702" offset="1865132">Congress, of course, recognized that 30 days would not always be sufficient time for a defendant to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.496" offset="1888328">Therefore, in the Speedy Trial Act there is a second provision that protects a defendant from being rushed to trial before he is ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.321" offset="1915600">That second provision is the ends of justice continuance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.662" offset="1937021">It stops the speedy trial clock, it allows a judge to stop the clock by granting a continuance of whatever length is necessary to accommodate the needs of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.455" offset="1980175">The length of the continuance can be one, as little as one day, and it can be as long as 40 days or 50 days or longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.217" offset="2015179">It is our position that it is this ends of justice continuance provision section of the statute that applies where a superseding indictment is returned, but that is the section that protects a defendant from being rushed on trial before he is ready in light of any changes that have been made in the superseding indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.520" offset="2100443">The decision of the Court of Appeals also conflicts with the legislative history of the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.066" offset="2130640">The theme that pervades the legislative history both in 1974 when the statute was originally enacted, and again in 1979 when it was amended, was the desire of Congress to accelerate criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.997" offset="2186333">Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to protect the public's right to speedy justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.120" offset="2210784">As originally enacted, the statute contained only maximum time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.914" offset="2233981">There was no mandatory minimum preparation period for defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.726" offset="2249236">In 1979 Congress considered amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.348" offset="2267731">It was urged by both the Department of Justice and the defense bar to extend the maximum time limits of the Act, but Congress held fast in its view that the minimum 30 day period... that the 70 day maximum time limit should be retained, that the public's right to a speedy trial had to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.060" offset="2346516">Instead, to ensure that a defendant was not rushed to trial before he was ready, Congress amended the act in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.573" offset="2380580">First, it included (c)(2), the mandatory 30 day preparation period which in our view applies only once in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.648" offset="2408897">It also amended the ends of justice continuance provision to state specifically that a continuance could be granted to accommodate the needs of defense counsel where additional preparation time was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.362" offset="2459783">Both of these amendments were derived from guidelines that had been published earlier that year by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.936" offset="2490085">Significantly, the Second Circuit guidelines did not think it was necessary to guarantee a defendant a 30 day preparation period after a superseding indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.573" offset="2528642">The guidelines acknowledged that not all superseding indictments increase the burdens on defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.268" offset="5431368">By the use of the word "superseding" in front of the term "indictment", the government in reality is asking this Court to allow the government to have control over the defense preparation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.968" offset="5482150">That's not what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.263" offset="5487375">Prior to the mandatory defense preparation period being inserted into the Speedy Trial Act, Congress became convinced that the courts were not capable because of the pressures of the Speedy Trial Act of exercising the necessary discretion to adequately protect the rights of the defendant to be prepared, and that's why we cannot turn the mandatory defense preparation period into a discretionary period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.173" offset="5594999">It's mandatory, it must be read as mandatory, and the fact that the government places an adjective in front of the term "indictment" cannot change the meaning of the word "indictment".</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.177" offset="5719029">The Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference of the United States submitted to the Congress language for the defense preparation period that read something similar to this: Unless the defendant consents in writing to the contrary, trial shall not commence less than 30 days from the date specified in paragraph &lt;one&gt; [= 1].</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.903" offset="5793948">Now, paragraph 1 referred to the 70 day activation provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.040" offset="5830519">But then what Congress did to that, it was, Congress said the defendant really is not in a position to adequately take advantage of the mandatory defense preparation period until counsel comes onto the scene, And that's when they liberalized, they did not restrict, they liberalized the mandatory defense preparation period to say that it begins from the first appearance through counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.719" offset="10917187">The second basic issue that the government raised in its brief and to which we respond is that of harmless error, and in reality, the harmless error argument is again the same argument, just couched in different terms, because if the harmless error concept applies to a mandatory time limit such as the 30 day time limit, then the time limit is gone, in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.582" offset="11024707">And Congress gave a rigid statutory scheme, they created the 30 day defense preparation period because of the demands placed on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.313" offset="11063577">We can't determine the harm that would arise from the failure to comply with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.686" offset="11085102">This Court earlier, in an argument previous to this argument, was concerned about what nonconstitutional error has not had the harmless error standard applied to it, and I would suggest that the statute of limitations provision is a nonconstitutionally based statute that does not provide for its own sanction, that does not provide for any analysis, whether it says whether it is subject to harmless error or not, but it just has not been made subject to the harmless error analysis, and in reality, defense preparation period is a mirror image of that statute of limitations because courts lose jurisdiction after five years or whatever the statute of limitations is in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.793" offset="11265452">And in a sense, what Congress said to the courts is you don't have the authority to try a criminal defendant within 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.377" offset="11507868">The prejudice... and I'll have to speculate, as I did for Justice Marshall... is that the defendant, when the date was changed, lost the defense to the charge, and at that point had no opportunity to go back and re-evaluate his position, had no opportunity to go back and reopen plea negotiations in the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patty Merkamp Stemler</label>
            <text syncTime="3103.099" offset="12558722">Just a few points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.676" offset="12569066">Before responding to the arguments that have been made by Respondent, I would like to address a question that Justice Stevens had asked me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.517" offset="12600413">The case that has found a violation of 3161(j) to be harmless is United States v. Anderton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.593" offset="12636671">It's from the Fifth Circuit, and it's cited on page 41 of our brief, I believe in a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.198" offset="12667078">If I understand the thrust of Respondent's argument, it is that unless you guarantee a defendant 30 days preparation time after a superseding indictment is returned, defendants won't get the time they need because we can't depend on the District Courts to grant continuances to accommodate the actual needs of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.111" offset="12754745">Of course, we've been depending on the District Courts to do that for two centuries, certainly long before 1974 when the Speedy Trial Act was enacted and before 1979 when (c)(2) was put into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.855" offset="12805736">And in any case, wherever a District Court improperly denies a continuance, the defendant has an appellate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.946" offset="12838128">That's exactly what happened to Mr. Guzman to whom Respondent referred, in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.507" offset="12860384">The Second Circuit found that Mr. Guzman should have been given a discretionary continuance after the superseding indictment was returned, and therefore his conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.159" offset="12898941">Therefore, there's no need to construe (c)(2) to apply across the biard to all superseding indictments to mandate delays in every case simply because some judge somewhere might make a mistake on granting a discretionary continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.528" offset="12960485">Respondent also argues that (c)(2), that the predicament that I had discussed in my argument can be eliminated it (c)(2) is considered to be a period of excludable delay where it is triggered after a superseding indictment is returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.288" offset="13023492">There is simply no basis for that argument in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.694" offset="13037076">All the periods of excludable delay are enumerated in subsection (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.707" offset="13057138">They are all put in together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.862" offset="13061736">The 30 day mandatory preparation period is not a period of excludable delay, it doesn't stop the speedy trial clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.891" offset="13085873">The clock continues to run while the defendant gets that first 30 day preparation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.952" offset="13106144">And finally, Respondent suggests that he was prejudiced in this case by the return of the superseding indictment because it deprived him of a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.759" offset="13153373">That's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.524" offset="13160374">The indictment in this case could have been correct... the typographical error could have been corrected by way of amendment, but even if we had gone to trial on the original indictment--</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.284" offset="13387430">So we don't get into any problem with subsection (b) where we return superseding indictments after those 30 days have elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.795" offset="13429540">At worst, had we gone to trial in this case on the original indictment an the proof had shown that the prior conviction was on December 7 rather than December 17, that would have been an immaterial variance, and Respondent could still have been convicted of the felony illegal entry charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.007" offset="13498399">So Respondent was not deprived of a cognizable defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.569" offset="13512609">There is simply nothing in the record that shows that the defendant was prejudiced in any way, and therefore it's completely at odds with the purpose of the Speedy Trial Act to reverse the conviction in this case simply because a needless delay was not given, that the delay was... that the trial was not unnecessarily delayed for 30 days.</text>
