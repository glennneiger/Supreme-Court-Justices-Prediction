            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150039">Mr. Appel, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="brent_r_appel" startTime="72.642" stopTime="486.384">
            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="72.642" offset="440521">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.267" offset="451074">This interesting case raises questions regarding the proper role of the federal court in reviewing the conduct of an attorney who is faced with a client whom he has good cause to believe is about to commit perjury in a state court criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.949" offset="509797">In a nutshell, the Court of Appeals held that admonitions by an attorney violated the right to effective assistance of counsel, the right to testify, and due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.428" offset="551698">I think the best way I can assist the Court this afternoon first is a rendition of the facts, because there are significant constitutional factual issues raised by the record that the Court should be informed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.673" offset="600703">Secondly, I'll dive directly into the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.922" offset="617631">The state's position is that where the only effect of admonition is the exclusion of perjured testimony at trial it is not a basis for habeas corpus reversal of a state court criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.090" offset="662352">Secondly and consistently with the first argument, the state's position is that Strickland v. Washington provides guidance for analyzing the facts in this case, and that: first, the facts reveal no error of counsel that is outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance; and second, even if there were such errors, actual prejudice in the sense of substantial likelihood that the jury verdict would have been affected is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.391" offset="771544">Let's take our voyage through the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.327" offset="783247">Whiteside and two companions in the early morning hours approached Calvin Love's small apartment, where he was sleeping with his girlfriend.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.683" offset="820759">They obtained entry to the apartment and a heated argument occurred over drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.353" offset="843433">Love arose from his bed and was stabbed by Calvin... by the defendant here, Whiteside As a result of the stabbing, Whiteside fled, disposed of the knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.847" offset="885334">But before he could make arrangements to flee to Michigan, he was arrested by police.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.330" offset="911352">Calvin Whiteside died shortly thereafter at the Cedar Rapids Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.922" offset="929637">Whiteside's conflict with the judicial system began almost immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.779" offset="949072">His first appointed attorneys were former prosecutors and, after several session meeting with his attorneys, the attorneys approached the state trial court and moved to withdraw and Whiteside testified he just didn't want these attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.523" offset="1004034">When asked why, he said: Well, they're former prosecutors; I don't feel comfortable with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.786" offset="1025141">At that time he then insisted on the appointment of an attorney by the name of Thomas Cailor.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.113" offset="1046457">The state trial court would not allow that appointment because Cailor's law partner was already representing one of the companions of Whiteside who was present at the scene of the crime, thereby raising a potential issue of multiple representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.311" offset="1103195">Nonetheless, statute insisted he wanted Cailor to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.824" offset="1121272">Finally, Gary Robinson was appointed by the court to represent Whiteside.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.430" offset="1147708">What this fact shows... what this series of facts show is that Whiteside knew how to complain about attorneys and was not shy about expressing those views to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.708" offset="1180831">Robinson immediately began a zealous defense of Whiteside on the charges of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.690" offset="1208730">In the 69 days before trial, he met with his client 23 times or more, and I think the record demonstrates the very effective character of Robinson's representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.639" offset="1252511">At the beginning of his representation, he met with Whiteside in his jail cell and was presented with a written piece of paper that purported to describe the character of transactions that led to White's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.540" offset="1304129">And in that written statement the following words appear:</text>
            <text syncTime="291.587" offset="1316354">"He was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow in bed just prior to the stabbing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="297.350" offset="1339342">And his attorney asked, did you see the gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="301.457" offset="1355851">Did you actually see the gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="303.098" offset="1362330">And the answer was no, but I thought for sure he had a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.643" offset="1372570">It was also revealed that Whiteside had some assistance in preparing the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.844" offset="1393363">Consistently throughout the representation, then, Whiteside said that he did not see a gun, but thought that the deceased did have a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.060" offset="1434219">He though this because Calvin Love had a reputation for being armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.761" offset="1449056">He thought that because the night of th homicide he instructed his girlfriend, in the heat of the argument, to get his piece, which is slang of course for a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.210" offset="1486777">Robinson conducted an independent investigation to determine if a weapon actually existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.567" offset="1508302">He talked to the three eyewitnesses who were on the scene of the crime, and they did not see a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.581" offset="1528259">And there were two police searches, really, of the small apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.064" offset="1542261">The first was what has been characterized as a cursory search, and no doubt it was, several minutes after police arrived on the scene, and they did not find a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.701" offset="1580818">The apartment was then padlocked and about an hour later the police ID team arrived and searched for a weapon and did not find a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.900" offset="1609552">With that, Robinson was convinced that indeed there was no gun, but that the best defense would be that the defendant reasonably thought that Calvin Love while he was in his bed was armed, and that's how the defense proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.130" offset="1662529">But about a week before trial, the defendant, in his own words, "got nervous" about his upcoming defense, and in a question and answer period with his attorney he stated that he saw something metallic in Love's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.905" offset="1725641">And with that, the two lawyers who were present, Robinson and an associate, Donna Paulson, stopped him and said, where did this metallic item come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.355" offset="1763361">You haven't told us anything about that before.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.118" offset="1774437">And, in Whiteside's words... and these are important:</text>
            <text syncTime="408.694" offset="1784782">"In Howard Cooke's case there was a gun. "</text>
            <text syncTime="411.991" offset="1797948">"If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead. "</text>
            <text syncTime="416.145" offset="1814561">With that, his lawyers were shocked and they issued anti-perjury admonitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.175" offset="1834728">Specifically, the admonitions were: number one, it's not necessary to say that you actually saw a gun to have a defense here; you could present the argument you reasonably believed a gun was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.529" offset="1876106">The lawyers said they would not allow perjury in the courts of Iowa and that they would seek to withdraw if he insisted upon presenting perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.011" offset="1905990">If perjured testimony was presented, Robinson told his client he would advise the court of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.243" offset="1930963">And finally... and this is interesting and I'll quote it completely... Robinson told his client:</text>
            <text syncTime="450.695" offset="1952801">"I probably would be allowed to impeach that particular testimony. "</text>
            <text syncTime="455.005" offset="1970042">That's the end of the admonitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.801" offset="1981223">And with that, Robinson instructed his client to think about it, and in the end Whiteside dropped his assertion that there was something metallic on Love's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.061" offset="2026258">And indeed, the question and answer periods in later meetings continued; and Whiteside appeared at his criminal trial and testified fully about the events of that evening and testified why he thought that indeed Calvin Love had a gun, but under questioning did not say that he actually saw the gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.130" offset="2438470">What is the source of this law that you're talking about, the duty of the lawyer, the standard applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="581.080" offset="2474310">We have Iowa law before us, and that was the jurisdiction in which this case arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.777" offset="2525092">They have relevance for the Sixth Amendment question, and the Sixth Amendment question is: Was somehow ineffective assistance of counsel provided here?</text>
            <text syncTime="603.007" offset="2561977">And the way we analyze Sixth Amendment cases I think is presented in Faretta and Herring v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.255" offset="2587055">In Faretta we learned that the Sixth Amendment constitutionalizes in an adversary trial the right to defend oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.753" offset="2612968">And in Herring v. New York, we learned that elements of the adversary system that are universally accepted and traditional are incorporated within that Sixth Amendment, for instance the right for summation at the close of evidence even in a non-jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.200" offset="2666780">I submit to you that the Sixth Amendment here is not so broad as to cover an extraordinary obligation on the part of a defense attorney to conduct himself in an unethical manner and offer perjured testimony in an upcoming criminal trial at the request of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.245" offset="2838979">The Iowa rule once again is that a lawyer shall not knowingly used perjured testimony at trial, and that's similar to the historical traditions of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.554" offset="2876178">And it's clear, the Iowa Supreme Court held indeed, that lawyer Robinson acted in the highest traditions of the legal profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.707" offset="2908779">And it seems to me that because of that long history that's embraced in the Iowa ethical rules, it is indeed an extraordinary proposition and an extension of the right to counsel beyond what has ever been recognized in any of the cases of this court to suggest that the defendant has a right to the unethical assistance of an attorney simply at his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.403" offset="2987564">This Court has never held that, nor would it qualify under Faretta and Herring as being something that's universally accepted as part of the adversary system.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.748" offset="3120997">--That's absolutely correct, and I think the Court of Appeals erred in applying what amounted to a per se approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.371" offset="3147433">The Court of Appeals held that under Cuyler v. Sullivan, which as you recall is that multiple representation case, there was no need to demonstrate any prejudice on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.303" offset="3183169">Number one, that was a misapplication of Cuyler v. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.005" offset="3198006">But I think it's clear that there is no justification for a per se rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.910" offset="3217650">In Cronic v. United States, we describe why per se rules are sometimes applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.938" offset="3245758">First, there are some kinds of situations that are so inherently prejudicial that we know that nine times out of ten or maybe even 99 out of 100 that there's going to be adverse impact at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.668" offset="3292674">And the multiple representation setting is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.714" offset="3304795">Where there are three defendants in the same room and there are multiple crimes, it's almost inevitable that there are going to be conflicting interests, and therefore, under Cuyler v. Sullivan and Holloway, we take a more restrictive approach to prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.879" offset="3361533">The alleged conflict of interest, which I submit to you wasn't a conflict of legally recognized interests at least, is not of the character that it inherently taints the truth-finding process that occurred at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.593" offset="4636308">The record shows that Whiteside, when he was at his post-trial hearing on his motion for a new trial, he relied upon the so-called threat to withdraw.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.789" offset="4725125">Well, plainly, under any of the rules of ethics it's proper, and all the traditions, it's proper for the attorney to withdraw in light of a plan of a client to commit perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.527" offset="6396126">At the discussion between the court and Whiteside over who would be appointed ultimately as his counsel, when Gary Robinson was appointed the court said that, your chances of another change in attorneys is about zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.909" offset="6461641">Okay, that was after the change from his first attorneys and the insistence on Thomas Cailor, who had a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.236" offset="6490898">Finally he got an attorney, and the trial judge looked down and said, your chances of another change in attorney are about zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.718" offset="6512841">Does that mean that the admonitions, when combined... the admonitions of counsel, when combined with this trial court ruling, does that mean that indeed the choice for the defendant was to proceed pro se if Robinson ultimately withdrew?</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.039" offset="6578147">Might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.148" offset="6582535">But what I want to close with is that, where a defendant insists on committing perjury at trial it would be constitutionally proper to require him to proceed pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.877" offset="6625481">There would be no problem with that with an appropriate Faretta-style warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.813" offset="6641259">Of course, that is not right, because, once again, the witness did mount the stand and did testify fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.187" offset="6662783">I think I'll reserve... unless there are further questions, I'll reserve my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.712" offset="6724850">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.084" offset="6758287">I think in light of what was discussed here previously in Mr. Appel's opening statement, it's important to emphasize what was the limited holding of the majority of the Court of Appeals in this case, and that is, whatever counsel's duties may or may not be when their confronted with a client who insists on testifying to what that attorney believes to be false information, that attorney cannot disclose or threaten to disclose to the fact finder his or her disbelief in the client and the fact that the client is lying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.899" offset="6885556">And that's what the attorney threatened to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.272" offset="6895064">That's what puts counsel and the defendant at odds, and that is why the Court of Appeals was correct in applying the presumptive level of prejudice in this particular case, because there was a complete deprivation of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.766" offset="6949086">And that is why this Court should affirm the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.499" offset="6967998">Now, another reason which would allow this Court to affirm--</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.685" offset="6980746">Yes, but the Court of Appeals would put all cases in one bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.869" offset="7017422">It wouldn't make any difference what the evidence was with respect to whether the client was going to tell a falsehood on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.008" offset="7050023">I mean, as the case comes to us I take it the Court of Appeals decided, even if it's perfectly clear and no one would doubt that the client planned to commit perjury, even so the lawyer may not threaten him with anything that would keep him from saying that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.838" offset="7477386">--The reason for that is that the purpose of the attorney-client privilege as set out in this Court's cases... for example, Upjohn and Fisher... indicates that for the defendant to be able to give the lawyer the defendant's version of what happened is necessary for the attorney to be able to advise the client, to develop a strategy of the defense, and to actually intelligently exercise the client's option whether or not to take the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.399" offset="7659616">It's still different from the situation with the witness because having the client... having the attorney-client privilege remain inviolate and having the attorney still give his guiding hand to the client is part of the traditional adversarial system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.324" offset="7783332">In fact, as was brought up in an earlier question, it's clear, and we are not urging and the Eighth Circuit is not urging, that there is certainly not a constitutional right to perjure oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.491" offset="7823979">The question is, however, is what enforcement mechanism is necessary, in light of the impairment on the attorney-client privilege that this would bring out, that is proper to balance both of those interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.814" offset="7877268">But I wonder how much of an impairment there is at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.922" offset="7889703">There are certainly cases from this Court, an opinion of Justice Cardozo's back in the thirties, I think, that said not only is potential criminal conduct not protected by the confidence, but even a scheme to commit fraud is not protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.794" offset="14297121">And you were asking the question about what kind of standards ought to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.496" offset="14307988">And in my view, under the Iowa rules once again, the lawyer has to know about the proposed use of perjured testimony, okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.536" offset="14376116">A reviewing court then in reviewing the lawyer's conduct should use the deferential standards that are in Washington v. Strickland: Did the lawyer's decision to issue the admonitions in that case fall within the broad range of professionally competent counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.953" offset="14429823">And even though I get the drift if this Court that maybe because the second prong of Strickland hasn't been satisfied in this case you may not reach the first question of ineffective assistance, that's the proper approach.</text>
