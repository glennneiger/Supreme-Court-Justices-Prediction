            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="208198">The facts simply stated are these: Ardia McCree on Valentine's Day of 1978, in the course of robbing La Tienda Gift Shop and Service Station, killed Evelyn Roughton, the owner operator, with a shotgun blast to her face.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.150" offset="261697">He was charged with capital felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.869" offset="272563">The state sought the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.721" offset="279982">McCree was tried before a jury which was qualified in accordance with Witherspoon and nine prospective jurors who would not consider the full range of punishments to include the death penalty were removed for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.945" offset="328883">McCree was found guilty and sentenced to life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.147" offset="341736">The conviction was appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court and was affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Steven Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="68.976" offset="425014">It is the state judicial district which comprises two counties, Union County and Ouachita County, population of about 75,000 together.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.666" offset="459809">Post conviction relief was denied to Mr. McCree.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="471617">In 1980 he filed his petition for habeas relief, which leads us to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.570" offset="491365">I'll discuss the issues of impartiality and then cross section as raised by Mr. McCree, but before I undertake to analyze McCree's particular constitutional claims I think it's important that we put this case in its perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.544" offset="539326">This case may be one of the most important criminal cases this Court will consider this term, for if the decision below is affirmed the potential is that some 90 percent of those inmates who comprise death row, numbering 1500, may have to be retried; that in 33 of the 37 states that allow for capital punishment their statutes may have to be changed through special sessions; and that some 3,000 to 5,000 inmates minimally who were charged with capital offenses but got sentences of less than death, either life without or life imprisonment, may potentially be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.682" offset="663878">I believe it's essential for those claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="130.182" offset="669834">General Clark, I would assume that would only be if such a holding were made retroactive.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.419" offset="694807">--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.588" offset="703479">In putting these claims in perspective, McCree's basic complaint is that Witherspoon excludibles were barred from potential membership on the jury that heard the guilt phase of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.577" offset="735453">Factually, those nine prospective jurors were excluded due to the requirements of two entirely neutral and unassailable features of Arkansas state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.266" offset="774219">The first feature is the state of Arkansas has determined that in criminal cases the issue of guilt and innocence should be decided by the same jury, as we believe that the jury acts as a safeguard, if you will, in the criminal justice establishment between the defendant and that establishment: that the policy and the law that require that has been the policy in our state for more than seven decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.695" offset="867842">Secondly, the state of Arkansas naturally decided to exercise its option, when granted by Witherspoon, to prevent any juror from determining sentence who said he would, explicitly vowed, that he would under no circumstances follow state law, which included the penalty of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.407" offset="934715">General Clark, may I inquire about this matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.525" offset="951225">Does it make any difference here that, after the state had excused these jurors for cause under Witherspoon, that it later waived its request for the death penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="214.535" offset="1007231">Your Honor, I don't think that it makes a difference.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="217.451" offset="1018934">Does that leave open for manipulation by the state in a given case an option to excuse jurors under Witherspoon and then plan all along to waive a request for the death penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="236.663" offset="1095734">--Your Honor, I don't think it was the intent of the state to leave open an option to procedurally come back and attempt to bar this effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.397" offset="1118722">The state of Arkansas faces this fact: With some 27 inmates on death row and 146 other persons who were charged with a capital offense but got some lesser offense, the need to determine factually whether the assertions of McCree are constitutional, and what we will be facing if in fact this Court affirms the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.461" offset="1194999">And so in the waiver of that procedure which we waived, and I admit that to this Court, we thought we had a chance to get at the essence of the merits of this issue and get some direction from this Court as to where we should go as a matter of policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.297" offset="1310252">Your Honor, the answer to that question is yes, that in this instance, as with Grigsby in the case that was a companion case, that they were consolidated... and as the Court may be aware, Mr. Grigsby died while he was in prison... that in this instance what we did was we waived this issue because of the fact that, as I said, we wanted to get to the crux of the issue before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.194" offset="1401889">My concern is that is I understand this case the state proceeded initially when it empaneled a jury on the premise that it was going to ask the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.111" offset="1613585">McCree must prove why it is constitutionally impermissible for the state of Arkansas to follow both of these rules at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.015" offset="1637200">He must demonstrate that the Constitution requires that Witherspoon excludibles be eligible for the guilty phase in juries in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.121" offset="1669592">Put differently, I submit to this Court that McCree must show that the Constitution demands that jurors be eligible for the jury who will not follow state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.311" offset="1710343">This Court in Wainwright and Witt stated that the party seeking to exclude jurors for bias has the initial burden of establishing that bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.432" offset="1742839">Clearly, Arkansas did that here when it discovered that those nine prospective jurors explicitly vowed that they would not follow state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.272" offset="1774186">The right to an impartial jury based in the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments can be defined best succinctly, I think, as the right to have one's case decided solely on the basis of the evidence presented and of the instructions of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.913" offset="1832805">McCree's evidence does not even begin to show jury bias within the meaning of this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.567" offset="1855375">It provides no basis whatsoever for concern that the jurors who voted to convict McCree violated their oaths, or that they relied on something other than the evidence presented or the arguments of counsel, or that they disavowed and did not follow the instructions of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.909" offset="1912740">In fact, McCree has presented no attack of any kind on the performance of his jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.897" offset="1932697">The key flaw in McCree's approach is its failure to look at the individual members of his jury who actually decided his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.836" offset="1964462">The only fact that we know about the jurors that were not allowed... that were allowed, excuse me, to serve, is that they stated they were willing to consider the full range of punishments in this case, which included the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.477" offset="2019006">The fact that the jury might possibly impose the death penalty alone if justified does not establish that those jurors in McCree's case are incapable of rendering an impartial verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.201" offset="2065922">To the contrary, there is a presumption of impartiality which attaches to McCree and to McCree's jurors in particular, which arises, one, from the trial court's determination that they were qualified to sit: and two, from their stated oath they would follow state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.273" offset="2942173">But in taking the procedural argument one step further, what McCree does argue, Your Honor, is in fact that the policy in Arkansas is not good policy: We don't like this policy of the unitary jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.715" offset="2983969">That is not the same as, there is a constitutional violation in this process, and it's clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.019" offset="3009151">If Mr. McCree wants the policy changed, his proper forum is the Arkansas legislature in changing that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.006" offset="3033184">But in regard to the procedure, the state interest that we determine that we want to protect first and foremost is that we believe that jury does act as that safeguard in that criminal justice establishment and it is important that the same jury hear guilt and punishment so as not to diminish their responsibility as a juror, so that one juror sitting only in the guilt phase says, I am absolved of all concern and responsibility as to penalty because I am not affected in terms of making that decision, or the reverse if you were the penalty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.275" offset="3146242">And for those reasons, as well as reasons of economy and efficiency, but the first one is that state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.262" offset="3170170">Without conceding the validity of any of McCree's assertions to this Court, as to the mere existence... the issue as to the mere existence of any predilection or notion or concern by defendants in general, without some other objective criteria, is to establish a standard that allows them to be excluded because of their predilection or their notion, allows them to be excluded, is to establish an impossible burden for the state to meet.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.435" offset="3310813">We have said repeatedly throughout this case, and this Court has affirmed, that we have the right in certain instances to exclude certain persons or professions from the jury: lawyers, if you will, doctors in some instances, in Arkansas chiropractors, dentists, dental assistants and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.910" offset="3368701">We have said that that has a legitimate basis in doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.562" offset="3883313">Because in this instance this policy of Arkansas has been if you are a doctor you can be excused, if you are a chiropractor you can be excused, not that you must but you can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.650" offset="3919675">This may in fact then rise to the issue of some sizable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.535" offset="3935244">It may rise to the fact that there's some distinct group, and may show some effort, at least arguably from social science data, as to how they may affect or predict actions on a jury and be excluded for some systematic reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.924" offset="3976831">What I have argued to this Court is that I would ask you to consider sincerely that what the Constitution requires, as I said, is not a particular mix of viewpoints, but in fact a jury made up entirely of persons who can and will evaluate the evidence fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.017" offset="4037226">It would be folly, I submit to this Court, to go beyond that requirement and find a jury bias in every case where the defendant shows that his jurors' attitudes somehow did not perfectly mirror the range of attitudes in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.176" offset="4089785">Concerns of this kind about the relative mix of juror attitudes on issues other than matters to be decided must be recognized under some other constitutional theory, I submit to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.966" offset="4132939">The Court has recognized... the court below, excuse me, the Eighth Circuit recognized, McCree's claim that the exclusion of Witherspoon excludibles violated the constitutional right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.942" offset="4184870">But I submit to this Court, in doing so it seriously distorted the requirements in order to establish a prima facie violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.030" offset="4213187">As this Court has identified, that violation is shown when you identify a group that is distinctive in the community, one that the representation of that group is sizable in relation to the rest of the community, and that they're systematically excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.622" offset="4267626">This Court has never precisely defined cognizability, but it is clear that the Court has never found that attitude alone defined a cognizable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.080" offset="4313393">There's no basis for applying that requirement, I submit, in this cross-sectional representation, where the excluded group shares only one single attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.853" offset="4348501">This Court has held that the basic purpose of the right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is the furthering of that democratic function of the jury, both by placing a democratic body between the defendant and the criminal justice establishment and by also making certain that no segment of society is barred from participating in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.382" offset="4438676">To that end, the requirement protects only those groups that are perceived by themselves and others as distinct in the community, a distinct segment of that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.905" offset="4476710">The exclusion of jurors who share a single attitude, I submit to this Court, does not threaten, does not threaten the democratic function of the jury and thus raise the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.130" offset="4521641">Attitudes, unlike the characteristics that underlie the recognized groups that this Court has identified in cross-sectional cases, are subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.552" offset="4555287">It's been firmly established that the number of Witherspoon excludibles in the population in dwindling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.872" offset="4576603">The facts indicate that Witherspoon excludibles are not a fixed class, that they very in characteristics by which they are identified, and that that variance is subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.163" offset="4621742">The classification of Witherspoon excludibles as a group on the basis of attitude alone is vastly different from those traditional classification characteristics as sex or origin or race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.802" offset="4864368">That threshold point is that the state has a significant interest in Arkansas in utilizing the same jury to make the death penalty decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.276" offset="4914209">It is real predicated on seven decades of belief both in history and tradition and a judgment in terms of policy, of common sense, that juries in our state represent an ability to be that safeguard, that check, if you will, on that criminal justice establishment, and sitting as a jury that they are best able, sitting as the same jury, having to know that they bear the responsibility of adjudicating guilt as well as punishment, that they are best able to make that awesome decision of life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.081" offset="5041478">This Court has recognized that the state has broad discretion in fashioning its own jury selection procedures, and that the state must have some leeway in prescribing the qualifications relevant to jurors and provide a means for reasonably exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.074" offset="5093409">The goal of a fair cross-section is never achieved at the cost of leaving disqualified jurors on a jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel R. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="1261.373" offset="5194555">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.658" offset="5207721">I'd like to begin by saying a few words about the jury selection in Mr. McCree's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.145" offset="5229664">The jury I believe was drawn from Ouachita County only, contrary to General Clark's assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.567" offset="5259339">At the very beginning of the case, the judge read to the jury the information charging Mr. McCree with capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.173" offset="5293821">With that in mind, the judge questioned the jurors about their ability to be fair and impartial in deciding the facts of the case and in rendering the verdict, and none of them had any difficulty with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.898" offset="5340737">After that was completed, the jurors were questioned individually and at length about their ability to consider imposing the death penalty on Mr. McCree if a penalty determination became necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.039" offset="5393295">And at that point eight jurors were excluded solely because they would not consider imposing the death penalty if a penalty determination became necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.078" offset="5433419">They were not questioned any further about their ability to be fair and impartial on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.215" offset="5454003">They were not challenged on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.167" offset="5461736">Nobody expressed any doubts about their ability to be fair and impartial on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.469" offset="5478977">That is the jury that Mr. McCree received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.356" offset="5498516">The jury that Mr. McCree is asking for is not any special jury, not any jury for capital cases, not a jury that consists of the type of people he particularly likes, but an ordinary criminal jury, the same jury that tries 99 percent of criminal cases in Arkansas and throughout the country, the jury that he would have received if the prosecutor in his case had charged him with non-capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.357" offset="5610529">And the question here is what difference does it make that he received a death qualified jury instead of an ordinary criminal jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.565" offset="5647414">Mr. Clark said that we are questioning the policy of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.969" offset="5680955">We are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.587" offset="5691509">We are arguing that the use of this jury, because it is so different from an ordinary criminal jury, violates the Constitution, it violated Mr. McCree's Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury, it violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to a trial on guilt or innocence under the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.934" offset="5772802">Mr. Gross, you used the expression "ordinary jury".</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.719" offset="5783982">I would like to have a little bit better idea of what you mean by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.238" offset="5798088">I understand from General Clark that ex-felons are excluded from Arkansas juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.658" offset="5823793">Now, if the same sort of a survey was run among ex-felons in Arkansas as was run about Witherspoon excludibles' attitudes in this case and it were found that ex-felons were more favorable to the defense than the typical citizen, would you think that gave you a constitutional argument that Arkansas had to include ex-felons on the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.625" offset="5919610">I think Arkansas and the many states that follow the same policy have adequate justification for excluding ex-felons for a number of reasons, including the fact that these people have been adjudged, have been judged by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to have violated serious state laws and as a deprivation of civil rights, as a punishment imposed on them as a consequence of their violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.495" offset="6659084">It's a prophylactic rule, but one that has actual consequences in quite a few cases, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.335" offset="6686461">There will be cases in which the jury would have been just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.886" offset="6704642">In the evidence in this case, there is a study of actual voir dire transcripts is Arkansas capital cases, and that shows that the number of Witherspoon excludibles ranged from zero is some cases to 20 in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.712" offset="6763992">In those cases in which it was zero, then there was no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.344" offset="6862526">The first I've already mentioned, and that is that McCree is not asking for any special procedure in capital cases, but for the same impartial jury that all non-capital defendants receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.754" offset="6912159">The second is that there is no serious disputes about the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.825" offset="6940371">There is no serious question on the exhaustive record that was presented in the district court and on the findings of the district court, which were affirmed by the circuit court, that death qualification produces juries or guilt and innocence that are less representative, less deliberative, and less impartial than ordinary juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.523" offset="7031172">Third, that there is no state interest that justifies or requires this extraordinary procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.034" offset="10773265">In a brief amicus curiae submitted by the Dean of the University of Missouri at Kansas Law School and by a Jackson City prosecutor, they cite a section of a manual prepared by the Missouri Attorney General's office which says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.711" offset="10831989">"In the hands of a prepared state's attorney, the death penalty jury selection process, as in no other type of criminal case, holds the ultimate weapon, the edge for maximum success. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.952" offset="10884965">"The voir dire in death cases gives you, the prosecutor, certain unique opportunities to apply effective tactics which are unavailable in other criminal cases. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.598" offset="10967512">The effect is that the prosecution, by asking for the death penalty, can increase its chances of getting a conviction beyond what they would have been in the same case if the prosecution had not asked that the defendant be executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.238" offset="12350017">But obviously it's of concern to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.357" offset="12358585">The best I can say on that for the Court's information is, a brief was filed on this on behalf of Mr. Woodard which suggests a number of ways in which retroactivity could be limited, and I think it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.284" offset="12414278">Contrary to what General Clark said, I think only a small minority of the people who are on death row now would have relief available to them under this Court's ruling in Wainwright v. Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.324" offset="12458372">I should point out, as the Court very likely knows, that Judge Eisele, the district court judge in this case, already dismissed one petition on this issue because the issue was not preserved in the state courts, and the Eighth Circuit has done that in two other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.482" offset="12515006">Judge Eisele also suggested that the doctrine of Wainwright v. Sykes might prohibit applying this type of relief to defendants who raised the issue but did not present any evidence on it, since it had been identified as a factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.909" offset="12572789">So I suspect the number of people to whom it would apply under existing Court doctrine would be quite small, and it could be limited beyond that, and it could be made non-retroactive entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.913" offset="13008720">McCree's attack is that we just don't like this system, not that it's unconstitutional, we think there's a better way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.860" offset="13084580">In Arkansas, when we qualify a jury in a criminal case we repeatedly... whether it's a drug case, it's a robbery case, it's a theft case, it's a rape case, or it's a death case, we want to know if those jurors can consider the full range of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.134" offset="14257687">The other point I would make to this Court is that there's a division in the legal community among prosecutors as to whether death qualifying a jury makes them conviction prone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.271" offset="14286212">There is evidence in the record from prosecutors in Arkansas that disagree with others as to the effect that qualifying a jury has in terms of their indication of adjudication of a verdict of guilt and innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.312" offset="14330307">And finally, that if the state is not allowed to voir dire on the issue of death, as the question asked, then we are facing a jury that cannot be impartial to the state because of the potential of nullifiers, those very persons who, because of their opinion of the penalty of death, would vote for an adjudication of innocence rather than guilt, even though the state met its burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.825" offset="14408361">For all those reasons, I would ask that the decision below be reversed.</text>
