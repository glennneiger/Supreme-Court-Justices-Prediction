            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="124309">We'll hear arguments next in Randall against Loftsgaarden.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.365" offset="149700">Mr. Brunig, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_brunig" startTime="60.280" stopTime="355.262">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Brunig</label>
            <text syncTime="60.280" offset="365367">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.512" offset="378324">This case presents the issue of whether economic benefits if any which flow from the tax deductions available to a defrauded limited partner are to be deducted from his recovery under the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.331" offset="429628">The case involves two specific questions: do what the Eighth Circuit characterizes as tax benefits constitute income received, as that term is used in Section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933; and secondly, does the actual damage limitation of Section 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandate such deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.528" offset="530356">We would argue that the answer to all of those questions is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.540" offset="546448">I'd like to speak about this briefly in its factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.434" offset="569958">The petitioners here bought limited partnership associates in Alotel Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.468" offset="598170">When they bought it, they bought it based on an offering memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.141" offset="612799">The offering memorandum projected losses for tax purposes in 1973 through 1975 which ranged from slightly above $20,000 to $476, and thereafter taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.274" offset="685315">The taxable income for the entire period through 1991 was estimated to be $96,000, and that these people would be required to pay taxes of over $52,000 during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.122" offset="744769">Instead, they got something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.503" offset="754278">They got certain tax deductions which led to lesser tax payments in the amounts ranging from $29,000 to slightly more than $38,000 per unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.914" offset="807881">The reason that they got greater tax benefits was because B. J. Loftsgaarden, the general partner, created greater losses, either operating losses or greater deductions for other items that were involved, and those were not disclosed, and those were amounts which benefited him either directly or indirectly or benefited his affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.522" offset="930343">There was less income, in addition, because for example the motel could not operate as it was anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.388" offset="965765">Sixty of 159 rooms were not able to be occupied whenever it rained because Mr. Loftsgarden's wholly owned corporation, 2361 Building Corporation, had built a building that leaked through the walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.338" offset="1025638">He of course did not sue himself or the architects, which was a firm of which he was a 30 percent stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.455" offset="1058030">Now, to take that along, we look at that in the statutory context, and this is a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.369" offset="1089690">The first question to be looked at is under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, which provides that any person in a similar circumstance may recover the consideration paid for the security, with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, and it offers an alternative remedy for those who have sold their securities, that is, damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.058" offset="1200449">The Eighth Circuit at a number of points characterized this under Section 12(2) as a damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.042" offset="1232423">It is not, as the Eighth Circuit held in Austin One, a damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.765" offset="1251336">It is an actual rescission case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.778" offset="1259382">There was a tender, and in fact the formula applies: consideration paid, together with interest, less income received.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.403" offset="1293863">The Eighth Circuit held that what is called tax benefits are not a reduction in consideration paid, and that's logical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.429" offset="1333987">If in fact a person bought gasoline for his or her automobile and used it for business purposes, and the price was $10, there would be no reduction in the consideration paid, just as here there was no reduction in the consideration paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.150" offset="1396890">Each partnership unit had the consideration of $35,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.744" offset="1423222">Respondents asked the Court, despite the lack of a counter-petition, to review that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.719" offset="1451120">It should not, both because it's not logical and because it's not appropriately before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.892" offset="1471809">So, the case then goes to, do in fact the reductions in the taxes paid by these individual petitioners constitute income received.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.179" offset="1516949">These tax benefits, as they are called, are not such income received.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.262" offset="1545266">Is it possible, Mr. Brunig, that the tax benefit features of a particular investment might be part of a bargained for exchange, or part of what caused the investors to make the investment in the first instance?</text>

            <text syncTime="373.695" offset="1619036">First of all, the short answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.278" offset="1633351">Every investment involves tax consequences, whether it be one which is characterized as an artificial deduction, or any other deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.635" offset="1678804">Every investment, as we know, has tax consequences and the Internal Revenue Code imposes those tax consequences.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="396.151" offset="1708897">Well, can they have a market value in the mind of the investor such as would affect the damages recoverable in the event such becomes necessary?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Brunig</label>
            <text syncTime="409.659" offset="1762918">Well, every investor, including these, looked on this as an opportunity to recover a profit from the investment and to have certain tax consequences flow from that investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.398" offset="1813805">That's true of every investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.259" offset="1821328">But to look to the benefit of the bargain, respondents would have the Court look only at the income received aspects and say, well, there were tax benefits which flowed from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.468" offset="1874095">The actual bargain is one which would have provided $96,000 in taxable income over a period of time, plus calculable appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.413" offset="1913906">If we are to look at this as a benefit of the bargain case, we should be allowed to recover the entire benefit of our bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.190" offset="1945044">At the time of the investment, that projected stream of income had a valid... and we are not being allowed to recover any of that, and if we were allowed to we would be more than happy to go back and sue for the benefit of the bargain because we'd get much more.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.215" offset="2157158">It has a limitation on a damage remedy provided by Section 28(a) which says you are limited to actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.460" offset="2194147">That term itself is not described, although this Court in opinion prior to the adoption of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934 had considered cases in which actual damages were involved, the L. P. Larson case, for example, and there the Court refused to consider the tax consequences under actual damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Brunig</label>
            <text syncTime="630.734" offset="2647215">What happened was, the trial court said that the result was the same, that there was $35,000 per unit plus interest available to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.782" offset="2695385">The trial court also held that under a benefit... out of an out-of-pocket measure of damages, it would also obtain the same result because in an out-of-pocket measure it would have the price paid, less the value of the security at the date of the discovery of the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.664" offset="2774902">The trial court held that as of the date of the discovery of the fraud the securities were worthless, and because they were worthless you get the same amount back, that is $35,000 per unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.913" offset="2827878">In any event, when we talk about income received, the respondent's expert at the time of the retrial testified that these tax benefits were in fact not income.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.203" offset="2893080">The Internal Revenue Code, both at the time of the adoption of the Securities Act of '33 and the Exchange Act of '34 would not have considered what are characterized as tax benefits to be income received.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.356" offset="2965700">This Court, in United Housing Foundation, considered what we have here, that is, tax deductions which are available to a person and which may create a benefit because of other income which is had, as not being income or profit when locking at the definition of a security as it exists in Section 2 of the Securities Act of 1933, and said it was not income.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.766" offset="3095372">In sum, this is not income received.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.673" offset="3126928">Now, to look at the analysis which the respondents would have the Court adopt, they would say that you look first to Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5, and the limitation imposed by Section 28(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which limits recovery to actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.168" offset="3228910">And they say, that must mean economic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.283" offset="3249390">Then, they would have the Court construe the Securities Exchange Act in pari materia with the Securities Act of 1933, and say, because the standard under the '33 Act is negligence, and scienter is required under the '34 Act, you can't get a greater remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.808" offset="3343535">We believe that that analysis is reversed, and it should go to the express remedy created by Congress in attempting to determine what Congress intended as the measure of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.580" offset="3402572">Clearly, the legislative history says that the person is to get his or her money back, to recover his or her purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.004" offset="3440293">There is no suggestion that tax benefits which are created only by investors' other income, there are no tax benefits but for other income.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.476" offset="3506121">One of the problems that will be created in the future will be one that is demonstrated in Freschi versus Grand Coal Venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.533" offset="3550425">What happens if the individual investor determines that the deductions which are shown on the K-1 do not appear to be appropriate, and doesn't take the deduction on his or her individual income tax return?</text>
            <text syncTime="880.068" offset="3644570">Is he then to be faced with question that he has failed to mitigate his damages by taking deductions which he believed to be fraudulent?</text>
            <text syncTime="888.403" offset="3677902">That will be the issue to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.077" offset="3700577">We believe that Section 28(a) does not impose this kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.061" offset="3716459">What Section 28(a) does is, it says that you can't get identical remedies under state and federal law and have two recoveries for those, and double up your recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.009" offset="3772257">It says that you cannot under the Securities Exchange Act obtain punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.222" offset="3793155">What we have here is a situation in which a promoter claims that he should be allowed to use the federal treasury to support his fraud, and to reduce his damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.784" offset="3867342">As this Court has repeatedly said, the intent of the federal securities laws is to protect the investor, and to deter fraud by a promoter.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.090" offset="4084577">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="995.175" offset="4104952">Tax incentives are provided by Congress to stimulate certain kinds of investment or economic activity, not to subsidize securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.306" offset="4165452">That is basic reason why we submit that the proper approach to this case and to others like it which are in the wings, is to calculate restitutionary relief or other damage awards under the securities laws, wholly without regard to the tax effects of the securities transaction on the various participants, and to leave the further tax consequences after the fraud award to be determined between the Internal Revenue Service and each taxpayer, under principles prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.633" offset="4342771">This approach has the twin virtues of, number one, preserving without diminution both the deterrent and the restitutionary effects of the statutory remedies against securities fraud, and, number two, allowing the tax consequences to be determined by the normal operation of the Internal Revenue Code, and under our annual tax accounting system that will provide for some recapture of revenue by the Treasury by means of the tax benefit rule or other mechanisms, and it will further assure that any remaining tax benefits, after it has all been sorted out, will rest with the persons upon whom Congress conferred those tax benefits rather than being transferred to the perpetrators of securities frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.455" offset="4590098">As this Court knows from its 1983 decision in Hillsboro National Bank, it can be a complex and time consuming task to sort out the tax consequences in such situations, and the results can vary depending on other aspects of the particular taxpayer's circumstances in the taxable years at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.640" offset="4698768">But, that is the method that Congress and the courts have prescribed for applying the Internal Revenue Code to interrelated events that stretch out over more than one taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.459" offset="4750072">The fundamental error of the Court of Appeals in our view, in this case, lies in its attempt through strained interpretation of the statutory terms to improve upon the system that Congress has prescribed by creating an unwieldy amalgam of securities law and tax issues to be resolved up front in the fraud suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.709" offset="4863130">It is a bit like trying to solve an equation containing too many variables without any firm starting point in doing that, and the danger of such a contrivance is that it distorts the results ordained by each statutory scheme and thereby undermines the statutory policies of both Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.615" offset="4962709">The fact that the Eighth Circuit here and the Second Circuit have disagreed on the details of how to create such an amalgam is, in our view, merely symptomatic of the basic error of undertaking that enterprise in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.600" offset="5058631">By both courts, of undertaking to make an amalgamation of the securities issues and the tax issues in the first place in the fraud suit, rather than applying each statute on its own terms and pursuant to its own processes in a straightforward way, seriatim, as the tax law provides and as this Court recognized in the Hanover Shoe case is the proper approach to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.221" offset="5189138">We agree with the petitioner that perhaps the most egregious misinterpretation of this statute is to characterize tax benefits as income of an amount due is a right if the taxpayer has generated other income through his labor or his capital, to get the government to refrain from applying as much tax to that other income as it otherwise would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.213" offset="5325080">But, the tax benefit is not the income itself and it is not the economic activity that generates income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.037" offset="5352456">There would be no economic activity if the only income people had was tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.482" offset="5378160">And so, we believe that that is the fundamental error, rather than of the detailed differences in analysis between the two courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.442" offset="8710027">And I think as a result, compelled in part by the Court's decision in the Norfols and Western Railway case in which the Court decided a few years ago that in determining the earnings of a railwayman killed in an accident for the purpose of awarding his wife his lost earnings, the taxes he would have to pay must be deducted like any other costs of his former life before the net amount was determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.434" offset="8841997">And it seems to me that if the Court is recognizing, as it does, that the payment of a tax liability is a cost to be subtracted from income determining net amount, that it follows that relief from a tax liability is properly regarded as income, at least in an economic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.355" offset="8917648">And I don't want to suggest it's taxable income, but in an economic sense the status of person both before and after he invested in a tax shelter is different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.984" offset="10572244">Part of the deductions were obtained in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.416" offset="10589902">It cost real dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.328" offset="10597530">These people had to make loans to the partnership which they were not allowed to recover by the district court, because the district court held that they had learned of the fraud before making the loan, therefore there was no reliance and therefore no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.249" offset="10657298">So, these people put in money to be used for operating capital which was lost because of the fraud, and that is not and will never be returned, even if we should succeed, and certiorari be used to reverse the decision of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.800" offset="10727411">So, that money is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.719" offset="10735143">These people were required to make those loans to get these deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.402" offset="10753847">It was real money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.914" offset="10759907">It was not artificial deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.505" offset="10770252">To answer the earlier question, would there be some recoupment by the government, certainly the mitigation provisions under Sections 1311 to 1314 allow the government to recoup some of that money, because when the status is changed by a subsequent judicial decision as we've noted in the brief, the government has a mechanism available in addition to the tax benefit.</text>
