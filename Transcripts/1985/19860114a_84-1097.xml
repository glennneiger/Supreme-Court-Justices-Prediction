            <text syncTime="30.144" offset="262079">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.190" offset="270333">This case presents a single constitutional question under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.469" offset="303457">The issue is whether the military services may unconditionally refuse to make any exception or accommodation from their dress codes for enlisted personnel whose religious convictions require them to wear a neat, small, conservative article of clothing that does not interfere with the execution of any military task but that is forbidden by the existing military regulations simply because it is not provided for in the dress code and is different from the uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.016" offset="453609">The petitioner is an individual who was raised as an Orthodox Jew and has during his entire adult life followed the religious obligation incumbent on Jewish males of keeping his head covered at all times during waking hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.554" offset="531767">Although the government in a footnote implies that there is some doubt as to the obligatory nature of this religious duty, it acknowledged in response to our requests for admissions, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="112.408" offset="591222">"that it is a well established religious tradition and practice among adherents to Orthodox Judaism that males keep their heads covered at all times. "</text>

            <text syncTime="135.556" offset="683800">No, he was an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.320" offset="690800">He joined under a program under which he became... he was a psychologist in the Air Force under a program where he was trained and then became a Captain, entered into the Air Force to serve as a psychologist, so he was an officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.360" offset="754957">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.735" offset="756524">I meant officers as well as other personnel in the military services.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="162.137" offset="790066">Mr. Lewin, as long as you are interrupted, may I ask whether it makes any difference in your view if someone enters the service voluntarily, if the person entering the service knows and understands the military is not willing to grant such an exception for dress?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="183.660" stopTime="245.137">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="183.660" offset="876165">We think it really makes no difference, because we think that the decisions of this Court indicate that... Sherbert and Verner and Thomas and Review Board... that government may not condition benefits, for example, such as unemployment compensation benefits, on an unconstitutional condition such as deprivation of religious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.451" offset="955369">The same thing, we submit, holds true if in fact somebody enters knowing that there is such a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.242" offset="990477">Of course, the practical impact, quite frankly, Justice O'Connor, of a decision by this Court saying that the military may apply such a regulation constitutionally would be that it would in the future bar conscientious believers, who would feel that they could not go day to day without covering their heads, from joining the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.749" offset="1084518">We think that's really an additional factor as to why this Court ought not to permit the absolute rule that the military services are arguing for in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="245.137" stopTime="257.038">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="245.137" offset="1122134">Well, Mr. Lewin, you refer to Sherbert against Verner and Thomas versus the Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.183" offset="1142301">But those were cases from civil life.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.806" offset="1152750">We've never applied that sort of balancing test where the military has been involved, have we?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="257.038" stopTime="398.466">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="257.038" offset="1169677">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.398" offset="1171140">That's absolutely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.632" offset="1176051">They were cases from civilian life and the... what makes this case certainly more difficult, and the Solicitor General, I think, concedes in his brief that in civilian life there could probably be no constitutional objection to the wearing of a yarmulke even in courts or other places where one is ordinarily required to dress in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.121" offset="1274062">Military life is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.089" offset="1281899">However, this Court has said time and again that the protections of the Bill of Rights apply in the military, and our view, quite frankly, is that in this case the military has gone far beyond what this Court has even tolerated in those situations where, for example in the parallel area of speech, the Court has upheld military regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.502" offset="1371551">Just to proceed immediately to that point, Justice Rehnquist, Brown and Glines is a case which the Solicitor General relies on very heavily, but of course Brown and Glines which was, I think, the extreme in terms of speech cases where the Court sustained a system of prior restraint in the area of speech as applied to the military, was a case in which a regulation said that material could be prohibited from a military base if it presented, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="339.240" offset="1498506">"a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline or morale of members of the Armed Forces, or material interference with the accomplishment of a military mission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="349.126" offset="1538004">The opinion, Justice Powell's opinion for a majority of the Court, spoke four times of the standard of, quote, "clear danger".</text>
            <text syncTime="358.325" offset="1574889">Clear danger, not simply the possibility of some disruption, not the fact that there might be some interference, but a clear danger to factors such as morale and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.070" offset="1625880">This case doesn't concern a regulation in which the military services are saying any deviation from the dress code that in the view of a commander presents a clear danger to morale, discipline, may be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.377" offset="1691081">This is a case where the military has simply said, absolutely, unequivocally, we will permit not the slightest departure whether it presents a danger or not, from the dress code.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="398.466" stopTime="408.618">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="398.466" offset="1735385">But the military has also said... at least there is testimony... that any departure is in itself a defeat of the military objective which is uniformity of dress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="408.618" stopTime="417.863">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="408.618" offset="1776031">It's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.868" offset="1781047">It is some departure if one assumes that any departure is a clear danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.301" offset="1810722">What we are saying--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="417.863" stopTime="428.813">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="417.863" offset="1813021">That's what the military is saying, is that the purpose of uniforms is to make everybody look alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.143" offset="1834128">They don't want people to look different, and to detract from that is itself a departure from the military scheme.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="428.813" stopTime="480.058">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="428.813" offset="1856802">--Agreed, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.625" offset="1864012">The question is whether a departure in and of itself suffices, or whether the fact that something is a departure suffices to overcome the religious protection that's afforded by the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.168" offset="1914271">And, our position is precisely that just as this Court has said, that departures are not enough, merely departures or disruptions are not enough in the area of speech, departures if they don't... are not so extreme as to present that kind of a danger, cannot be sufficient merely because the military says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.438" offset="1999326">Because, if one relies on what the military says, then, we submit, essentially this Court is saying what it has rejected time and again which is that by entering upon military service someone doffs the protection of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.058" offset="2061811">Where in the military context have we said, as you intimate we have said, that departures are not enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="494.723" offset="2120430">--Well, Your Honor, I think the statements that have been made that say that the Constitution does protect individuals in the military service would itself be undermined if in fact the military could simply by saying so and expressing its expert opinion say that variations undermine morale.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.027" offset="2213635">It would mean that the military... a commander could just as well say prayer is prohibited, private prayer, because that would undermine morale, because people should only obey commanding officers and not pray.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.380" offset="2279045">It wouldn't mean... the military has never taken that sort of a position.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.923" offset="2297226">--We're fortunate that they haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.330" offset="2302869">I'm quite astounded, Justice Rehnquist, that they have taken the position that such small departures as a yarmulke on the top of one's head or even a kum-kum as cited in the brief that they refer to, the dot that a Hindu might wear, very small departures from the uniform, or for that matter, the appendix to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.322" offset="2386879">The government has taken various liberties, I must say, with the record in this case and just put before this Court a host of material which they did not see fit at all to subject to cross examination and trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.772" offset="2432645">One of the extraordinary things is a letter that they print as an appendix to the Solicitor General's brief about what they... at that time was 51 members of a Pentecostal church.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.078" offset="2477889">I'm told now, by speaking to the pastor after I saw a copy of the letter, over 100 members of a Pentecostal church, who were court-martialed or discharged from the Army because they refused to roll up their sleeves, as a matter of piety.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.401" offset="2531179">Now, it seems to me again, Your Honor, that although it is true, the military can say that every order requires obedience irrespective of what a civilian court may say, or what civilian personnel might say, we submit that that's not what the free exercise clause is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.737" offset="2612472">Well, Mr. Lewin, you pressed the point several times that the Constitution follows a person into the military, but not just the way it does for all civilians, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.013" offset="2661582">Lights out at 11:00 o'clock, you can't tell civilians that.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.165" offset="2702229">Let me ask you another... somewhere I read that there is... someone had tabulated 387 different religious sects extant in the state of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.251" offset="6446516">And the question is whether the message that one carries, that the military carries, is that conformity overcomes even very minor deviations, and we submit that, if I can use a historical parallel, this Court in the early pre-war or World War II periods, I think viewed the error, really, of forcing conformity on individuals in the flag salute cases, where again the need for conformity was viewed as overriding everything else, and even the individual rights of those who would not salute the flag, and that error finally was recognized four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.266" offset="6610565">And we submit that very similarly, we have here where Chief Justice Stone dissenting in Gebitis noted that in that case, that involved a small minority entertaining in good faith their religious belief, and that small and helpless minority should not have been overridden in the interests of conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.868" offset="6685066">We submit that with regard to the military needs here, the same is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.998" offset="12513507">If it turns out that Congress makes a mistake and orders the military to make changes in its uniform regulations that do in fact cause disruption, it's quite... it's not easy but it's possible for Congress to correct that mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.929" offset="12585292">If, on the other hand, this Court constitutionalizes mandatory exceptions to the uniform requirements, it's quite a different matter and far more difficult for what might turn out to be a mistake in judgment about the effect on discipline and morale to be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.126" offset="12654046">So, our position is that what's going on here is the political process of civilian... of legislative and executive branch control over the military, working exactly as it's supposed to, and that we would ask the Court to leave the situation where it is and leave it to the branches that are constitutionally in charge of the military rather than to intervene precipitously in an area that this Court has repeatedly recognized, civilian judges simply do not have the expertise to second-guess the military judgments that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.736" offset="12796466">Unless the Court has further questions, nothing else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.106" offset="12837948">If I might just take a minute, Your Honor, on Ms. Oberly's last point, the fact is, of course, that Congress will be affected by whatever this Court says regarding this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="3191.897" offset="12909106">--Yes, and if this Court says there's no constitutional right, at the time this was being discussed in the halls of Congress, military personnel went down to see Senator Hatch and we have reproduced some of that material in that reply brief, the question was, is there a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.766" offset="12980577">Senator Hatch said, although he supported the study, that he hoped this Court would reverse this case, and that's in the Congressional Record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.887" offset="13009102">So that, the Congress is looking... various Congressmen, even if they supported the study, were looking at this Court's action with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.134" offset="13038046">So, simply to say that if this Court affirms what the Court below did, then everything is being put in a neutral position, is totally unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.694" offset="13068348">Congress will take that as an approval of what the military has done, and of its report, even though that report was done precisely in terms... in the context of this piece of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.613" offset="13103979">Finally, let me say that obviously the most difficult part of this case is drawing the line, but drawing lines is what this Court has done time and again in various other constitutional areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.687" offset="13156329">It does it in the speech area with regard to clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.498" offset="13171584">It does it in the speech area and in the press area with regard to obscenity and pornography cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.558" offset="13191751">Difficult lines had to be drawn, but to say that because there's a difficulty of drawing the line, someone who is going to be wearing and is required by a matter of conscientious conviction to be wearing an article of clothing that is neat, that is demonstrated by actual experience, which is Captain Goldman's actual experience over close to four years, and the actual experience of the other doctor who testified in this record, to say that that is something that would interfere with military discipline, we think is just plainly contrary to fact and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.968" offset="13309406">Mr. Lewin, you have suggested that when this Court acts, that we approve... not frequently, but certainly it's not infrequently, that we pass on an Act of Congress, that doesn't mean we approve what they've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.131" offset="13390072">The wisdom of what Congress does is none of our business, and unless a constitutional question arises none of these questions are really relevant.</text>
