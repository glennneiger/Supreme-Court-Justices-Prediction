            <label>Mr. Laurence K. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="13.258" offset="184782">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.908" offset="187395">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the State of California First Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="223444">That Court reversed a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara convicting the respondent in this case, Dante Carlo Ciraolo, of marijuana cultivation, a felony in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.423" offset="281435">This case provides an opportunity for the Court to consider a fourth amendment issue relating to aerial observation which a very important tool used by a number of states as well as the federal government to detect and locate marijuana cultivation throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.651" offset="354369">California contends that warrant is not required for police to see what is knowingly exposed in a yard, fenced or not, to anyone who cares to look from navigable air space.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.394" offset="413302">The facts in this case, Your Honors, are that the police received an anonymous complaint that marijuana could be seen growing in a yard at a home in the city of Santa Clara.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="462412">An officer went by the house on foot, and from the street he saw a rear fence which had bamboo stakes attached to the top of it elevating the fence up to ten feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.843" offset="503163">The officers undertook air observation from an airplane at an altitude of not less than 1,000 feet of ground level, and navigated through air traffic in a flight line with the San Jose, California, airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="560528">Without visual or optical aids, the officers observed in the back yard at 15-by-25-foot marijuana garden which was composed, according to the officers' affidavit, of plants that he described as</text>
            <text syncTime="121.243" offset="616743">"full and approximately eight to ten feet tall. "</text>
            <text syncTime="124.980" offset="631685">The officers from the aircraft took a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.182" offset="648508">They later obtained a search warrant, and they seized a total of 73 cultivated marijuana plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.836" offset="671078">The respondent Ciraolo pled guilty in the trial court after unsuccessfully moving to suppress all the evidence resulting from the aerial observation, and as permitted by California law, he appealed the denial of the motion to suppress to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.762" offset="734817">In reversing that, the appellate court held that the aerial observation was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, and the California Supreme Court denied a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.384" offset="773269">The ultimate issue in this case is, as in the companion case, Dow, whether Ciraolo had an expectation of privacy against aerial observation of his garden that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.579" offset="838053">Our position in this case is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.281" offset="852890">When a person's property is concealed from public view, then the fact of its possession is private, but if property is in public view, it is in no sense private, and hence it is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.659" offset="926346">Ciraolo's garden, whatever else one can say about it, was knowingly exposed to the scrutiny, the observation, the identification, if you will, of literally anyone in aircraft above or around his property.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.268" offset="3604838">Sure, the exploitation of technology into the home can be threatening and invokes Fourth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.874" offset="3635244">I think that brings up, Your Honor, what I understand to be Ciraolo's core contention in this case, and that is that the statement in Oliver that the distinction between open fields and curtilage implies that the curtilage warrants the Fourth Amendment protections that attach to the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.252" offset="3712776">That was the statement that I believe was made in the lead opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.740" offset="3730748">I think what Ciraolo is asking this Court to do is to read that statement as meaning that the distinction between curtilage and the open field implies that the level of expectations in the home attached to the curtilage.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.079" offset="3876093">It seems to me that in order to know what protections attach to the curtilage, one has to know what level of protection attaches to the home, but for this Court that is not a new question.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.136" offset="3928338">That was answered in Katz, and it seems to me that Katz controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.707" offset="3950595">The statement was, around which this case seems to revolve like the moon around the earth is what a person knowingly exposes to the public even in his own home or office is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.300" offset="4004929">But what he seeks to preserve as private even in an area accessible to the public may be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.454" offset="4029589">Now, to my mind that doesn't take a lawyer to figure out what the court was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.025" offset="4055816">I mean, it responds to something that we all understand and know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.105" offset="4136168">But if the public can see it by virtue of where you placed it, it doesn't matter if it was in your home or in your yard, and it doesn't matter that you hoped it would be secret from government, because you disclosed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.333" offset="4205132">There is no privacy interest advanced protecting from observation what was entirely visible to everyone, including the officer who could have acted as a private citizen and observed the very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.159" offset="4264377">I think if that contention is accepted in this case, then all of Ciraolo's other arguments as far as fences acting as roofs or being a badge of expectation, as far as the focus argument that I can expect police to look at my yard routinely but I don't expect them to look at it when they have reasonable suspicion, all the rest of those arguments just seem to me to fall by the wayside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.987" offset="5395688">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there is a word that hasn't been mentioned much today, and that is the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.695" offset="5438529">The warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment is what we think is extremely and most significant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.484" offset="5477713">There are very good reasons for requiring a warrant, and I don't need to repeat them here because this Court has repeated them in Katz and in Comera and in Karo, and we all know what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.810" offset="5531003">Now, there are exceptions to the warrant requirement, and they show that privacy or security in our society is never 100 percent pure or 100 percent secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.539" offset="5605922">There is always the possibility, no matter how private and intimate an area is, that smoke will be discovered, and the fire department will come in, despite your protestations that this is Fourth Amendment sacred ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.567" offset="5674049">There is always the possibility that there will be an accidental entry, that the police acting legitimately make a mistake as to the address and come into your home and your privacy is invaded, and anything that is seen in plain view during that invasion is subject to admission in a criminal court, because it is in plain view while the police are acting properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.670" offset="5794422">A friend can breach your trust and tell the police everything that you said in confidence, and there will be an occasionally air traveler who can look down into your back yard, no matter how private you would like it to be with your swimming pool and your other private activities in your back yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.583" offset="5874043">There will be an occasional air traveler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.718" offset="5886582">Why does that deprive Mr. Ciraolo of privacy any more than these other exceptions to the warrant clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.141" offset="5920332">Why does that excuse the police from taking the perfectly reasonable step of taking their anonymous tip and what other information they could gather by appropriate police work and presenting it to a magistrate and getting appropriate authority to invade the privacy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.923" offset="6019493">If they didn't have probable cause on the facts that are in this record, they could have investigated more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.577" offset="6046033">They could have determined if Ciraolo was perhaps named in another police report with regard to marijuana cultivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.635" offset="6082291">They could have done innumerable things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.351" offset="6093158">Instead, the police decided that they were going to be the magistrate and they were going to authorize a search of Mr. Ciraolo's curtilage, his back yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.375" offset="6133282">I think that kind of a focused aerial invasion of this protected area is much different than a casual overflight on which the State of California relies in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.843" offset="6347173">Something intimately connected with the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.731" offset="6366712">They use the outdoor area in the same way that they use the indoor area when they are fortunate enough to have one, and they have their right to privacy in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.753" offset="6402761">I would not distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.253" offset="6408717">I would agree with Justice Powell in the Oliver case that there really is no distinction between the privacies of the home and the privacies of the back yard, the intimate area of the home, unless you give up that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.179" offset="6468485">If you don't build a fence and you let your neighbors look in, then you have waived the right of privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.506" offset="6629817">There is a limited to what the curtilage is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.673" offset="6638490">What that limit is, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.756" offset="6646745">I would say that if you look at Blackstone, you look at the common law aspect, where this whole idea of curtilage developed, and it had another name in the common law, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.266" offset="6700870">It is called the homestall, which is something I discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.968" offset="6715604">But anyway, that means that it is connected in some way with the living areas of the home, and if it is totally devoted to agricultural pursuits, it doesn't seem to me quite the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.174" offset="6760430">I would say that if there is a barn, if there is a house used for purposes of the main house, you could have that as the curtilage, but it is impossible to give an exact definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.083" offset="6816123">I want to get back to the focused aerial surveillance here, because I think that focus is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.853" offset="6843186">This was not a casual overflight, Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.872" offset="6855202">This was an intense look at someone's particular back yard, someone as to whom evidence of criminal activity was already present in the minds of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.913" offset="6903372">This was a situation where a warrant was certainly possible to obtain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.808" offset="6979022">Yes, I think our position would be a little different because that kind of a situation raises the same issue that Justice White dealt with in the Camera case, that it is impossible to be specific as to probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment, so I have suggested that under those circumstances where there is routine aerial surveillance of back yards on an intense basis that is going to take place, that the administrative warrant solution would seem to be ideal, and could be adopted on the same basis that this Court adopted such a solution in the Camera case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.443" offset="9525543">Putting up a ladder probably allows you to verify what is there much better and it doesn't intrude on everybody else's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.449" offset="9557517">At least when you put up a ladder, you only see Mr. Ciraolo's back yard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.388" offset="9593357">The problem is to the government I imagine that it appears to be more snoopy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.007" offset="9611747">It appears to be dirty business, as Justice Holmes condemned in the Olmstead case, because you are snooping, and somehow to elevate the police at a 1,000-foot level is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.182" offset="9664515">Now, 1,000 feet is about ten times the width of this chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.551" offset="9681964">It is really not that high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.253" offset="9688756">It is less than a quarter of a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.353" offset="9697115">I see no difference between that and the ladder situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.657" offset="9714356">In the Carroll case the government said, of course, that their privacy invasion was only a little one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.529" offset="9753853">It was only putting the beeper in someone's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.881" offset="9763257">But Justice White pointed out that if the government had sent in the FBI to check to see whether the chemicals were present, that would, of course, be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, so it is similarly a violation of the Fourth Amendment when they obtain the same information by sending in a beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.259" offset="9836818">And here they obtained the same information not by the ladder which they agree is condemned, but by sending up the airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.632" offset="9870255">I think that the idea that Mr. Ciraolo has waived his right to be free of a focused aerial surveillance made for that specific purpose of gathering criminal evidence is unnecessary for good police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.142" offset="9932322">Ciraolo didn't open his privacy up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.677" offset="9942457">The police are trying to open it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.112" offset="9952175">They are trying to insert a can opener and open it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.230" offset="9964714">They are trying to say that it doesn't matter what our purpose is because some stray airplane might have flown over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.729" offset="10474624">Just very briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.581" offset="10482043">I do agree with one thing that Mr. Krause does say in this case, and that is that Fourth Amendment cases are decided by reality and not hypotheticals, but what he keeps talking about seems to be some distinction between intense looking and non-intense looking, and routine and focusing, and for the life of me I don't understand those arguments, because... I mean I know what air patrol involves, and air patrol involves focusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.283" offset="10600848">You don't look at the whole world from an airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.416" offset="10609416">You look at something specific, and you go from place to place looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.754" offset="10622790">That is what air patrol is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.404" offset="10629373">So, in terms of focusing, I just don't understand what the practical difference Mr. Krause is speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.324" offset="10653093">The only other thing I wanted to say is, the tenor or the sound that I get from the respondent in this case is that there is something really oppressive and egregious and perhaps subjective but nonetheless there, and I know the Court doesn't like to listen to quotes, but to get the flavor of this case, the fellow's name involved in this is Officer Schutz, Detective John Schutz, and he was the only witness at the suppression hearing, and this is the officer as he makes... describing his intensive scrutinizing, his focus.</text>
