            <text syncTime="52.283" offset="363114">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.753" offset="380982">The question in this case, in essence, is whether the Customs Services routine administration of its civil forfeiture responsibilities violates the constitutional rights of persons whose property has been lawfully seized for violating the customs laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.096" offset="442317">Specifically, the issue concerns the effects, if any, of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment on the administrative consideration of a petition for remission or mitigation that is filed in connection with a seizure for civil forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="501772">Here, for failure to declare an automobile to customs upon entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.176" offset="526641">Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1618, an individual who has an item seized for forfeiture, even if the item is unquestionably bought, may file petition for remission or mitigation with the Secretary of the Treasury, seeking to have all of part of the forfeiture remitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.387" offset="595499">The Secretary has set up certain internal procedures for processing these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.891" offset="617547">In the ordinary course the Agency will consider and rule on the petition, giving its ruling to the Claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.612" offset="644401">If the Secretary determines that remission is appropriate and the claimant agrees to the terms of the proposed remission, the matter is settled without a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.253" offset="687032">Ninety-five percent of remission petitions filed in car seizure cases are settled in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.574" offset="712319">If there is no agreement on remission, either because the Secretary determines that remission is not appropriate or because the claimant is unsatisfied with the terms upon which remission is offered, then the case proceeds to a judicial, or for small cases, an administrative proceeding in which the forfeitability of the item is determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.035" offset="790164">Mr. Horowitz, is the remission proceeding basically used as a statutory authorization to customs people to just settle these cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.878" offset="841468">Is that what it boils down to, they have settlement authority, in effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="177.116" offset="862471">I guess in some ways it's used that way, although they're not the prosecuting authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.401" offset="879607">It's an agency thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.593" offset="940316">Yes, I would agree as a practical matter, that's basically how it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.545" offset="952123">The reason I hesitate to agree completely is, it is possible to get remission even after the forfeiture proceeding has occurred, in which case there would no longer be a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.900" offset="989530">It would surely be a matter of executive grace there.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.685" offset="1000711">But, naturally the government is more reluctant to grant remission under those circumstances and therefore it's to the advantage of claimants to have their remission petitions decided on by the Agency before there's been a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.910" offset="1053583">The background facts may be briefly stated as follows: On January 20th, 1975, Respondent attempted to bring across the Canadian border into the United States a new Jaguar that he had purchased in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.920" offset="1109694">When asked at the U.S. Customs station whether he had anything to declare, he failed to declare the car and it was then seized as forfeitable under 19 U.S.C. 1497.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.376" offset="1151490">Respondent then completed, with the assistance of the Customs agent on duty there, a brief handwritten petition for remission in which he stated that he had no intention to avoid customs duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.083" offset="1194330">The Customs agent then helped Respondent arrange transportation to a local hotel where he stayed overnight, and from there he arranged to get home in his private plane that was waiting for him in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.724" offset="1240828">Two weeks later Customs returned Respondent's car upon his posting of a bond for the value of the car, assessed at $24,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.830" offset="1277295">On February 12th, 1975, approximately two weeks later, Respondent's counsel filed a more detailed supplement to his remission petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.186" offset="1314703">This was prepared by an attorney for the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.006" offset="1329958">Thirteen days after the filing of that supplemental petition, now 36 days from the date of the original seizure, Customs acted on the remission petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.445" offset="1367783">It informed Respondent that... excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.356" offset="3867388">It is our contention that the Court of Appeals erred in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.193" offset="3882748">First and foremost, we submit that there is no constitutionally protected property interests at stake in the remission stage, and hence there to which due process rights can attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.616" offset="3924440">Second, even if there is such a right, we submit that the course of events here could not conceivably have violated due process, and third, even if it did violate due process, we would contend that the remedy here, which is returning the $3,600 to him, basically eliminating the forfeiture, is quite inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.327" offset="3995284">The primary question here, the one on which I will focus, is do the protections of the due process clause which apply to deprivations of life, liberty or property attach to the remission procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.968" offset="4037811">Another way of putting the question is, does the remission procedure here... that is, does an adverse decision to the Claimant in the remission proceeding deprive him of any property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.924" offset="4081697">We submit that the answer is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.312" offset="4095176">Of course, there is no question that the Respondent does have a property interest in this car at the time it was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.715" offset="4120881">That property interest cannot be taken away without a judicial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.250" offset="4138957">That judicial hearing is what gives him due process with respect to that property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.271" offset="4163094">But, the property interest in his car simply has nothing to do with the remission proceeding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.927" offset="4197681">The remission proceeding is collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.729" offset="4208861">It assumes that the property was lawfully seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.414" offset="4219623">It assumes that the property is forfeitable, and the question of the remission proceeding is whether the government will give to the Claimant either executive clemency or, as an act of settling, to avoid litigation whether it will give back some of this property, property that really belongs to the government, whether it will give some of it back to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.708" offset="4288796">That decision does not deprive the Respondent or the Claimant of any property interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.864" offset="4421393">Congress could repeal the remission procedure tomorrow and there would be no question that the forfeiture, general forfeiture procedure would still satisfy due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.035" offset="4458069">I think maybe the best way to look at this problem is to assume that Customs had set up the remission procedure a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.808" offset="4489207">As we've explained, the remission proceedings come first the way it is set up now, and that is done to avoid litigation, but Customs could just as easily have said that the forfeiture proceeding will be held first, and let's assume that the held a forfeiture hearing the day after Respondent's car was seized and the car was held to be forfeitable, and then Customs said, now that your car has been held forfeitable you can file a remission petition and we'll decide whether we're going to remit some of the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.459" offset="4595787">In that situation there can't be any conceivable argument that there's a property interest, or that any due process right would attach to the remission petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.828" offset="6433240">I think the first question you asked, Mr. Chief Justice, puts the case in the proper framework, when you asked counsel whether or not the government has to justify forfeiture, the government can make its forfeiture simply by administrative fiat or having seized the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.857" offset="6501367">That does not constitute a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.492" offset="6511921">There is no forfeiture merely because there has been a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.396" offset="6531565">There is no finding of guilt and there is no finding of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.848" offset="6553403">The only way that there is a forfeiture is not by the government acting unilaterally, but by a judicial proceeding which the government is required to bring, the government must initiate that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.274" offset="6615052">And I would respectfully submit to the Court that as terrible as the facts may be, and my law professor said argue the law if the facts are against you, they really are not your concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.296" offset="6655176">The question posed by the Ninth Circuit, and at issue before the Court, are the procedural safeguards that are involved when there is a seizure of property with no hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.479" offset="14523885">I'm not sure, but I think that doesn't have anything to do really with the due process question here, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.983" offset="14541961">There's just no independent right in remission proceedings to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.552" offset="14564218">I'd like to talk if I have a minute about this rich versus poor thing, because it's not only a rich person like Mr. Von Neumann who could bring this really ridiculous lawsuit, it's the poor people who have their items seized who really don't have an interest in the Ninth Circuit's decisions here because those are the people who need for Customs to decide these remission petitions and to give them back the property, most of the property they've had seized, and it's just not in their interest to have people at the Customs Service looking over their shoulder at what is likely to be an invalidation of the forfeiture by the Ninth Circuit sometime down the road and acting on these petitions hastily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.810" offset="14705174">Now, we don't say in our brief that we'll give these petitions short shrift or that we'll deny them all if we lose this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.178" offset="14726699">We do say that the due process clause... the Constitution doesn't prevent us from doing that and certainly in borderline cases, in cases where the Customs Service doesn't have the opportunity to investigate, they're going to be put in a position where they act on these things more quickly and less favorably to the claimants if they're concerned about 36 days being too long for them to hold on to one of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.175" offset="14810709">So, I do think there is an interest the claimants have in this case, but it's not the interest that is taken into account by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
