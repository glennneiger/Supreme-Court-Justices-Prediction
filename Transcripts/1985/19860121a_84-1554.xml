            <text syncTime="68.817" offset="411719">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents two questions the resolution of which will have a profound effect on habeas corpus litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.890" offset="463964">The first question is whether attorney error resulting or flowing from inadvertence or ignorance but not rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes cause under Sykes to excuse a procedural defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.040" offset="536584">The second question is whether habeas corpus relief can be obtained from the federal courts by asserting attorney error was caused when that very same form of cause is recognized in the form of ineffective assistance of counsel by a state court, and the petitioner has never presented any suggestion of ineffectiveness to the state court to determine whether that court may excuse the default and address the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="662077">I realize the Court is familiar with the facts, but there are a few facts I want to mention and emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.664" offset="691125">Prior to Carrier's trial, 1977, for the offense of rape and abduction, and again during the trial, his defense attorney moved for discovery of the victim's statement made to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.502" offset="742429">The prosecutor took the position that the statement is not favorable to you, so you are not entitled to receive it, but I am entirely willing to have the state trial judge consider it in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.919" offset="792166">Judge Lamb was then assigned to hear the case, and he considered it in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.120" offset="812960">At the request of the defense attorney he compared that statement with the preliminary hearing testimony of the victim, looking specifically for inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.975" offset="856323">But there was a second trial judge who considered the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.209" offset="873251">Judge Lamb was replaced by Judge Owen.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.833" offset="887775">When the discovery request was renewed at trial, Judge Owen reviewed it in camera, and before he ruled on the discovery request, he listened to the direct examination testimony of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.605" offset="950886">After hearing that, he denied the request, finding the evidence was not favorable or exculpatory to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.666" offset="979099">The next factual point I want to mention, he defaulted on appeal in the sense that he did not raise a discovery claim on direct appeal although he had assigned it among many other errors in his notice of appeal filed in trial court, but he did not pursue that on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.847" offset="1051824">About one year after the direct appeal review was completed... when I say one year later, I am including the denial of certiorari by this Court... Carrier filed a pro se habeas corpus petition in the state court, but he waited almost one full year.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.684" offset="1119220">He alleged his discovery claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.105" offset="1132908">The commonwealth moved to dismiss that petition, saying that habeas corpus is not substitute for direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.476" offset="1166344">You could have asserted your claim on direct appeal and did not, but we didn't leave it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.114" offset="1184944">We said you are foreclosed from having it considered on habeas corpus under Virginia law in the absence of additional allegations explaining the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.250" offset="1237397">Carrier proffered none.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.624" offset="1246906">After the state habeas proceedings were completed, including the appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for the reasons stated in the commonwealth's motion to dismiss--</text>

            <text syncTime="350.942" offset="1540209">The first issue, as attorney error is caused, the commonwealth is not suggesting that if an egregious trial error is omitted by defense counsel such that a miscarriage of justice might result or would result, or that a fair trial would be denied, that relief should not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.166" offset="1629130">Of course it should be granted and it would be granted by showing ineffective assistance of counsel for not pursuing that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.133" offset="1656924">If you can't show your attorney was ineffective for admitting the claim, surely the claim is not sufficient to establish a denial of a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.166" offset="2089094">I think a good example of this might be the Stokes case, which we cite in our opening brief, where the Supreme Court of Virginia found that an attorney was ineffective for not raising a Sandstrom defective instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.256" offset="2145414">Now, that doesn't mean you don't look at his performance overall.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.161" offset="2157117">In this context, on appeal, surely the Court would look to what issues he did raise, the relevant merit, so it really wouldn't be in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.766" offset="2195464">You don't ignore what else was done, but the focus would be on the particular deficiency as it would be in any allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.184" offset="2233185">But the standard... I mentioned the Stokes case, and why I think this is so significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.791" offset="2259621">The Stokes case, where the Virginia Supreme Court found the attorney was ineffective, would have been wholly bypassed, that is, the state courts would have been wholly bypassed in that situation under the Carrier rule of the Fourth Circuit if prisoner Stokes had elected to go directly to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.673" offset="2343109">All he would have had to do was go to the District Court, allege his defective instruction, and assert as cause that he had attorney error.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.606" offset="2386890">Under the Fourth Circuit's rule, there would be no requirement to exhaust state remedies because it is only a cause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.167" offset="2417087">The state court would have been bypassed, would have had no opportunity to address that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.026" offset="3024591">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as I was saying at the luncheon break, even if this Court accepts our position on the exhaustive question, and we fervently hope the Court will, acceptance of the Fourth Circuit's rule will put enormous pressure on the state courts to lower their standards, to accept mere attorney error and inadvertence as an excuse for serious procedural defaults or face the alternative of simply deferring the federal court without providing the federal court the benefit of either state factual findings or the benefit of the state court's reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.948" offset="3184251">Surely this Court would not accept on a routine basis attorney error or inadvertence as an excuse for such defaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.053" offset="3232630">And I submit the state court should not be required to do that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.192" offset="3249244">The role of the Fourth Circuit's rule in practical application is going to cause less significant issues to occupy the attention of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.607" offset="3310893">And it will undercut the very healthy role of the state default rules of motivating counsel to emphasize the important issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.509" offset="3358436">There are a number of serious problems with the Fourth Circuit's role, among them the very unfair distinctions that it draws.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.943" offset="3396261">First, if you object... I mean, if the object is fairness, if that is the purpose, the Fourth Circuit rule just doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.283" offset="3433564">Why have a special test that if the attorney doesn't object to something, he omits the objections, then we will excuse that on the basis of attorney error, but if he doesn't call an alibi witness, which can be even more prejudicial to the defendant, he has to show ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.977" offset="3508379">The Strickland standard would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.568" offset="4002720">The other difficulties with the Fourth Circuit's task is the fact that this Court has recognized in numerous decisions without any question that a defendant is bound by the tactical decisions of his lawyer, yet the defendant under the Fourth Circuit's approach who has the attentive lawyer is bound, whereas the defendant who has the inattentive lawyer would not be bound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.445" offset="4150260">As I said, the evidence was overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.240" offset="4161440">The defendant was positively identified by the victim, positively identified by an independent witness, a Mr. Barko, who observed the two together shortly before the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.986" offset="4204385">The victim was... there is a positive identification by this third witness of both the victim and the perpetrator when he saw them together.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.806" offset="4295709">So I won't go into all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.274" offset="4305531">There was evidence of blood typing that matched the defendant and put him in a 20 to 30 percent population grouping, so the evidence was truly overwhelming in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.143" offset="4352970">The Fourth Circuit's approach trivializes the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.218" offset="4389332">Most federal circuits, I think, recognize that because they have rejected that approach, and not a single federal circuit has accepted the Fourth Circuit's rule since Engel versus Isaac was decided, and that is really for good reason, because the Strickland test is not going to result in any denial of due process, but acceptance of the Fourth Circuit's rule is going to afford the defendant undue process.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="1359.847" offset="5575814">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin by describing what our position is with respect to attorney oversights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.078" offset="5620744">Our position is not that attorney oversight can under some circumstances be cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.217" offset="5641329">Our position is that if the defendant is alleging attorney error as a basis for relief, he must satisfy the Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.102" offset="5692842">The cause and prejudice test, we believe, applies to something external to the defense, something, an outside circumstance that has justified the defendant's failure to raise or preserve his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.737" offset="5755432">Now, this does not mean, contrary to the suggestion that I think the ACLU and respondent have made that nothing can be cause under the cause and prejudice test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.826" offset="5787719">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.358" offset="5797855">First of all, there are situations where the court may refuse to allow a motion or objection to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.074" offset="5824709">The state may have a rule which unreasonably conditions or interferes with the ability to make or preserve a claim, or in the more common situation there will be an inability to discover through reasonable diligence the factual or legal basis for the claim at the time when the rules call for it to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.862" offset="5907882">Now, an example of that is the United States against Henry, a Messiah case this Court decided a few years ago in which the Messiah claim was raised for the first time in collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.921" offset="5952082">We did not argue there that there was a procedural default in failing to raise at a trial, because the fact that the cellmate was a government informant was unknown prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.057" offset="5996699">Now, so our position is that in order to get relief on the basis of a claim which was procedurally defaulted at trial or on appeal on the basis of attorney error the defendant must satisfy the Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.346" offset="6077783">Now, what are the alternatives to this position?</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.017" offset="6088545">One alternative was the view expressed in Fay against Noia and in Justice Brennan's dissent in Wainwright against Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.874" offset="6115922">And that is that a procedural default should bar a claim only if the defendant is somehow personally responsible for it, and this view is based on the notion that it is not fair to hold the client responsible for the errors of his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.070" offset="6180705">Now, under this view, procedural defaults would rarely be enforced, but I think there is little question that this view was rejected by the Court in Wainwright and again rejected in Engel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.705" offset="6227308">Now, what has happened in this case is a search for an intermediate position by the Court of Appeals, and under this position as I understand it the client's personal waiver is not required, but he is still not to be bound by his lawyer's action unless in effect the lawyer deliberately waived the right by choosing not to raise an issue of which the lawyer was aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.618" offset="6326886">Now, it seems to me there are several reasons for rejecting this effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.662" offset="6355099">First of all, I think it is quite clear that this can't be squared with Engel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.408" offset="6382057">There is language in Engel versus Isaacs that unequivocally talks about the lawyer overlooking a claim, the lawyer's unawareness of the claim, and makes it quite clear that that is not cause to excuse a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.245" offset="6449453">Now, there is another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.401" offset="6466067">I am not sure that I totally understand what the Fourth Circuit's test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.634" offset="6479024">It seems to me clear in this case that what happened is that the lawyer in his assignment of error listed everything he could think of, and then when he got around to preparing the petition for appeal, selected from among those things the issues that were thought most likely to gain the attention of the Virginia Supreme Court, discarding others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.922" offset="6564078">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals here reversed, and in fact it suggested that almost surely this was the kind of attorney error that would constitute cause, but it did send it back for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.994" offset="6616428">Now, what is the situation in the case where the attorney considers he is aware of the potential existence of a claim but decides that it is not sufficiently meritorious to be pressed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.895" offset="6668046">Is that under the Fourth Circuit's test going to be a waiver of the claim, or is it not going to be a waiver of the claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.454" offset="6698243">Now, if that is going to be an excusable default in that case where a legal error causes the lawyer to choose not to press a claim, then we will be back essentially to Fay against Noia, and the cause and prejudice standard of Wainwright will be pretty much wiped out in any case where the lawyer has failed to preserve the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.664" offset="6791135">I don't think the Fourth Circuit meant to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.257" offset="6809420">I think what the Fourth Circuit meant to say was, well, if the lawyer doesn't realize the claim exists, that is cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.613" offset="6846932">If the lawyer realizes the claim exists but chooses through a legal mistake not to press it, that is not cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.733" offset="6875353">Now, in our mind this creates a totally irrational system for deciding what constitutes cause and what doesn't constitute cause, and in thinking about it I have come up with a little parable to try to illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.057" offset="6932718">Long ago there was a kingdom in which the king liked to hold cooking contests, and every week he would have a contest, and in this particular week he decided to have an apple pie baking contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.490" offset="6990397">And all the nobility participated, and there were two noblemen who sent their cooks out to make apple pies and submitted a pie to the contest, and they were denied any award in the contest because there were no apples in the pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.453" offset="7042224">The king said, sorry, no apples in the pie, you can't get any prize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.529" offset="7062599">Well, this was a litigious country, and they filed suit, claiming that they were entitled to this prize, and they each brought in their cooks, and one cook said, I didn't realize there weren't any apple trees in the garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.460" offset="7126233">It is true, there was one there, but I just didn't realize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.865" offset="7139922">And the other cook said, I knew there was an apple tree, and I went out there, but I didn't think my ladder was tall enough to reach the apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.533" offset="7182553">Now, under the Fourth Circuit's result, one of those noblemen is entitled to the prize and one of them is not, because in one case the cook was unaware there was an apple tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.592" offset="7218811">In the other case, the cook wrongly thought he couldn't reach the apple tree with his ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.919" offset="7236157">Now, to come back to our defendants here, what difference does it make to the defendant, what difference does it make to an equitable resolution of this problem whether the lawyer failed to recognize that there was a claim or recognizing that there was a claim erroneously failed to recognize that the claim had legal merit?</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.659" offset="7327063">It seems to me this is a completely unworkable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.955" offset="7340229">Now, it is not only unworkable, but I think it totally undermines what the Court accomplished in Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.514" offset="7374501">Strickland is really... can fairly be viewed also as a procedural default case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.966" offset="7392264">The claim in Strickland was, my lawyer failed to put on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.542" offset="7418596">I would like another hearing at which evidence that tends to be exculpatory or minimize my culpability and justifies a lighter sentence can be put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.911" offset="7460078">The state's answer to that essentially is, no, you have failed through the exercise of due diligence to put on evidence that was available to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.220" offset="7497277">You have defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.533" offset="7502606">You don't have the right to come back and have another hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.610" offset="7510860">Now, it seems to me that essentially the claim in Strickland is not different in character from the claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.668" offset="7547118">In both instances, there is a failing by the lawyer, a default or a claim of default by the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.603" offset="7578883">Again, in Strickland, the Court labored, pondered the question, and decided that the way to deal with these feelings Yes?</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.232" offset="8333404">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue before this Court is really quite a narrow one, the meaning of the word "cause" under the Wainwright versus Sykes doctrine, and it is really narrower than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.817" offset="8423683">Justice O'Connor referred to the key issue in this case in her question in the first few moments of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.718" offset="8463285">The Fourth Circuit's decision is really much narrower than either the Commonwealth or the Solicitor General would make it out to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.948" offset="8508215">The issue that was stated by the Fourth Circuit, and this is on Page 8 of the appendix, the precise issue to be resolved in this case is whether Carrier's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel can make out Wainwright cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.143" offset="8597032">What we have here is not a question of mere error, mere negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.327" offset="8625766">What we have here is the Fourth Circuit, read in context of the issue, read in context of its discussion of this issue, holding that the performance part of Strickland, holding that the incompetency argument that was made by Carrier would have to be used as the standard to see whether this one default, this single glitch met the performance standard that Strickland lays down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.262" offset="8805489">This can be seen in the Fourth Circuit's opinion in the appendix at the bottom of Page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.446" offset="8838194">After reviewing a series of cases, the Fourth Circuit said, from these authorities we conclude that attorney error short of wholesale ineffectiveness of counsel can constitute Wainwright cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.908" offset="8904023">Now, I would like to posit and emphasize that word "wholesale", that under the Sixth Amendment, we are looking, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to the overall performance in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.652" offset="8967030">Here, the Fourth Circuit said we are looking at the one default to see whether it met the performance test of Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.242" offset="9009453">The Court goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.819" offset="9019693">A procedural default is excused not when counsel reasonably but incorrectly exercised his judgment, but when through ignorance or oversight he fails to exercise it at all in dereliction of the duty to represent her client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.640" offset="9086984">This is what we mean by attorney error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.404" offset="9098060">I suggest that the Fourth Circuit in trying to find the midground to which Mr. Frey referred found a very narrow one that preserves the concept of cause under Wainwright versus Sykes as applied to attorney conduct or misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.975" offset="9328356">Secondly, we have the assertion that it was through the ineffective assistance of counsel, and that there was no consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.347" offset="9365868">Putting those three points together, I suggest that the lower court could reasonably determine that it wanted to note more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.634" offset="9779020">You are looking for counsel exercise of the minimum skill being counsel, and as the Fourth Circuit says, we aren't here to second guess judgments made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.105" offset="10076816">On the other hand, if there is any other explanation, I don't know what it would be, because I don't know.</text>
