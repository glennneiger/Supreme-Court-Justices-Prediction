            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140996">We will arguments first this morning in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby.</text>
            <text offset="140996">Mr. Branson, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_j_branson" startTime="3.785" stopTime="183.020">
            <label>Mr. David J. Branson</label>
            <text syncTime="3.785" offset="156043">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="6.570" offset="167223">This case requires the Court to again consider the proper applications of the standards enunciated 21 years ago in New York Times v. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.728" offset="215811">In that case this Courtl held that a jury verdict could not be sustained because that libeled plaintiff did not produce clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.435" offset="262727">In Time, Inc. v. Pape, this Court applied the clear and convincing standard in reviewing a defendant's motion for a directed verdict under Rule 50 of th Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and in Bose v. Consumers Union, this Court applied the clear and convincing standard in reviewing... in a de novo review of a district court determination under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.151" offset="357499">The question today is whether the trial courts must apply the clear and convincing standard in public figure libel cases on a defendant's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="416849">The Petitioners urge this Court to hold that indeed the trial courts are required to apply the clear and convincing standard on a defendant's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, and therefore we urge this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.004" offset="481006">The purpose of Rule 56 has been often stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.989" offset="492918">it is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to determine whether there is a genuine need for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.062" offset="529176">The commentators are in agreement that the evidentiary standard for both motions is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.167" offset="561567">They agree that there is no genuine need for a trial if it is clear in summary judgment that the trial court would have to grant a directed verdict applying the proper evidentiary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.427" offset="614648">The Court of Appeals in this case disagreed, and the Court of Appeals here set a rule that permits a public figure libel plaintiff to proceed to trial and indeed to complete its case at trial even though it cannot on summary judgment produce clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.924" offset="704614">And the Court of Appeals gave three reasons for setting this rule, and I would like to discuss each one seriatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.612" offset="739409">The first reason given by the Court of Appeals was that a trial court should not engage in a weighing of the evidence on a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.468" offset="774831">The answer to that reason is that a trial court need not do that on a motion for summary judgment, and indeed, the trial court performs no different function on that motion than the trial court performs in evaluating the evidence on a motion for a directed verdict, and since it is clear that the trial court must apply the clear and convincing standard on a motion for a directed verdict, there is no reason that it can't equally apply it on a motion for summary judgment.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="183.020" stopTime="190.006">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="183.020" offset="873052">But when a motion for a directed verdict is made, the evidence is all in the record, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_j_branson" startTime="190.006" stopTime="196.227">
            <label>Mr. David J. Branson</label>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="900950">The evidence is all in the record that the plaintiff wishes to put before the court at that time, that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.910" offset="920594">And that leads to the second reason--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="196.227" stopTime="201.314">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="196.227" offset="925819">The plaintiff will have inevitably put his evidence all in at that stage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_j_branson" startTime="201.314" stopTime="466.532">
            <label>Mr. David J. Branson</label>
            <text syncTime="201.314" offset="946194">--That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.547" offset="951105">And that is the reason the Court of Appeals identified as its second reason for not applying the clear and convincing standard on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.520" offset="982975">The Court of Appeals said that this motion is really at a threshold in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.091" offset="1009306">It's the beginning, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.609" offset="1019337">The Court of Appeals said that it would be unfair to make a plaintiff marshal all of its evidence at that state of the litigation, and indeed would turn, the Court of Appeals said, a motion for summary judgment into a time consuming and expensive process if plaintiffs had to marshal all of their evidence at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.320" offset="1090181">But an examination of the facts in this record demonstrates that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.122" offset="1109407">This case was filed in September 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.442" offset="1134694">At the first status conference the trial judge set a date in August 1982 as the cutoff for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.696" offset="1159772">The plaintiffs, Respondents here, took their first deposition in October 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.184" offset="1189656">The defendants did not file the motion for summary judgment until August of 1982, almost a year after the first deposition was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.939" offset="1220689">In the interim, the Respondents had served document demands and interrogatory requests which were duly responded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.545" offset="1251096">On filing the motion for summary judgment by the defendants, the plaintiffs moved the district court for additional time to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.382" offset="1282443">They asked until October 15, 1982 to take additional discovery, and the district court granted that motion and gave the Respondent until October 15 to complete discovery, and indeed, the last deposition was taken by the Respondents on October 14, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.477" offset="1350883">Therefore, we were not at a threshold stage of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.147" offset="1369483">Disocvery had closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.513" offset="1375020">The Respondents had fully utilized the Federal Rules of Discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.032" offset="1389022">They had made the record then that they wished to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.401" offset="1398531">There was never a complaint to the district court or to the Court of Appeals that the Respondents had in any way been denied an opportunity to develop the record further--</text>
            <text syncTime="325.025" offset="1441058">Far from being a threshold, we had completed the preparation of the record, and indeed, it would have ben within the discretion of the district court had it denied our motion for summary judgment, to have ordered the parties to trial immediately without any further discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.469" offset="1506782">So it cannot be sound policy to take a case like this, or indeed, any case, and tell a libel plaintiff or any plaintiff that they are entitled to go cast a motion for summary judgment on the notion that we are just at a midpoint in the litigation and that after that point is past, they will develop new and additional evidence that might support their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.365" offset="1586403">And that is the justification, the principal justification utilized by the Court of Appeals to support its rule, and we believe it's fundamentally wrong, both on this record and as a matter of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.856" offset="1636349">The third reason offered by the Court of Appeals to support its view was that it recited the dicta of this Court that state of mind does not readily lend itself to summary disposition in any kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.782" offset="1696118">Our response to that is threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.484" offset="1706880">First, this Court has never accepted from Rule 56 any class of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.323" offset="1742198">Second, whether or not state of mind or any other evidentiary issue might present itself in a given case does not determine the standard of proof that any plaintiff must meet at any stage of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.517" offset="1803011">Whether the standard is preponderance, both at the summary judgment stage or at the directed verdict stage, the burden of the plaintiff is to produce that sufficient evidence to go beyond that motion, and it does not do to say that, well, there is a type of evidence here that excuses me from my burden, whatever it is, in this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.913" offset="1884617">And that's what the Court of Appeals has essentially said, that because state of mind is at issue in public figure libel cases, we must lower the standard that the plaintiff is required to meet on a directed verdict and not require that standard to be met at summary judgment, but that by definition simply ensures that cases will go to trial on which the district court must grant a directed verdict when the plaintiff has completed his case, and that is wasteful use of judicial resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.532" offset="2007079">What about credibility questions where there's just a straight conflict between two sets of affidavits on a question of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="475.471" offset="2042815">Your Honor, when that happens, whether it happens at summary judgment or whether a credibility question arises at trial, in the plaintiff's case, the duty of the district court is to draw the inferences in favor of the person opposing the motion, and therefore that result ought to be the same on either motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.638" offset="2679471">The Court of Appeals dealt with Mr. Eringer on two different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.257" offset="2697966">One of them relates to the procedural question that I've already addressed, the threshold issue, and the other dealt with the substantive question of actual malice and the evidence in the record of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.482" offset="2742896">The Court of Appeals said that Mr. Eringer is not in the United States and therefore is not available for deposition, and since the Court of Appeals said that this is a threshold inquiry, we should give the plaintiff an additional opportunity to somehow deal with Mr. Eringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.925" offset="2808620">Now, of course, we believe that that's fundamentally in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.777" offset="2820010">The Federal Rules of Discovery do not stop at the borders of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.811" offset="2836206">If the plaintiffs had wanted to depose Mr. Eringer, there was a procedure to do it, notwithstanding the fact that he is resident in the United Kingdom, and they never suggested to the district court they had any desire to depose Mr. Eringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.155" offset="2889600">So the threshold reason for using Mr Eringer as a reason for denying summary judgment here we don't believe is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.011" offset="2920947">On the merits, the Court of Appeals used language that makes it clear that their analysis of the Bermant who was the author of this article, and Eringer, who was the source for these six articles, is an analysis based on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.335" offset="2978312">Indeed, the Court of Appeals uses the words "standard of care", and that is the language or negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.174" offset="3005688">The Court of Appeals says that Mr. Bermant did not lock Mr. Eringer in the eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.844" offset="3032333">He couldn't therefore have reliably, reasonably assessed his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.482" offset="3050828">That's the language of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.148" offset="3057515">And finally, the Court of Appeals said Mr. Bermant did not check Mr. Eringer's sources himself, and a failure to investigate, we have been told time and again by this Court and others, is the language of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.758" offset="3111954">So the Court of Appeals has said that this issue must go to a jury because the plaintiffs have put in facts, specific facts, Mr. Bermant did not check his sources, Mr. Eringer's sources, that give raise to an inference only of negligence, and that's constitutionally insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.303" offset="3190113">But it is admissible evidence on the question of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.273" offset="3205995">And so by adopting the rationale of the Court of Appeals and diminishing the standard that the plaintiff has to meet on summary judgment, the plaintiff now has some evidence that is admissible on the question of actual malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.165" offset="3253643">It's not sufficient, and this court would have to find on a Bose review, if a judgment was entered on this evidence, that it was not constitutionally sufficient, and therefore reverse the judgment, but this plaintiff gets to go to trial because they have evidence of mere negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.844" offset="3648300">We have suggested in our brief, Your Honor, this.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.630" offset="3659481">If the footnote in Hutchinson, which of course has been repeated by this Court in Calder, suggests that there is a rule against summary judgment in public figure libel cases then that ought to be reconsidered in the Bose, light of the Bose determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.008" offset="3728967">However, we believe that the proper reading of the rule... not of the rule, of the dicta announced in the Hutchinson footnote is that it calls for a neutral application of the summary rules, and indeed, they should be neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.752" offset="3783928">And we can make that point in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.952" offset="3792705">First, when this Court first enunciated that dicta in Poller and stated that state of mind does not readily lend itself to summary judgment, many of the lower courts began to state that there was a rule against summary judgment in antitrust cases where state of mind was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.514" offset="3875043">And therefore this Court in National... First National Bank of Arizona versus Cities Service, set the record clear and said there is no such rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.721" offset="3915794">The facts of each particular case, the Court said, in Cities Service, must be examined so that we can determine whether a trial is needed, and the Court there upheld a grant of summary judgment in an antitrust conspiracy case, making the point to the lower courts that there is no rule against granting summary judgment in the right case.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.218" offset="3993848">Now, before the Hutchinson footnote, lower courts had been saying there is a rule favoring summary judgment in public figure libel cases, and we believe that the Chief Justice in the footnote in Hutchinson simply corrected that view by stating there is no rule, and we believe that what the Court said in Cities Service applies to this kind of a case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.016" offset="4093009">Each case must be dealt with on its own facts, and where a libel plaintiff in response to a motion for summary judgment can produce specific facts on which an inference can be properly drawn that there is clear and convincing evidence of actual malice, they are entitled to go past the motion and to get to the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.903" offset="6496588">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,--</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.371" offset="6518426">A reading of the Petitioner's brief and reply brief asserts in essence that the Respondents called for the abolition of all summary judgment in public figure libel cases because of considerations mandated by New York Times, that is, the question of the mental processes of the author and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.720" offset="6603794">That does not represent our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.853" offset="6612363">We support the position here taken by the Court of Appeals which did grant... did agree with the district court that in 21 of the allegations of defamation it was appropriate to grant summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.813" offset="6668160">We agree with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.764" offset="6675997">We also agree with the Court of Appeals that in the nine where they did... where the Court of Appeals did not agree with the district court, that the Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.037" offset="6713091">All summary judgment cases and libel cases... summary judgment motions in libel cases need not be denied because of questions of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.095" offset="6757290">For example, the court held in this case, the district court held, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that there were some allegations which were basically opinion, which is, of course, protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.751" offset="6799922">They held that there were reliable sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.903" offset="6808594">They held that some material had been previously published in a responsible and reputable publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.640" offset="6831478">We do not quarrel with any of those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.608" offset="6843389">But when we come to that which is left, we get to the question of weighing the evidence and determining the credibility of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.197" offset="6877767">For example, Mr. Branson has discussed many of the reasons given by the Court of Appeals for holding that Mr. Eringer is not a source who can be considered reliable on a motion for summary judgment, except Mr. Branson left out what I consider to be the single most important argument offered by the Court of Appeals, and that is Mr. Anderson, the publisher of the defendant, testified at the deposition, when asked if Mr. Eringer was reliable, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.251" offset="7009946">I don't care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.185" offset="7013708">It doesn't matter whether he's reliable or not; he's not a source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.089" offset="7029277">But he turned out to be the sole and exclusive source for five of the defamatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.143" offset="7053518">So that it seems to us that the standard mandated by New York Times, talking thereafter, in its progeny, about reckless disregard, are spelled out by the defendant stating I don't care; I don't... it makes no difference to me whether he's reliable, and then relying upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.355" offset="7130318">This Court in St. Amant talked about the apocryphal telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.675" offset="7151634">The Court of Appeals has said in this case this is something like the apocryphal telephone call coming into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.162" offset="7181623">But the other matters are even stronger in terms, I believe, in terms of a need for a trial, the matters which Mr. Branson did not discuss, for example--</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.824" offset="7248287">--That is true, but also we would go further and say that the clear and convincing standard should not be applied here at this level, and the difference, if I may say, Your Honor, between a directed verdict and summary judgment, it's not the amount of time the plaintiff has to conduct discovery, it is the difference between cross examination in the presence of the person or the trier of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.072" offset="7341283">That is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.305" offset="7346194">As Wigmore has said, and as this Court has quoted with approval, the greatest engine ever discovered for the determination of truth is cross examination, and that does not contemplate cross examination in a desert, but cross examination before the trier of the facts, or at least before the court to make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.599" offset="7403350">As the Court has said in Bose, which is a case cited by the Petitioners in this case, the Court has said in Bose it is true there can be a determination, but this Court said in Bose that is because the entire record is there, no discovery, not affidavits, the record is there, and the demeanor of the witnesses, the crucial witnesses, was observed by the Court, and that is what is lacking here, no matter how long the discovery period is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.752" offset="7931964">That is correct, but at least the appellate court has the advantage of the view of the jury or/and the view of the trial court in reaching its conclusion, something totally absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.310" offset="7982224">We have heard that this is a two-stage, a two-trial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.797" offset="8004167">First we... plaintiffs must try the case before the judge, convince the court, but what do we have to convince the court on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.819" offset="8036245">We have to convince the court, according to this theory, as not only what is in the mind of the witness, the publisher, the author of the defamation, and whether, how his mind was affected by malice or lack of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.996" offset="8096954">But according to this standard, the court must then guess as to what the jury, not yet chosen, would guess as to what the witness who has never been seen, but more than that is that the whole process... it is not a two-trial system, it is a no-trial system once that motion for summary judgment is granted, because no one who has made a determination has seen a record, and no one has seen the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.980" offset="8204892">One other area where the Court of Appeals acted and said the matter should be tried was in reference to... and this is slightly complicated but I think extremely important... a man named Mr. Spear and a man named Mr. Trento, while working for Jack Anderson wrote, and it was published in True Magazine, a totally defamatory article about the plaintiff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.762" offset="8299977">The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against True Magazine and its publisher, Fawcett, named Spear and Trento as well, but did not serve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.117" offset="8337385">The True Magazine, Fawcett Publishers, then settled that case according to the demands of the plaintiff, paying them a substantial sum of money, and publishing an entirely compensatory article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.846" offset="8400287">Subsequent to that, Mr. Spear became an editor of the defendant publication, The Investigator, took and utilized that in assisting the person who wrote the article, Mr. Bermant, gave him the exact information which had been published previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.256" offset="8461936">Mr. Bermant then secured a copy of True Magazine which contained such defamation that True itself had settled the case to the favor of the plaintiff, and republished the same defamation yet again in The Investigator, and some of those allegations of defamation, previously published defamatory material, survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.204" offset="8561724">And those are some of the matters the Court of Appeals said should be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.590" offset="8575308">This is in essence, I believe, a classic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.894" offset="8588474">Of course, it is possible to conjure up with a fertile imagination a case, if this one is to be dismissed on summary judgment, it is possible to conjure up a case, I'm sure, which would be stronger than this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.252" offset="10174002">Well, we are drawing the distinction, for example, between summary judgment and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict which follows, or in the case of Bose, for example, which follows an entire record being made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.199" offset="10261773">They were not taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.483" offset="10270864">On the other side, if I might say, we hear raised the question of the chilling effect upon the news media if they are forced to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.993" offset="10324885">I must say that I have seen enough of the gigantic conglomerates which are in the business of publishing information about sports, entertainment and some news, enough to see of them that they are not easily chilled, they are often clothed so strongly in their own arrogance that they could, I believe, go through the ice age without having their body temperature lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.442" offset="10418717">But if one is concerned about that and the chilling effect hat one is concerned about is the massive verdicts, yet, on the other hand, is the First Amendment right of the plaintiff to speak out and the chilling effect upon an unpopular dissenting plaintiff who wishes to speak out and who wishes, if malice is utilized in attacking and destroying his reputation, to at least avail himself of his First Amendment and Second Amendment right to have this question adjudicated before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.593" offset="10531357">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.862" offset="10960392">If the plaintiff can have his position vindicated, if the concern of the chilling effect upon the news media can then be addressed, I suggest by a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, where something can be done about any damages, excessive or otherwise, which have been awarded by the jury; in that fashion the chilling effect can be addressed, if there is one, although I have never seen this apocryphal chilling effect documented over the years, but if it exists, it can be dealt with certainly by that independent review, and at the same time, the First Amendment rights of the plaintiff may be protected by permitting him to speak out and his Seventh Amendment rights protected by permitting him to have a trial before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.891" offset="11140532">The case, in conclusions, the case here rests upon the allegation by the petitioners that my client is not entitled to try, to go to a jury, to try a case where part of the case is based exclusively upon allegations which were previously published and found to be defamatory, and then republished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.213" offset="11273757">Part of the case which exists is based upon the allegation by the editor of the defendant publication that this publication, this caricature, this cartoon, could be libelous and should not be published, and they published it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.276" offset="11350034">And part of it is based upon the look-alike of the St. Amant apocryphal figure come to life with the defendant having stated about him, we don't know if he's reliable, we don't care if he's reliable, it does not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.386" offset="11414505">That is reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.821" offset="11424222">And I say it is possible to conjure up another case where a plaintiff in a public figure libel matter can have a case tried if this one is not, but it does require, I believe, a fertile imagination.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Branson</label>
            <text syncTime="2845.638" offset="11523487">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.638" offset="11531533">I would like in my time to respond to two questions, one from Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.975" offset="11552849">He asked, does it make a difference what standard we apply at summary judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.177" offset="11569672">And the answer is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.763" offset="11576046">As the Court said in that Addington v. Texas, we are not engaged in a semantic application of words we are engaged in setting values, First Amendment values and the values of Rule 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.670" offset="11619618">And with regard to this case, we particularly take the Court of Appeals at its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.705" offset="11635814">Had they applied the clear and convincing standard, we believe the Court of Appeals would have found for the defendants and have sustained the judgment of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.478" offset="11666847">And therefore I respond next to Mr. Justice White's question who suggested that the proper course, should you apply the clear and convincing standard, is to remand to the circuit court for its determination of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.952" offset="11712718">I suggest to you that the jurisprudence of this Court demonstrates that you have yourself made those determinations in these cases, with one exception, and that exception was Firestone, and that case was remanded for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.009" offset="11764963">The Firestone case had been tried in the courts in Florida on a strict liability theory, and this court held that the negligence theory announced in Gertz had to be applied to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.632" offset="11803520">Therefore, the plaintiffs had made no record in the trial court on negligence, and it would have been impossible for this Court to assess the record in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.638" offset="11835494">But in all the other cases where the record has been complete, this Court has made the assessment, and while you could remand it--</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.196" offset="11993692">It may be better to have the court which is deciding which standard to apply to say what it means by applying the standard to the facts of that case.</text>
