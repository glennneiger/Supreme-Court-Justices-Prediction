            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144691">We will hear argument this morning in The City of Renton, et al. v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., et al. Mr. Prettyman, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="73.378" offset="438203">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.127" offset="445099">This case, which comes here from the Ninth Circuit, involves an attempt by a small city in the State of Washington to zone adult theatres away from residence, churches, parks and schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.995" offset="508629">You'll recall that in 1976 in Young &lt;v@l&gt; [= v.] American Min Theatres, you upheld a Detroit ordinance which treated adult theatres differently than general fare theatres because of the adverse secondary effects caused by the adult theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.862" offset="588041">The City of Renton's attempt began more than a year before any adult theatres had actually come into the city, but the secondary effects of these theatres had been perceived nearby in the State of Washington, in the City of Tacoma, in the City of Spokane, and just a mile to the north in the City of Seattle, which had had its own case which had gone through the state supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.554" offset="710817">This Court had denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.975" offset="720534">The zoning ordinance in that case has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.613" offset="731088">Renton wanted to deal with this problem before it became a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.672" offset="759300">It wanted to obviate these secondary effects before they ever got into the city, because, quite candidly, some other cities, as a result of Young, had attempted to deal with specific situations in front of them, and those ordinances had been struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.010" offset="820635">So, Renton, during the following year, the City Council, through its committees studied what had happened in other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.522" offset="858774">It looked at the opinions that had come down in other places; not just in the State of Washington but in other cities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.957" offset="884479">It held a number of meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.659" offset="891271">These were public meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.064" offset="900884">In some of them it listened to citizens voice their concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.562" offset="918856">These citizens were not only from Renton but from some from nearby cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.186" offset="937351">And it finally passed one of three ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.199" offset="949471">The first ordinance prohibited the location of adult theatres within 1,000 feet of residences, of single or multi-family dwellings, churches, or parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.805" offset="999835">As to schools, this first ordinance provided that adult theatres could not be located within a mile of these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.160" offset="1033272">That was later reduced in the second ordinance to 1,000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.518" offset="1050722">After the first ordinance was passed, Appellees, whom i'll call Playtime, brought a suit in Renton seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction based on their First Amendment rights anti equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.777" offset="1115715">And they shortly thereafter, virtually within the same week, brought two existing general fare theatres in downtown Renton, in one of which they said they intended to show adult fare on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.583" offset="1174960">The result of our second ordinance, when you drew circles around the areas that these theatres could not locate next to, in effect created a permissive or set-aside zone in the City of Renton which consisted of some 520 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.966" offset="1252492">This is, incidentally, a larger area than the entire commercial area of the City of Renton, and it is more acres than all of the multi-family residences in the City of Renton.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.961" offset="1308498">The district court said that--</text>

            <text syncTime="789.243" offset="3301641">One of the things that I think people forget when they look at Young is everybody concentrates on the fact that the prescription was 1,000 feet from any two other adult uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.505" offset="3346676">What they forget is that in the Young ordinance, it also prohibited adult theatres within 500 feet of residences, and that particular prescription wasn't even fought in this Court, I assume, because it was assumed to be, assumed to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.046" offset="3404773">But that was part of the Young ordinance, and we had that to look to, and therefore ours is really a tighter and more permissive ordinance in that respect than--</text>

            <text syncTime="835.428" offset="3486379">This Court said in Young that it made no difference, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.739" offset="3499545">In fact, you approved both methods, both the dispersal method and the concentration method.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.404" offset="3570284">So, our point in regard to whether we could rely on the experience of other cities is very simple, and that is, what was there for us to study?</text>

            <text syncTime="887.017" offset="3692747">Let me tell you that Renton is an interesting town in this respect, because it doesn't have this commercial area over here and the churches over here and the residential area over here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.510" offset="8890696">The essential difference between this case and Young is that there is an intolerable burden on speech that exists as a result of this ordinance, and that's problem of access.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.360" offset="8986095">On the other hand, if government does make the rule and government does limit access, then I think government has the duty to establish that not only are there permissible locations, but that somebody can actually go there, because otherwise they've precluded them through a de facto zoning scheme from going anywhere, and they're created what they've perhaps set out to do, was censor the material and remove it entirely from the City.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.084" offset="12496952">I would say, in conclusion, that the notion that pervades Renton's ordinance is that there's a need to protect certain places, schools, churches, and so on from adult theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.547" offset="12554840">But that need, that express need, the whole purpose of this ordinance is nullified by the under-inclusiveness of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.920" offset="12584306">This ordinance deals only with adult theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.433" offset="12598412">There is no evidence in this record or anything that I can find that establishes that an adult theatre has a different operational characteristic or effect upon these places than other adult businesses which are not regulated and not subject to the burden of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.504" offset="12662673">For those reasons, Your Honor, I would submit that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.970" offset="12704469">Three brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.281" offset="12717739">First, my co-counsel tells me I said that I was out there ten years, and I meant ten days ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.294" offset="12741772">I apologize to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.309" offset="12745847">The first point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.604" offset="12755042">Mr. Burns said that there's nothing in the record to indicate that adult theatres attract people other than those that are here in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.758" offset="12783672">I assure you that that is not the case; that this record shows, through Mr. Clemmons' testimony, who attended virtually all of these meetings, that what these committees and the City Council considered were the experiences of other cities as reflected in some documents, but primarily in the decisions which, as Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, fully set forth precisely what had gone on in those communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.577" offset="12882938">Justice Stevens, in the Seattle case, Northend Cinema, if you... they noted that the Apple Theatre, for example, in the First Hill community by itself, and then two other theatres in another residential community, had the adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.304" offset="12949811">Mr. Clemmons had been, incidentally, for seven years in Milpedes, California, where they had had an adult problem, and he was familiar with that and could tell the City Council about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.268" offset="12993697">The record also indicates that we looked at Tacoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.455" offset="13006444">Tacoma had a case which the Ninth Circuit, where they approved a zoning ordinance in an unreported decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.068" offset="13108949">If you want to see a good example of a study which goes to a single theatre, look at the Phoenix study, which is cited in our brief, which compared a single adult theatre in an area with another area that did not have one and found, for example, that the crime rate was three times as high.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.734" offset="13187525">You're now focusing on the justification for the ordinance, and turn your attention to what remains available for the adult theatres, that phase of the case, and that as Justice Powell pointed out, the district court found that there was ample accessible real estate there, and the court of appeals then says the standard of review is de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.929" offset="13260355">What, in your view, is the correct standard of review of that finding of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.897" offset="13272267">That was going to be my third point, and I'll go to it immediately, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.661" offset="13287313">It seems, the reason that we haven't paid much attention to that in our briefs is that we're happy to have you use strict scrutiny if you want to, because we think we passed the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.875" offset="13324093">But it seems to use that the Bose test is really a strange one to use in this context for the reasons that Justice Powell pointed out, and it is very interesting that the Ninth Circuit itself, different panels admittedly, in the Tacoma case and the City of Carona case, which is cited by Mr. Burns in one of his later briefs, both use the clearly erroneous test in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.583" offset="13430987">And it seems to us that in a situation where you have such an incidental restriction on First Amendment rights as opposed to one where you have a total exclusion or some factor such as the malice situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.171" offset="13949360">Do they have a right, do they have a constitutional right to be where they want to be, where most customers are walking by the door, where they don't have to put up signs because there's so many people walking by that they'll get a ready audience?</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.259" offset="14013726">Or can we put them away from where they're doing the harm but where people can still go, you still have plenty of film, plenty of theatres, plenty of access, and everybody can see what they want to?</text>
