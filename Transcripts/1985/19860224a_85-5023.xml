            <text syncTime="38.256" offset="272947">They left Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.125" offset="276395">They disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.158" offset="280575">The next morning they find the van.</text>

            <text syncTime="45.160" offset="300532">Some $281,000 of the money is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.897" offset="319550">The bodies are subsequently found a month later apparently drowning and/or combination heart attack in the case of Mr. Dempsey.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.436" offset="357688">The bodies are recovered on the Nevada side of Lake Mead in Debbie's Cove.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.023" offset="380049">Those facts are not what we are really talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.041" offset="396036">We are talking an issue of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.743" offset="406903">The Polands went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.679" offset="414635">They were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.714" offset="422785">Pursuant to our procedure on aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court on the first sentencing proceeding found one aggravating circumstance, especially heinous, cruel and depraved.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.491" offset="485897">He specifically found no on pecuniary gain, but he qualified that answer, and I will get back to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.247" offset="516931">They were sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.149" offset="536470">The court did find certain mitigating circumstances, that they had good character, close family ties, model prisoners, and the court did consider their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.672" offset="582655">Automatic appeal under our procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.124" offset="604389">The case is appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.194" offset="620689">They, in handling the guilt phase of the trial, they find that there has been jury impropriety that is not material here, that they are granted a new trial on the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.288" offset="685055">The Court goes on to discuss the punishment phase, and in discussing the punishment phase, they find that it was not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence thus far shows it was especially cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.867" offset="763422">In addition, they also went on to find it has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that it was especially heinous or depraved.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.579" offset="834266">In remanding the case for a new trial, they do admonish the trial judge or suggest to him that if the Poland boys are found guilty next time, you may consider pecuniary gain in that the offense was committed in the expectation of or consideration for the receipt of something of value.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.797" offset="971148">They found like in Mr. Rumsey, Judge Coulter in Rumsey I found... he didn't agree with the law as then interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.522" offset="1017959">Our trial occurred and sentencing before State v. Clark which was, I believe, July of 1980, and the opinion released in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.579" offset="1058188">The initial sentence on Poland was in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.947" offset="1079713">But he did find that this was not pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.653" offset="1110537">He considered it limited to the contract type killing, but if we were to consider pecuniary gain as more broad, then they did receive something of value, $281,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.544" offset="1166126">And that was before the case went to the Supreme Court of Arizona the first time?</text>

            <text syncTime="265.531" offset="1182008">No, that was the Supreme Court's... oh, yes, that was the trial judge's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.817" offset="1203220">Then it goes to the Supreme Court, and then that is when they find that the one aggravating circumstance found by the trial judge was not supported by the evidence, but he made error on the other one or... not error, misinterpreted the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.563" offset="1278139">The case comes back to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.031" offset="1296007">They are again convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.550" offset="1306142">Another aggravating, mitigating hearing, and this time in the case of petitioner Patrick Poland there are three aggravating circumstances found.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.108" offset="1352327">In the interim while his case was on appeal he was convicted of another offense in Phoenix, Arizona, in Federal Court, an armed robbery, and that was used as an aggravating circumstance under E-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.986" offset="1419827">In addition, they found that both petitioners had committed this crime for pecuniary gain, and in spite of what the Arizona Supreme Court said the first time around, the trial court also found it was especially heinous, cruel and depraved.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.579" offset="1482207">Mitigating circumstance, we lost one.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.233" offset="1504882">They had close family ties, but they did not have good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.904" offset="1531527">Their character was false, in that they were deceptive and had committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.873" offset="1559425">The appeal goes up the second time on Poland II.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.646" offset="1586488">One of the issues, and the only issue we are concerned with, is the double jeopardy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.198" offset="1608745">The Arizona Supreme Court found that it did not offend double jeopardy, and they did not agree, nor shall any person be subject for a same offense to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.178" offset="1688679">What is the purpose of double jeopardy?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.130" offset="1704457">It has got many concepts, and it depends on what direction the case and the posture of it is coming out.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.533" offset="1726087">One of the fundamental principles of double jeopardy is, Mr. Prosecutor, you get one fair, full chance to present your evidence, and if you do, fine, and if you don't, you want another second bite at the apple, then that is when this veil of double jeopardy comes down upon the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.315" offset="1821172">Why does double jeopardy apply in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.367" offset="1837368">It boils down to really maybe a hard question to answer but a simple issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.671" offset="1862655">What we have is trial error detrimental to the state, prejudicial to the state in that the judge should have found pecuniary gain the first time around but he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.382" offset="1925453">Then we have another trial error, which would be detrimental to the petitioners, insufficient evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.636" offset="1958472">Didn't the trial court find sufficient facts to meet the definition of pecuniary gain in the Arizona statute the first time out?</text>
            <text syncTime="468.076" offset="1992222">He just didn't think those facts met the legal definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.480" offset="2013852">Just like in Rumsey, when Judge Coulter said, I don't agree with the way the law is being interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.085" offset="2052304">I don't agree with that, and I don't... it is stated in Matson.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.989" offset="2067873">I didn't understand the trial court the first time around to say I don't agree with the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.959" offset="2099742">There would have been no decision from the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.625" offset="2110400">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.411" offset="2113535">At that time State v. Clark had not come out, as cited by the trial lawyers in their memorandum sentencing... I believe it is March the 25th of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.985" offset="2163899">They cite several cases that have been before the Supreme Court of Arizona that involve pecuniary gain, just as Mr. Rumsey involved pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.490" offset="2201933">He was convicted of robbery, which was not set aside, but it was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.561" offset="2222204">The law as interpreted at the trial level was one of reading special aggravating circumstance E4 and E5 as a combination, E4 being the man who hires the contract type killing, E5 the man who performs it or maybe someone who would kill for inheritance or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.812" offset="2335158">The argument at the first sentencing hearing before Judge Rosenblatt, petitioner's counsel were exclusively directing their argument to the status of the law and trying to understand what it was, and in their memorandum they went to great length and cite other jurisdictions on how they handled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.161" offset="2420526">In fact, even the state's memorandum thought maybe this might be limited to the Mafia-type killing, but be that as it may, and then he did argue they planned this job as the evidence in the trial had shown, and the drivers did die, therefore they received pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.209" offset="2524807">Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.632" offset="2550407">Petitioners' position is, jeopardy attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.702" offset="2574753">We had a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.202" offset="2580709">We had a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.002" offset="2583948">And we had death pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.821" offset="2595233">Petitioner now goes up to to the Arizona Supreme Court and hit a hole in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.527" offset="2621982">Insufficient evidence, not showing beyond a reasonable doubt, the only aggravating circumstance, especially heinous, cruel and depraved, and each one of those would constitute an aggravating circumstance in the disjunctive to warrant death penalty was not proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.757" offset="2710903">Petitioners rely on Burkes as cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.327" offset="2733264">We rely upon Green v. Massey, which applied Burkes to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.915" offset="2759595">And then we also rely on Hudson v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.969" offset="2779762">The purpose there of Hudson was to show that it didn't mean any evidence, but it has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.293" offset="2825110">Those cases would show that the status of the petitioner's case when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in Poland I is what can be done from here.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.754" offset="2902955">There is insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.225" offset="2916852">The only way we can cure this is send it back for a new trial on death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.694" offset="2938691">Enter Mr. Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.998" offset="2951961">Mr. Bullington was convicted, the only distinction being Bullington and Rumsey didn't receive death.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.954" offset="2991772">The double jeopardy, we are not talking merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.672" offset="3014655">We are talking whether that veil is there or not and whether or not it requires a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.660" offset="3034612">Bullington tells us that there are two separate trials, one on guilt and one on innocent, I mean, on punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.700" offset="3074736">The one on punishment is independent of the one on guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.669" offset="3090619">Because of the constitutional change Mr. Bullington received a new guilt trial, entitled to a different panel of the jury, but they couldn't retry him on punishment, and this Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.964" offset="3167732">Further, the Arizona Supreme Court, interpreting its own law in Rumsey II has made it quite clear that double jeopardy applies to Arizona's death sentencing procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.000" offset="4411892">The guards disappeared, and that van disappeared some time early on May the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.172" offset="4448568">The van was found the next morning at about 6:30 in the morning, locked, in a desolate area of Yavapai County about halfway between Phoenix and the little village of Prescott, where their first deliveries were to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.732" offset="4614812">They are found floating in Lake Mead a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.653" offset="4638531">Was their killing in consideration or in expectation of pecuniary gain, or if you are in another... like some other states have statutes and aggravating circumstances where if you are going to dispose of a witness to this crime, that constitutes an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.102" offset="4728287">Do we take every feasible situation and try to squeeze it into pecuniary gain?</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.588" offset="4754305">The trial lawyer argued strictly from the standpoint of the law on the issue, that it is limited to the hired gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.480" offset="4797878">So the misinterpretation of the law if one wants to characterize it as such was really a common interpretation made across the state of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.525" offset="4869976">This death penalty was passed in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.560" offset="4882201">Here we are, July of 1980, before we get to the Clark case for an interpretation that it is not limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.582" offset="4914279">What is necessary again is a multiple trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.034" offset="4936013">You have got to have another hearing on this, and as a result of that second hearing, the Polands' lost ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.723" offset="4966838">They lost their good character in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.675" offset="4974674">The same evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.092" offset="4980317">What new occurred?</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.794" offset="4987109">The next point would be that the weight or the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the one pecuniary gain found by the cruel, heinous, and depraved found by the Arizona court based on a reading of Richmond and likewise in Watson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.092" offset="5088255">The Arizona court in looking at an aggravating circumstance doesn't weigh the evidence as perhaps the Florida court does, where they have Zandt v. Green and their earlier cases, where if the evidence was so tenuous it wouldn't support this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.375" offset="5181460">We have the right as a judge to send it back to the trial court and have a new hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.595" offset="5202253">Arizona, we looked to see whether or not there is evidence to support this aggravating, and we look to see whether or not there is evidence to support the mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.938" offset="5259723">Then the court would weigh these in their independent reviews, one against another, and then their, of course... review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.977" offset="5295876">Certainly as far as one of the statements... the Arizona Supreme Court in relying upon their decision in Poland II and saying we do not agree, they refer to a case called Knapp v. Carwell, which is an unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.724" offset="5386782">Knapp v. Carwell results from an earlier case which was called State v. Watson, where the constitutionality of the Arizona death penalty that was involved here was first brought to the attention of the Arizona Supreme Court, and by judicial interpretation they found that the statute wasn't unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.477" offset="5505796">This was an answer in regard to Lockett v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.047" offset="5520111">They go through this case and one thing they find is that double jeopardy doesn't apply in the Watson case, because its resentencing is ameliorating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.758" offset="5594926">Who has been damaged by limiting mitigating circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.762" offset="5622929">Only the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.030" offset="5628049">Subsequently, when this gets cleared up, and then we get a class action of all the people down on death row, it goes into the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.838" offset="5679249">They in that time, in making their decision to the Ninth Circuit, compare Arizona's procedure to Missouri, and they find a big distinction at that point, because it involved a judge in Bullington... I mean, excuse me... yes, the judge in Bullington and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.274" offset="5797009">In Bullington the jury determines it, but in Arizona the judge does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.797" offset="5827102">That was the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.713" offset="5830759">And in addition, they found that the sentencing procedure is ameliorative, that these people haven't started serving their death sentence, so double jeopardy does not apply, and further, one case out of that whole group presents an issue somewhat compatible with the issue here, and that was Mr. Valencia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.578" offset="5930234">Mr. Valencia had been convicted and sentenced to death on murder, and then he had been resentenced pursuant to Watson before the court heard Knapp v. Carwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.386" offset="5977463">Mr. Valencia, due to the publicity of his first conviction, had a lady come into the Tucson port and indicate she had been raped by that man, and so there was a subsequent trial on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.127" offset="6028454">He was convicted, and then when he was resentenced per Lockett and Arizona's Watson, they brought up this second new aggravating circumstance, but in the Ninth Circuit, in light of our finding that Watson changed in interpretation his procedural and ameliorative, that Bullington is distinguishable, and we hold double jeopardy does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.886" offset="6283514">The van and its guards, Cecil Newkirk and Russell Dempsey, were on their way on a regularly scheduled run to deliver money to banks in northern Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.825" offset="6319249">The petitioners managed to subdue the guards, and they removed something in excess of $280,000 in cash from the van and took it with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.181" offset="6356656">The following morning, petitioners rented a boat at Lake Mead in northern Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.362" offset="6453414">The testimony of the medical examiner at the trial indicated that the cause of death of both men was drowning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.700" offset="6478701">He had a slight qualification with respect to Mr. Dempsey in that he found some evidence of heart disease, and he testified that that could have been a possible cause of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.524" offset="6522064">However, his testimony was that the cause of death of both men was drowning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.560" offset="6538155">It was based upon these facts that petitioners were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.630" offset="6570443">Petitioners are now claiming that the double jeopardy clause precludes their death sentences because the Arizona Supreme Court acquitted them of the death penalty on their first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.271" offset="6608999">Respondent submits that no court in the state of Arizona has acquitted petitioners of the death penalty, and that the state has never failed to prove its case for imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.345" offset="6665319">Petitioners admit that the trial court imposed the death penalty at their first sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.733" offset="6686844">With respect to the trial court's findings at that sentencing, however, the petitioners do not clearly focus on all the findings that the trial court made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.339" offset="6725296">According to petitioners, the trial court simply found that one aggravating circumstance existed, that being the cruel, heinous, or depraved nature of the killings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.996" offset="6767928">Petitioners also maintain that the trial court simply found that a second factor, that being that the killings were committed for a pecuniary motive, did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.454" offset="6809724">The trial court's findings were not that simple, especially with respect to the pecuniary gain factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.691" offset="6834697">Counsel in argument has likened the trial court's handling of the pecuniary gain factor in this case to the handling of that same factor by the trial court in Rumsey--</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.389" offset="7241476">The dispute was between whether the pecuniary gain factor applied to contract killings only or whether it went farther to embrace all killings where the obtaining of money is a motivating factor in the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.149" offset="7300513">At the time of the first sentencing, as counsel has pointed out, the trial court did not have the benefit of later Arizona Supreme Court opinions defining the pecuniary gain factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.105" offset="7340323">It thus faced the problem of determining for itself what the exact legal meaning of the factor was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.457" offset="7773747">That is what it did first, before discussing the findings by the trial court with respect to the aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.146" offset="7808542">After the Arizona Supreme Court had reversed the conviction, as counsel pointed out, it went on to discuss the findings on the aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.137" offset="7856503">It stated with respect to the cruel, heinous, and depraved factor that the evidence, in the court's words, "so far produced" was not sufficient to support the trial court's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.845" offset="7899344">On the pecuniary gain factor, it quoted the exact findings that the trial court had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.249" offset="7928914">It then noted the trial court's confusion over the legal meaning of the pecuniary gain factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.253" offset="7956918">It provided the trial court with the correct definition of that factor, and then it in effect advised the trial court that in the event of a conviction following a retrial, that that factor could be found again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.794" offset="8003102">Petitioner's contention is that an acquittal occurred on the death penalty issue at the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.666" offset="8038629">I believe the basis of the argument for an acquittal is that when the Arizona Supreme Court found the evidence insufficient with respect to the cruel, heinous, or depraved factor, essentially there was nothing left to support the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.194" offset="8100696">This position fails to deal with the trial court's finding on the pecuniary gain aggravating factor and the Supreme Court's own discussion regarding that same factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.002" offset="8155971">There is admittedly no failure of proof with respect to that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.755" offset="8174988">Even at resentencing, there was no argument by the petitioners that the state's evidence was exactly the same as it had been at the first sentencing, did not show that these killings were committed with a financial motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.797" offset="8223158">Even though the Arizona Supreme Court found that one aggravating factor was not sufficient would prove the trial court's findings with respect to the aggravating factor were sufficient to prevent an acquittal in Poland I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.723" offset="8286792">One of the major factors in this Court's decisions regarding double jeopardy cases, it involves the special treatment that acquittals are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.136" offset="8360457">The double jeopardy clause is designed to protect defendants from having to go through a second ordeal of a trial or in death penalty cases that are sufficiently like a trial, a second sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.813" offset="8419181">A retrial after an acquittal would force a defendant to undergo that ordeal a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.848" offset="8439347">Therefore, when the proceedings terminate in favor of the defendant with an acquittal, double jeopardy protection will apply, and that will be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.740" offset="8478844">In this case, there simply no acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.274" offset="8493055">There was no point in this case when the defendants could consider themselves free of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.595" offset="8514266">The trial court's findings with respect to the pecuniary gain factor kept that issue open, and prevented the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in Poland I from amounting to an acquittal on the issue of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.105" offset="8572363">In the absence of such an acquittal, the rationale that this Court discussed in Pierce would apply here, but petitioners' appeal and obtaining of a reversal of their convictions on appeal in effect wipes the slate clean and allows not only for a second trial but for a second sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.768" offset="8655014">There has been some argument in the brief regarding a failure to appeal by the state with respect to the trial court's finding at the first sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.092" offset="8712274">It is respondent's position that there was simply no need for the state to appeal from that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.313" offset="8733172">There had been nothing decided, to its detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.182" offset="8744666">The trial court specifically found that the evidence the state presented supported a finding that the killings were committed for a financial motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.304" offset="8781133">Furthermore, the Arizona Supreme Court in all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed does conduct what it calls an independent review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.977" offset="8815824">That review is not the usual review that an appellate court does when it comes to reviewing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.082" offset="8848216">With respect to the aggravating and mitigating factors, the Arizona Supreme Court conducts an independent review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.236" offset="8868905">It independently weighs the evidence regarding each aggravating factor and each mitigating factor and determines the weight for itself they should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.557" offset="8902132">Because of that independent review performed by the Arizona Supreme Court, there was no need for the state to appeal in this case.</text>
