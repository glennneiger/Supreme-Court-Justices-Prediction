            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146237">We will hear arguments first this afternoon in United States against Koecher.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="182599">Mr. Wright, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="12.224" stopTime="405.311">
            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="195034">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in November of 1984, respondent was called before a grand jury investigating espionage, and asked three questions: whether she had ever met with agents of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service; whether she had ever delivered classified documents relating to the national security of the United States to those agents; and whether she had ever been paid for the delivery of those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.458" offset="307987">She refused to answer, claiming that her answers would be adverse to the interests of her husband, and citing both the marital testimonial privilege and the marital confidential communications privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.849" offset="357620">She has since agreed that no confidential communications would be involved in answering the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="388026">A hearing was held on whether respondent wanted to be ordered to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="417806">At that hearing, the government argued, relying on cases from the Seventh and Tenth Circuits, that the marital testimonial privilege does not apply in cases involving joint participation in criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.885" offset="469737">In support of our claim of joint participation, we offered an affidavit of an FBI agent who had interviewed respondent's husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.391" offset="503801">That affidavit stated that Mr. Koecher said that he and respondent had met with Czech agents on a number of occasions between 1962 and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="548627">In the early 1960's, they were directed to penetrate U.S. intelligence agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="571928">They subsequently moved to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.019" offset="582273">Mr. Koecher got a job with the CIA, and he passed virtually any secret material he obtained while employed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="618531">Mrs. Koecher served as his courier delivering documents and receiving payments for the delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.099" offset="654580">At the hearing, respondent did not contest our evidence regarding joint participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.087" offset="678508">Instead, relying on Third Circuit cases, she argued the marital testimonial privilege applies even when there is joint participation in criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.025" offset="722289">The District Court agreed with the government, ordered respondent to answer the questions, and subsequently ordered her held in civil contempt when she refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="760219">She spent about four months in jail but refused to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.052" offset="778400">In December of 1964, a one-count indictment was returned charging Mr. Koecher with espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="807448">That indictment alleged that he removed a certain four-page document from the CIA in 1975 and had it delivered to Czech agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.930" offset="849871">At the Second Circuit's direction, the District Court considered whether the dominant or sole purpose of the grand jury in continuing to seek to question respondent was to obtain evidence for use at Mr. Koecher's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.291" offset="915386">The District Court concluded that that was not the grand jury's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.327" offset="931478">Rather, it concluded that the indictment would appear to barely scratch the surface, and that it would be reasonable and logical for the grand jury to continue to seek answers to many other questions such as who worked with Mr. Koecher at the CIA, who were the Czech agents to whom Mrs. Koecher delivered documents, and what other documents and information other than the four-page document mentioned in the indictment have been delivered to the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="1055403">The Second Circuit subsequently declined to accept our argument that the marital testimony of privilege does not apply in cases involving joint participation, and reversed the District Court's decision ordering respondent to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.891" offset="1117783">The issue before this Court, therefore, is whether when spouses jointly participate in criminal activity, a privilege against giving adverse testimony should be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.747" offset="1161146">The Trammel decision sets out the two factors to be considered in determining whether the privilege should be recognized in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.805" offset="1201375">On the one hand, there is the need for probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.589" offset="1216526">On the other hand, there is the interest in marital harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.843" offset="1233558">The Trammel decision shows that those interests must be weighed against each other to determine whether the privilege ought to be recognized in certain classes of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.783" offset="1273368">In cases that do not involve joint participation, we contend that the Trammel decision shows that those interests are nearly at equilibrium.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.039" offset="1310358">Nineteen states have abolished the privilege altogether, concluding that the need for evidence outweighs the interest in marital harmony in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.395" offset="1347765">Distinguished commentators such as Wigmore and McCormack have also called for abolition of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.416" offset="1375873">And influential model rules such as the model code of evidence and the uniform rules of evidence have also abolished the privilege while leaving the marital communications privilege intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.010" offset="1434178">The need for evidence is a weighty need.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.978" offset="1450061">This Court has 13 times cited... for Hardwick's 1812 statement that the public has a right to every man's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.568" offset="1488408">In Branzburg v. Hayes, the Court concluded that the public's right to evidence outweighed the First Amended interest of newsmen in protecting their confidential sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.559" offset="1536369">The Court stated that the public interest in law enforcement and in ensuring effective grand jury proceedings overrides the consequential but uncertain burden on news gathering that is said to result from insisting that reporters like other citizens answer questions put to them in grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.805" offset="1617453">In United States v. Nixon, similarly, the need for evidence was held to outweigh the President's interest in confidentiality in the communications in his own office.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.713" offset="1673042">As in Branzburg, the Court noted that the need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and central to fair adjudication of a particular case such that without access to specific facts, a criminal prosecution may be totally frustrated, while the need for confidentiality is general and uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.228" offset="1763112">The Court added--</text>

            <text syncTime="629.133" offset="2662769">Well, we think we have to do more than charge as a co-conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.069" offset="2674472">The District Court would have to agree with us that we had come forward with independent evidence showing that there was a probable cause to believe that she was a joint participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.190" offset="2710939">In analogous circumstances involving the marital communications privilege or the lawyer-client privilege, which also do not protect communications made in furtherance of joint criminal activities, courts have faced similar problems, and they have not been insurmountable by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.421" offset="2791919">It is worth pointing out that the need for probative evidence is greater in cases involving joint participation, and that in connection with that the privilege, if recognized, will as a practical matter often shield third parties as well as spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.234" offset="2871122">The marital privileges have frequently been asserted, as the cases we site show, in drug cases, for example, which have often involved large teams of conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.992" offset="2926188">Thus, as a practical matter, if the government cannot compel testimony in any circumstances, a number of third parties are likely to benefit as well, as this case shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.033" offset="2970283">We don't know who those third parties are, but specifically, that is, although presumably there are Czech agents who are shielded, we cannot get this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.359" offset="3023573">On the other side of the balance from the need for probative evidence is the interest in preserving marital harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.632" offset="3060666">As an initial matter, it is worth noting that this interest, like the interest asserted in Branzburg and in U.S. v. Nixon, are uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.373" offset="3107687">It may have no effect at all, abolition of the testimonial privilege, at least in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.046" offset="3142377">Contrary to respondent's repeated suggestions, there is simply nothing about compelled testimony that automatically leads to dissolution of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.418" offset="3183860">Indeed, respondent's argument is somewhat contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.388" offset="3199742">On one hand, she has repeatedly stated that she is so devoted to her husband and he to him that she will never testify against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.911" offset="3237881">At the same time, however, she implies that their marriage will disintegrate automatically if she answers our questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.831" offset="3269541">He suspect that she exaggerates on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.969" offset="3286051">Moreover, as this Court suggested in Hawkins, we think that there is less danger of an adverse effect on marital harmony when testimony is compelled than there is when the testimony is voluntarily given by a spouse in return, for example, for a promise of leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.232" offset="3367135">The Court of Appeals here did not appear to understand that there is a utilitarian aspect as well as a non-utilitarian aspect to the interest in marital harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.940" offset="3413946">It concluded that a marriage between criminals can be devoted and essentially ended its inquiry at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.927" offset="3441845">It thus overlooked the public interest in marital harmony even though this Court stressed that public interest in Trammel, and even though commentators have always assumed that privileges exist to serve utilitarian purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.687" offset="4736892">There is another reason why the interest in preserving marital harmony is diminished in cases involving drug participation that I haven't mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.143" offset="4774717">It is that recognition of the privilege in this case actually encourages the recruitment of spouses as co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.082" offset="4810557">It is true that after this Court's Trammel decision, a spouse cannot be sure that his co-conspirator spouse won't decide to testify against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.538" offset="4852353">But there is still a significant advantage in recruiting a spouse as a co-conspirator if the privilege is recognized, as this case illustrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.145" offset="4890805">Thus, viewed prospectively, it is the privilege that is likely to harm the institution of marriage by encouraging criminals to recruit their spouses as co-conspirators if the exceptions we propose is not recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.782" offset="5017342">Again, summarization our argument, the position we have made is that the interests to be weighed are very close without our exception, and we thin that there is added weight on the side of the need for probative evidence because co-conspirator spouses are likely to have more evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.380" offset="5107726">We think there is less weight on the site of protecting marital harmony because it is not clear that compelled testimony will have an effect, because there is little or no societal interest in preserving marriages between criminals, and because recognizing privilege in these circumstances encourages a recruitment of spouses as co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.312" offset="5199468">I would like to briefly discuss two arguments respondent makes that do not add to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.216" offset="5227053">One argument that respondent repeatedly makes is an argument that decent people have a natural repugnance to watching one spouse testify against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.672" offset="5264879">As an initial matter, it is worth noting that Wigmore, who coined the phrase "natural repugnance", dismissed this argument summarily, and that this Court in comprehensively reviewing the privilege in Trammel did not mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.182" offset="5322870">Nevertheless, we do not think that there is nothing to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.884" offset="5337708">Instead, we think it is merely a restatement of the personal interest, the non-utilitarian interest in marital harmony that weighs on the other side of the balance, the side favoring that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.809" offset="5389430">But we think it is nothing more than that, and we do not think it is a particularly weighty factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.530" offset="5412314">Some people, at least, have a natural repugnance to evidentiary rules that allow guilty defendants to go free because of the introduction of evidence against them that proves their guilt has been prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.938" offset="5465917">And in cases of joint participation in criminal activity, any sympathy we might otherwise feel for the spouse, the witness spouse who faces a difficult decision between testifying, between perjuring herself, and between being held in contempt, is lessened considerably by the fact that she has brought this upon herself by agreeing to participate in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.470" offset="5560062">The other argument is respondent's repeated suggestion that the marital privilege somehow has a constitutional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.976" offset="5590051">There is simply nothing in the Constitution nor in this Court's decisions that suggests that the privilege is constitutionally based and, of course, constitutionalizing the privilege would interferes with the common law process that many states have used to abolish the privilege altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.871" offset="5665701">Furthermore, to the extent that respondent appears to believe that the constitutional basis for this privilege is the right to privacy, we think she has her marital privileges confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.828" offset="5709483">If either of the privileges involves the right to privacy, it is the confidential communications privilege, not the testimonial privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.015" offset="5742293">That no privacy interest is implicated in these cases... in these case, rather, can be determined clearly by reading the three questions that respondent has refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.992" offset="5790149">It is also worth noting that an exception like the joint participant exception that we favor has been recognized for all other privileges, as I mentioned previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.649" offset="5840826">The reason for that, we submit, is that the social utility in recognizing a privilege is severely lessened when the privilege is used to shield joint criminal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.111" offset="8578668">What I would suggest to the Court is that if there is any analogous privilege, and the government places great stress on various other privileges, it is not the attorney-client, it is not even the marital confidential communications privilege, it is the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.038" offset="8642302">There is no other privilege that exists in our law, which is like the marital testimonial privilege in giving a witness the blanket right to refuse to testify against some other person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.801" offset="8725372">But the privilege is not to testify about the particular narrow kind of communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.627" offset="8776676">In those situations, it makes sense to say that if a particular kind of communication, one, for example, in furtherance of crime, is not within the nature of the kinds of communications we are encouraging by the privilege, then the privilege shouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.236" offset="8843132">The privilege we have got here is a blanket sort of privilege, and as I say, the only analogy to it is the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.476" offset="8984088">Now, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that metaphor has certainly been maliciously applied in some circumstances to undermine the separate position of a woman, for example, separate right to property, and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.469" offset="9036020">But the basic insight underlying that metaphor, that husband and wife, for one, is not something that is oppressive to women.</text>
