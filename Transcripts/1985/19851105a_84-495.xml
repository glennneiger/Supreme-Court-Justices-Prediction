            <text syncTime="14.433" offset="188172">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal is from a decision of the Third Circuit, which in reviewing a preliminary injunction ruling struck down numerous provisions of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.426" offset="252120">The case presents a variety of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.956" offset="266226">First, the Court must decide whether an appeal lies from a decision of a Court of Appeals which strikes down state statutes as unconstitutional but which remands for further proceedings on additional constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.608" offset="324845">Next, the Court must determine whether the Court of Appeals' substantive rulings were consistent with this Court's recent decisions on the permissible scope of abortion regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.773" offset="377508">And finally, even if the Court finds that the Court of Appeals properly applied the law to the limited record before it, the Court must decide whether it was appropriate for the Court of Appeals to finally declare these provisions of state law unconstitutional before the state has been given a fair opportunity to present evidence in defense of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.463" offset="688261">It is our understanding until the Court issues an order dismissing him that he is still a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.164" offset="703098">Now, before reaching the questions presented to the Court this morning, I would like to sketch very briefly the procedural history of the case, which is relevant to the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.206" offset="751268">The statute was passed in June of 1982, and it was not until October that this lawsuit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.532" offset="776554">About one month later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, and they attached to this motion 40 detailed affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.356" offset="811872">On November 18th of 1982, the District Court issued a procedural order to govern the hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction, and as a part of this order, the District Court directed the parties to agree on stipulations, and also prohibited any party from contesting any fact at the hearing unless that party had positive evidence to offer in support of that particular fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.706" offset="909256">So, stipulations were agreed upon, but they were agreed upon solely for the purposes of the preliminary injunction hearing, and they were largely drawn from the allegations of the complaint and the complainant's affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.404" offset="960038">The District Court with one minor exception denied the preliminary injunction, and after lengthy consideration, the Court of Appeals struck down numerous provisions of Pennsylvania's statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.993" offset="1010403">First, the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.164" offset="1023150">As I said, the question is whether or not an appeal lies to this Court from a decision of a Court of Appeals striking down some provisions of state law but remanding to the District Court for further proceedings on additional constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.375" offset="1087934">The appeal statute does not expressly require that to be appealable a decision of a court of appeals must finally dispose of all constitutional issues, and in fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="251.355" offset="1135895">You mean 1254 when you say that?</text>

            <text syncTime="275.751" offset="1233488">Well, to the extent you base your argument on it at all, what does that do with 1254(1), which allows cert, as you know, before or after rendition of a judgment or decree?</text>

            <text syncTime="298.867" offset="1325962">Well, I know, and 1254(1) obviously applies to the broader range of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.366" offset="1347905">I don't think the Court has ever held for cert that there need be a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.192" offset="1367235">I think it is entirely consistent, and in fact the original version of the statute enacted in 1925 from which 1254(1) and 1254(2) are derived were worded similarly and very broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.434" offset="1432228">Namely, both of those sections, and more particularly the predecessor of 1254(2), provided for an appeal in any case in a Court of Appeals if the decision was against the constitutionality of the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.366" offset="1491892">And certainly the decision under review here satisfies those general requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.053" offset="1514670">The decision... the case was properly in the Court of Appeals, and the decision was against the constitutionality of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.517" offset="3276473">Now, just to finish up the jurisdictional point, it is our position that this interest that Congress recognized in the appeals statute is as surely damaged by an interim decision such as this one as it is by a final one, and it requires that cases such as this one be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.634" offset="3340943">We request the Court to take jurisdiction over this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.476" offset="3360378">The Court has recognized that a woman in appropriate circumstances is entitled to have an abortion free from state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.425" offset="3400189">But at the same time the Court has held repeatedly that there is a permissible role for the states to play in ensuring the protection of maternal health and life.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.546" offset="3440626">In passing the statute under review here, the Pennsylvania legislature attempted to strike the balance which this Court has mandated in its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.980" offset="3474376">In some respects, based upon subsequent decisions of this Court, the legislature misstepped, and so we conceded the invalidity of several provisions of the Act while we were still in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.616" offset="3524950">But as to the provisions that we have brought to the Court this morning, the legislature clearly showed a proper regard for the rules which this Court has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.361" offset="3567895">For example, the Pennsylvania statute provides that a second physician should be present at abortions performed after viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.999" offset="3602481">Now, it is common ground among the parties that the state may require that a second physician be present, and the parties also agree that there must be an exception to this requirement if an emergency prevents the attendance of a second physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.679" offset="3661204">We differ only on whether this statute contains such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.147" offset="3679072">In our view, a view shared by Chief Judge Sikes below, the statute clearly provides for such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.237" offset="3707389">It is a complete defense to any charge brought under the section of which the second physician requirement is a part that the abortion was necessary to preserve maternal life or health.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.482" offset="3760365">This exception is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.325" offset="3767784">It is far plainer than the one which was found by the Court to be acceptable in the Ashcroft case, and so this provision clearly should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.711" offset="3805296">Next, the informed consent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.476" offset="3820342">The notion that patients are entitled to relevant information before submitting to a course of medical treatment is well accepted in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.750" offset="3901426">The informed consent provision is Section 3205 of Pennsylvania statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.233" offset="3919398">As I mentioned, the doctrine of informed consent has been developed by the courts and the legislatures to protect the patient, and the Court has recognized that this requirement may be extended to the abortion procedure, that women are entitled to know what will be done, the consequences of their choice, and the alternatives to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.771" offset="4009573">In fact, the Court has indicated more recently in the Affrin case and by way of a summary affirmance regarding Pennsylvania's prior statute that a state permissibly may set forth general requirements, categories of information which must be given to a woman to ensure her informed consent, and there is a very real need for this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.636" offset="4108943">The Pennsylvania legislature specifically found and the evidence revealed that women, despite existing requirements for informed consent, are not always being provided with relevant information, and it has been reported that some clinics encourage women to undergo abortion by withholding information which might cause them to bear the child to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.237" offset="4203402">The Pennsylvania statute does not put words in the mouth of the counselor or the physician, and it describes only in general terms the information which should be offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.451" offset="4244257">It contains no parade of horribles, no statements of dubious validity, and it gives doctors and counselors the room they need to tailor the exchange to the needs of each individual patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.508" offset="4292427">These requirements hardly erect an unconstitutional obstacle to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.788" offset="4313638">Next, the reporting requirements which are found in Section 3214 of Pennsylvania's statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.035" offset="4342582">These reports which are described in the statute are easily completed, and there has been no showing that the minimal effort required to complete these forms translates into a restriction on abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.560" offset="4400678">The reporting of data on abortions plainly serves important health interests by advancing the study of this medical procedure, and there is no serious contest over the relevance of this information, much of which already is reported to federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.334" offset="4463790">Of course, if this information is to be of any value in research, it must be available to researchers who are studying this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.534" offset="4496600">And the statute adequately protects confidentiality by deleting the names of the patient and the doctor and providing severe penalties for unauthorized disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.545" offset="4544665">Next, Pennsylvania in Section 3206 of the statute has provisions which require minors to obtain parental consent or judicial approval for abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.056" offset="4590641">Pennsylvania's statute clearly satisfies the general requirements which this Court has prescribed in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.288" offset="4623555">Now, appellees argued in the Court of Appeals that the statute is too general, and that it must be augmented by procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.442" offset="4652185">In the absence of such rules, the Court of Appeals accepted this argument and enjoined the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.249" offset="4675487">Since that time, rules have been issued, and yet appellees continue their attack on the statute, an attack which in some respects is similar to the one they presented below, and in other respects has shifted focus to take account of the new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.667" offset="4733061">But the essential question whether this statute is constitutional is still a live question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.305" offset="4763676">The specific inquiries have been altered somewhat by these new rules, but certainly the Court faces no insurmountable obstacle in addressing the appellee's facial complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.190" offset="4811219">All that is required in the way of procedure for a provision like this is that the minor be provided with an effective opportunity to obtain judicial approval, and these rules and the statute together provide as adequately as they can for quick, confidential proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.324" offset="4887705">They do not, as the appellees suggest, permit parental involvement in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.433" offset="4908185">The state courts are given authority to appoint counsel, to appoint a guardian, but are left with their traditional discretion in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.116" offset="4938905">This statute is plainly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.709" offset="4953325">It is an important provision, and it should be permitted to go into effect immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.081" offset="4970775">The final provision of Pennsylvania's statute which is before the Court involves the choice of abortion technique or method which must he used during abortions performed after viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.655" offset="5021034">This statute provides limited protection to the viable fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.075" offset="5038693">It requires that after viability the doctor used the abortion technique which is least risky to the fetus unless that technique would pose a significantly greater risk to the life or the health of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.615" offset="5104940">We do not argue that the state may require that a woman sacrifice her life or health to preserve the chances for survival of the fetus, and in our view this statute, by using the phrase "significantly greater risk", does no more than use a term which is familiar to physicians and researchers in this field, namely, a difference in relative risk that is statistically or scientifically meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.290" offset="5219565">In all research, statistical experts, medical researchers recognize that even under the best of circumstances, under the best design test, there may be differences in relative risk which are not scientifically or medically meaningful, and this statute does no more than recognize this common understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.936" offset="5314233">For these reasons and those outlined at greater length in our brief, the conclusions of the Court of Appeals were plainly incorrect, and they should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.449" offset="5356238">But even if the Court decides that the Court of Appeals properly applied the law to the limited record before it, it was inappropriate for the Court finally to declare these provisions of state law unconstitutional before the state has been given a fair opportunity to present evidence in support of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.175" offset="5435127">At the very least, the decision should be vacated and any order limited to a preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.949" offset="5506285">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on at least 12 occasions since 1973 this Court has been called upon to define the scope of a woman's fundamental right to choose abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.131" offset="5562918">Only two years ago this Court decided Akron and Ashcroft, and forcefully reaffirmed the landmark case of Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.816" offset="5593743">If this Court reaches the merits, the parties agree that the sound constitutional principles in Akron and Roe and all of the cases following it are controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.435" offset="5636166">Before addressing the merits, however, I will first address the question of this Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.153" offset="5659049">Appellants concede that this case is interlocutory, that it arose as an appeal from the ruling on a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.773" offset="5693531">Appellants also concede in their briefs that finality has always been the prerequisite to the mandatory appeal jurisdiction of this Court under Section 1254(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.411" offset="5736058">With no support and precedent, the Commonwealth asked the Court to reject a rule that has been an integral part of appeal practice throughout this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.719" offset="5777332">Although Congress has narrowed the scope of the appeal statutes several times in the last 60 years, it has never modified Section 1254(2) to disturb the finality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.806" offset="5833652">If there is a need to change this finality rule, Congress can and will do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.319" offset="5871686">Your Honor, it does not, but in 1891, in a case called MacLeish versus Roth, this Court found that the absence of the word "finality" did not mean that finality was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.985" offset="5922363">This Court applied the finality rule to appeal statutes, and Congress knew that when passing this Section 240 which was the predecessor to Section 1254(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.873" offset="5965936">Since that time, this Court has specifically applied finality to the Section 1254(2) and this Court has never retreated from those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.944" offset="6018181">The importance of the finality rule is really very well demonstrated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.786" offset="6037616">Given its piecemeal nature, it is very possible that this case could come before the Court at least twice and possibly three to four times if appellant's argument is to hold weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.704" offset="6873221">--Your Honor, this Court has long distinguished Section 1254(2) from Section 1252, which was the Walters case, and in fact 1252 does contain explicit language that allows both appeals from final orders and appeals from interlocutory orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.664" offset="6949080">We believe that the appeal provisions have been treated differently, basically because in the Walters situation there was an appeal from a finding that a federal statute was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.031" offset="7042598">Appellees rely on our briefs for the parental consent and the second doctor requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.105" offset="7066840">Pennsylvania makes it a felony to perform a post-viability abortion unless it is necessary to protect a woman's life or health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.883" offset="7101949">This prohibition is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.866" offset="7113861">What is at issue is additional standards, additional standard of care requirements and choice of abortion methods that are imposed on a very small class of women who have life or health-threatening problems that force the termination of pregnancy at this late stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.594" offset="7188780">Post-viability abortions are extremely rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.093" offset="7202781">They are performed on women who desperately want to have their children, but unfortunately due to some kind of underlying medical disease or pregnancy-related disease are forced to terminate the pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.180" offset="7251160">Under threat of criminal sanction, the Pennsylvania statute requires two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.803" offset="7273625">First, it requires the physician to use the standard of care that he would use as if the fetus were to be born prematurely rather than being aborted, regardless of the consequences to the woman's health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.268" offset="7319496">Second, the physician must use the abortion technique most likely to result in a live born fetus unless that technique would cause a significantly greater medical risk to the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.715" offset="7373309">Now, as found by the Court of Appeals, the significantly greater language on its face directly intrudes upon the ability of a physician to give his primary allegiance to his patient, that is, the woman, and forces the physician to trade off the woman's best medical care in order to only marginally increase the chance of fetal survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.378" offset="7467976">The Commonwealth concedes that such a trade-off is impermissible, but they ask this Court to delete the word "significantly" in order to cure the constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.935" offset="7522207">To do that, to delete the word "significantly", this Court would be forced to rewrite the statute, and we do not believe that the Court can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.650" offset="7553031">But the statute, even if the word "significantly" were deleted, contains other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.350" offset="7575810">It requires doctors to compare risks of differing abortion methods that are impossible to compare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.894" offset="7606007">For example, a physician could use a prostaglandin method or a saline method on a woman who had diabetes or who had hypertension or combined, which is frequently the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.015" offset="7658461">Each method carries approximately the same risk of mortality in a mathematical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.962" offset="7694301">The prostaglandin method, however, will increase the risk of stroke, and the saline method would increase the risk of uncontrolled diabetes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.961" offset="7726275">What the doctor is required to do here is to compare those two risks, to say is the risk of stroke a significantly greater medical risk than the risk of uncontrolled diabetes, and it is that comparison that is impossible to make, especially without consulting his patient as to which risk she is likely or wanting to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.374" offset="7815927">The question then becomes as a result of the statutory language, the vague language, and the impossibility of the judgment that the doctor is required to make what is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.335" offset="7871830">It is our belief that criminal sanctions are likely to produce one of two results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.428" offset="7892205">Either the physician will not provide medical care in these circumstances for fear of criminal liability or the doctor will use the technique which is the most fetal saving to the detriment of women's health, and it is that problem, putting the doctor making these judgments, that is problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.390" offset="7960019">Moreover, and I think this is an important point, the prostaglandin method or the saline, in choosing between the two methods, although the prostaglandin method is a little less fetal toxic than the saline method, that does not change the fact that both methods are extremely likely to cause the death of a fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.896" offset="8049985">So that to inject that criteria as a critical factor in deciding which method to use makes no medical sense and therefore puts the... and puts the physician into threat of criminal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.795" offset="8125635">Like the statute found... also like the statute found invalid under the Colautti decision, the standard of care requirement which is independent of the choice of method requirement contains no life or health exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.632" offset="8184985">It therefore compels the physician to treat a woman already suffering from serious health problems as if she were perfectly healthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.973" offset="8218318">For example, steroids often given to women in the late stages of pregnancy when they go into very premature labor in order to increase fetal lung capacity and improve the chance or the likelihood of fetal survival, this kind of treatment is contraindicated to women who suffer severe diseases, and in fact would be contraindicated for many of the women who are needing this kind of treatment, who are needing the abortion in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.898" offset="8333988">The statute, however, has no exception for the life or health of the mother, and therefore requires the physician to provide medical care in a manner that is contrary to his best judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.581" offset="8384770">For these reasons, the standard of care and the choice of method requirements must be found unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.282" offset="8407549">Turning to the reporting requirements, the reporting requirements contained in the Pennsylvania Act are unprecedented in their scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.840" offset="8449763">They under pain of criminal sanction again require physicians to report over 40 different types of information, including the basis of the physician's own medical judgment about each individual woman who obtains an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.739" offset="8521443">In addition to the separate reports that must be filed, these reports must be open for public inspection and copying, particularly in this area where public disclosure is likely to result in an increase of violence, intimidation, and harassment directed against providers of abortion services, and thereby chilling the exercise of constitutional rights both to the woman and the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.322" offset="8627709">The reporting requirements cannot withstand scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.165" offset="8639098">These reports go way beyond those found constitutional by this Court in Danforth, recordkeeping requirements that were characterized there as approaching impermissible limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.458" offset="8684238">Given these burdens, the Commonwealth must show that there is a compelling state interest to justify the reporting requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.532" offset="8716525">This they haven't done and they cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.907" offset="8726034">In fact, the Pennsylvania Department of Health's past practice has shown that patient care may suffer if abortion providers and women are subjected to increased levels of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.557" offset="8776711">Indeed, when required to justify the reporting requirements and the public disclosure requirements of another section of this Act that was before the District Court on remand, the Commonwealth did not assert a public health interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.800" offset="8841599">Rather, they argued that such disclosure was justified because it advanced first amendment rights of protestors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.986" offset="8874409">Even the Centers for Disease Control which in their briefs the Commonwealth acknowledges to be the leading public agency in the collection of health data is able to use aggregate reports that adequately protect the confidentiality of both the doctors and the women involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.739" offset="8993423">As a result of the Court of Appeals injunction on these provisions and a subsequent injunction by the District Court as to other provisions, the reports have not become public, and earlier Pennsylvania law which I may say satisfied the CDC requirements for health data kept the reports totally confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.605" offset="9080881">So, to my knowledge, in Pennsylvania no malpractice claims have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.414" offset="9100107">There have, however, been a number of cases around the country where women's identities have been disclosed through reports, either in hospitals or through information that has been collected by opponents of abortion outside abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.580" offset="9160711">For example, opponents have taken pictures of women entering clinics, copied down license plate numbers, and tried to track down individual women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.312" offset="9191640">As a result of that, there have been many suits that have been brought, not many, but several suits that have been brought to try to sue the opponents of abortion for those practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.020" offset="9294563">The reports under Section 3207 and 3214F which were the subject of the lower court proceedings after remand which involved corporate identification and the number of abortions performed per trimester are being kept but they are under order to be no public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.713" offset="9385260">The reporting requirements, as I said, therefore must be held invalid, and I would like to turn quickly to the informed consent requirements in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.099" offset="9434788">The Court of Appeals decision finding the informed consent provisions of the Pennsylvania law unconstitutional must be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.863" offset="9465926">To do so, the Court need only apply the Akron decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.282" offset="9479614">During the course of this litigation, after the Court decided the Akron decision, the Commonwealth conceded the unconstitutionality of both the 24-hour waiting period and the doctor only counseling requirements which are contained in Section 3205, the very provision that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.571" offset="9556727">Because the section is not severable, like the ordinance in Akron, the entire informed consent provisions must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.943" offset="9586194">The specific informational requirements, however, are invalid in their own right for the same two equally decisive reasons that this Court condemned the Akron ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.282" offset="9635617">First, the information is designed not to inform a woman but to persuade her to withhold her consent altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.483" offset="9660381">And second, the statute prohibits the physician from specifically tailoring the informed consent dialogue to the needs of the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.494" offset="9692460">Now, counsel for the appellants this morning said, well, the doctor is free to tailor the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.320" offset="9715761">The statute does not say that anywhere within it, and that under the ruling in Akron is an equally decisive reason for striking down these provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.770" offset="9905514">Your Honor, it is our view that to tell the woman that the father is liable for support, given the national crisis in the collection of child support enforcement orders that Congress has recognized, and the difficulty in the collecting of support may in many cases be misleading, but in addition to inform that, to use... to provide that information to certain women, such as a rape victim who must be informed that her assailant is liable for the support of her child if she carries the pregnancy to term can be extremely cruel and traumatic in that situation, and may force her to relive that trauma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.443" offset="10052218">It is those very situations that that information may not be appropriate at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.128" offset="10074997">It is our view that the statute must allow the physician to tailor the information to the specific needs of this patient, and he can't do that, or the counselor can't do that given the mandates of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.920" offset="10126092">The statute, as I said, is both cruel and inaccurate in some situations, and misleading, and also requires the provision of irrelevant information which can harm the health of the woman in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.382" offset="10203937">Let me give you another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.757" offset="10209475">Informing a woman that there are unforeseeable risks to an abortion is an inaccurate statement given that abortion is the most studied medical procedure in American medicine today, and can only be intended by the legislature to arouse unwarranted fears of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.716" offset="10293276">In addition, it is irrelevant to provide information such that medical assistance payments are available or information that the state strongly urges the woman to contact particular agencies and consult private social agencies that are run by opponents of abortion in situations where the woman needs the abortion in order to protect her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.362" offset="10395885">In those circumstances not only is it irrelevant, but it could be harmful to the woman's health, and the facts in the record do show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.703" offset="10425247">Accordingly, the informed consent provisions must be held in invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.420" offset="10444159">In conclusion, the Pennsylvania Act constitutionally infringes on the rights of women in consultation with their physicians to make critical decisions about abortion and to interfere with women's ability to control their own lives and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.195" offset="10507271">It has been argued to this Court that the controversy surrounding the abortion issues requires a retreat from the principles both espoused by this Court in Rowe and reaffirmed most recently in Akron, yet it is precisely this controversy that compels a clear and unwaivering dedication to those sound and fundamental principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.029" offset="10590550">This Court's steadfast adherence to Rowe and Akron is the only way to guarantee the protection of the cherished individual liberties at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.010" offset="10626494">Accordingly, FOE has asked this Court to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction, or in the alternative to affirm the ruling of the Court of Appeals.</text>
