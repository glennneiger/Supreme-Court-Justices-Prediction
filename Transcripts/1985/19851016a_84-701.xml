            <label>Ms. Kathryn Anne Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="80.889" offset="462882">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether Riverside's property is wetland subject to the Corps of Engineers permit jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.790" offset="522442">The Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into waters of the United States without a permit, and the Act further defines dredge and fill material as a pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.394" offset="568940">In this case, Riverside began filling without a permit in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.032" offset="591509">The Corps issued a cease and desist order which Riverside ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.234" offset="608228">The United States obtained a temporary restraining order from the District Court which Riverside also ignored, and eventually the District Court held Riverside in contempt of court, and ultimately the District Court at the time Judge Kennedy issued a preliminary injunction in joining Riverside from further filling activity on its property absent a permit from the Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.335" offset="700701">Riverside appealed, but in the meantime the regulations defining wetlands had been changed, and so the United States asked that the case be remanded to the District Court to consider the effect of the new regulations on the facts of this case, and on remand, Judge Gilmore, who by this time the case had been reassigned to, applied the facts as found by Judge Kennedy in her lengthy trial to the new regulations, and found again that Riverside's property was a wetland within the Corps' jurisdiction, and again entered a permanent injunction prohibiting Riverside from filling without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.099" offset="859735">On Riverside's second appeal, the Sixth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.739" offset="878334">In its initial opinion, the Court based its decision on its interpretation of the Corps' revised regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.798" offset="906546">The court interpreted the language in the regulations, which we have quoted in our brief, that relates to ground water saturation as being basically irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.106" offset="947715">The way the court treated it as irrelevant was by... to not quote it every time the court mentioned the new regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.260" offset="976345">Instead, the court concluded that the new regulations under which this case was now to be decided required that any wetland vegetation on a piece of property be caused, actually caused by what the Court of Appeals called frequent flooding, which does not appear in the regulations anywhere, frequent flooding from adjacent navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.204" offset="1068192">Essentially what the court was doing in our opinion was reinstating a requirement in the 1975 regulations for periodic inundation that had been eliminated and was the basis for the United States' motion that the case be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration under the revised regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.446" offset="1141126">Even though the government thought that the Court of Appeals panel opinion had misinterpreted the regulations, we also thought initially that this was perhaps something the government could have corrected administratively by simply issuing revised or clarified regulations explaining that this was never the intent of the regulations, and that could have solved the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.999" offset="1231300">Ms. Oberly, may I inquire, in your reply brief it seemed to me that for the first time the government was saying that the land in this case is connected by open water to a navigable river of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.211" offset="1300159">So is the position you are now taking that there is a direct surface connection between the land at issue here and the navigable waters?</text>

            <text syncTime="304.846" offset="1358673">Well, why, then, didn't the Corps just show that surface connection before the District Court and not bother with subsurface connections?</text>

            <text syncTime="323.260" offset="1432339">I don't think, again, in all fairness to everybody concerned, but at the time of the trial, anybody knew exactly what they were doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.352" offset="1460760">Well, it does seem to me that if the theory that you now assert is correct, that there is a direct surface connection to navigable water, that the case is substantially--</text>

            <text syncTime="341.284" offset="1504437">I think that much, if not all of what went on before Judge Kennedy was irrelevant, which was the reason why when the case first came up on appeal, the United States moved for the remand, from the Court of Appeals back to the District Court, and it was our intention that these irrelevancies which comprise about 90 percent of the District Court record in our view would be just completely set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.447" offset="1593149">We would start over with a clean slate, try the case properly, and we were always certain as in fact turned out to be the case, that the United States would and should win this case under the new regulations as well as under the old ones, but our hope was to sweep away what had really diverted everybody's--</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.783" offset="4498487">And therefore the chemicals that people put on their lawns here to fertilize their lawns are going to wash in this direction every time it rains, but because there is a wetland here filled with wetland vegetation, that vegetation traps the chemicals and other sediment that would otherwise wash into the open water bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.899" offset="4582915">And basically what the wetland does is provide a free water treatment plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.399" offset="6512946">But it affirmatively left unchanged the waters and wetlands that are covered by the Act, and when I say that we know it is not just waters, it is also wetlands, I did refer you to Section 404(g), because what Section 404(g) does is establish a mechanism whereby states who qualify can take over the Section 404 permit program and administer it in lieu of the Corps of Engineers upon showing that they have adequate authority, but they are never under any circumstances... a state may never take over the 404 program insofar as it applies to traditional navigable waters and their adjacent wetlands, and that is spelled out exactly, precisely the way I have said it in Section 404(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.020" offset="6699460">So, here, going back to this wetland, the map in the back of the reply brief, we have a wetland that Michigan would never be allowed to regulate because it falls within the category of wetlands that Congress and the Corps of Engineers both deem the most important to the national interest, and therefore not subject or suitable for delegation to local control, and again, I come back to the point that our concern is not just this wetland or even just the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.664" offset="6822027">Our concern is, if the Sixth Circuit is upheld, this is the one category of wetland that we know for sure Congress wanted to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.708" offset="6854210">We know that by the language of Section 404(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.317" offset="6864554">And if this wetland is held to be by this Court, or if the Sixth Circuit is affirmed, outside of the Corps' jurisdiction, than there are no wetlands, isolated or whatever adjective you might use, that are covered at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.596" offset="8641717">I think the argument just doesn't square with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.718" offset="8658226">The point is that Judge Kennedy made critical findings on the relationship of this land to any water body, both surface and subsurface.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.512" offset="8701380">The government maintains that she had no evidence before her concerning surface conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.789" offset="8734504">She was able to see what was going on, and she made findings with respect to the hydrologic connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.036" offset="8759477">There is no suggestion that she limited her findings to only an underwater connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.066" offset="8783614">She did find that the type of soils that were on the property could not transmit, or it was so impervious that water would not move more than 50 feet through it, and on that basis concluded that soils were not saturated because of the relationship or proximity to any water body, the nearest water body being more than 200 feet away, and that was a canal that ultimately flowed into Black Creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.461" offset="8881207">The point is, this is an isolated wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.928" offset="8899075">It is an area that is unconnected by either ground water or surface water to any water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.599" offset="8917674">It does possess poor drainage, and that is the reason why the wetland type vegetation was growing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.019" offset="8943379">This was the basis of her findings, and those findings were relied upon by the Court of Appeals in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.234" offset="8976293">The government before the Court of Appeals and its petition here, and I guess up until the time of its reply brief, was maintaining that any land such as Riverside's which possesses wet soils or any reason, and those soils accommodate the growth of trees and other vegetation that are tolerant of wet conditions is a wetland which in turn means it is a navigable water, and regulated under the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.752" offset="9106383">And this is so, contended the Government, irregardless, irrespective of the relationship of this land to a water body, or any connection, either subsurface or surface connection, just as long as there was some other water body in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.573" offset="9181615">We think that the Court of Appeals was correct in rejecting this construction of the phrase "navigable waters".</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.525" offset="9365413">Congress in adopting the 1972 amendments, had something specific in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.803" offset="9390491">And what it had in mind was the fact that prior efforts at water pollution control had been restricted principally by agencies such as the Corps of Engineers, who had refused to exercise jurisdiction over any water bodies other than waters that crossed state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.669" offset="9470007">As a result, Congress in 1972 sought to correct what it perceived to be a severe limitation, and to in essence follow cases decided by this Court concerning the definition of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.052" offset="9543568">The legislative history, and in particular the conference report to the 1972 amendments, is very clear on saying what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.751" offset="9582334">It referred to cases of this Court, and then stated that it was intending to bring within the Clean Water Act's regulatory scheme navigable waters that were used in interstate commerce, their tributaries, as long as they were connected to interstate commerce, and then articulated that there could either be a connection through use of those waters in interstate commerce or if the waters ultimately connected to some other method of interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.779" offset="9774491">The Act does regulate that, Your Honor, under Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.089" offset="9791731">If a pollutant ultimately ends up in a navigable water, it is subject to regulation under Section 402 as a point discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.164" offset="9827989">What we have here is attempting to define the area where that pollutant may come from if it is a wetland, and being a navigable water itself, in instances where there is absolutely no connection between that wetland and the water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.189" offset="9892042">So in answer to your question, Congress was concerned, and it is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.907" offset="9906984">Under the government's construction of the Act, something in the neighborhood of 100 million acres of wetlands will be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.604" offset="9953795">We find this to be really not credible to say that Congress intended to regulate this acreage, which is the size of the state of California, without ever having mentioned that fact in either the Act or the legislative history when it adopted it in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.207" offset="10028192">This is not to say that the Clean Water Act does not regulate wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.127" offset="10051806">The government's statement that no wetlands will be regulated is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.124" offset="10071869">For example, tidal wetlands are regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.106" offset="10087751">They are inundated by waters of the United States, or navigable waters, and come within the purview of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.760" offset="10114396">As a result, the tidal wetlands that border the Chesapeake Bay or San Francisco Bay or tidal areas in Florida come within the regulatory scheme of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.382" offset="10156819">In a like fashion, those wetlands that are a part of or are regularly inundated by lakes and rivers also are regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.392" offset="10192868">What is not regulated are those types of lands such as Riverside's which have no water connection, surface water connection to a water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.155" offset="10239993">Congress did not intend to bring that type of area within the regulatory scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.213" offset="10264234">The government in its briefs, at least, argues that in 1977, Congress's refusal to adopt amendments that would have severely restricted the definition of navigable waters should be equated to a legislative endorsement of the Corps' 1977 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.390" offset="10372904">First off, the 1977 regulations were first promulgated the same day that the bill that amended the 1977 Act was introduced into Congress, and the language as far as these provisions were concerned did not change, so unless Congress is more clairvoyant than I believe it to be, it didn't even know what those 77 regulations were at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.191" offset="10480110">They certainly didn't know what the Corps was contemplating to do in the future in furtherance of those regulations, but more importantly, Congress did not change the definition of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.468" offset="10537162">What it did was to reject a proposed amendment that would have placed the regulation of navigable waters back to where it had been prior to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.509" offset="10585331">In doing that, I don't think that it is appropriate to read into Congress's inaction a positive finding in affirmance of the Corps' conduct as manifested by its 1977 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.863" offset="10650742">This Court has consistently held that a failure of Congress to act is not tantamount to a manifestation of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.795" offset="10694523">And we see no reason why that doctrine should be departed from in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.277" offset="10716466">I would also note that in the legislative history to the 1977 legislative effort, Congress again restated what it thought it had done in 1972, and that was to regulate not only navigable waters, but also tributaries of those waters and intrastate waters that were navigable in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.907" offset="10818971">That is consistent with what the legislative history surrounding the 1972 effort stated, and we see that Congress really was doing nothing different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.528" offset="10873410">It was just restating what it originally intended, which is to get out from under the restrictive definitions of navigable waters that the Corps of Engineers had administratively employed prior to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.117" offset="10927849">The government in its briefs had argued that one of the purposes of the Clean Water Act was to prevent the conversion of any wetlands to any other use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.219" offset="10996185">This has been in essence the foundation upon which it has been urging a liberal construction of the term navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.543" offset="11029518">One of the problems with this contention is that if the goal is to prevent the conversion of wetlands to any other use, the most common methods of converting wetlands to other uses are not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.257" offset="11092316">For example, draining wetlands, dredging or digging up wetlands as long as you don't put the dredge spoils on the wetlands themselves, removing vegetation from wetlands, and burning wetlands are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.813" offset="11146546">In fact, the 1984 Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Report on the Status of Wetlands pointed out that since 1950, only 6 percent of the wetland conversions that had occurred occurred through urbanization and methods such as filling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.243" offset="11220316">The remaining 94 percent had occurred through methods that were unregulated and are unregulated by the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.990" offset="11251245">The point is that the Clean Water Act was not designed to be a wetland protection statute insofar as isolated areas are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.860" offset="11298788">It was an act designed to prevent the pollution of the nation's waters, and by defining navigable waters in the Act, Congress intended to include navigable waters, non-navigable tributaries of those waters, and non-navigable portions of those water bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.948" offset="11363153">It intended to eliminate requirements that the waters cross state lines, and it also intended to abandon the requirement that the activity occur below the ordinary high water line, and would permit regulation as far as the water body extended, in other words, as far as the surface waters flowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.502" offset="11441312">That is what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.752" offset="11450298">That is what it stated it intended to do, and in our opinion that is what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.531" offset="11469420">The Court of Appeals in reading the Act arrived at the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.856" offset="11490735">It concluded, and I think very reasonably so, that the term navigable waters as used in the Act does not mean that land that becomes wet and has no relationship to any water body.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.181" offset="12132094">Congress has struggled with this, how to regulate ground water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.446" offset="12141080">Fortunately, here we don't have that factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.991" offset="12159261">The findings are that there was no underground connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.052" offset="12171486">The second problem from our perspective of the government's position is that once you depart from the requirement of the surface connection, there really is no limit to how far away from a navigable water an area can be and still be treated as a navigable water within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.057" offset="12267513">The adjacency requirement that is in the regulations was originally, in our opinion, inserted to describe those areas that were inundated by that water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.226" offset="12312234">But the government has abandoned that requirement in the 1977 regulations, and is now moving away from the water body, and we just don't know how far away they intend to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.799" offset="12362494">We have heard in their reply brief that all that is necessary is some sort of aerial relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.905" offset="12386944">We don't know what that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.920" offset="12398961">One thing for certain, however, is that that type of aerial relationship offers no objective criteria by which a landowner can determine whether or not his property is subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.616" offset="12477746">I suppose it a fortiori would be contrary to the statute in your view to attempt to regulate that kind of a wetland.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar B. Washburn</label>
            <text syncTime="3092.721" offset="12510242">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.376" offset="12516825">If the relationship is something other than a water connection, surface water connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.734" offset="12538246">The government in its final pages of its brief seems to say that landowners should not be concerned about the indefiniteness and imprecise nature and perhaps even difficulties of determining whether or not their property is subject to regulation, because all that is needed is to engage in the permit procedure where everything can be worked out administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.300" offset="12664574">In the government's words, jurisdictional rules are of limited utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.657" offset="12689965">Well, they may be of limited utility from the perspective of the Corps of Engineers, but it is certainly not from a landowner's perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.732" offset="12722252">The process is time consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.996" offset="12731343">It is expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.231" offset="12736254">And it is uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.964" offset="12743150">The permit most likely will be denied, or if it is granted, it will be granted with conditions that require the provision of what is called mitigation, and in this instance, under the present regulations of the Corps and the EPA, litigation is construed as meaning that there should be no net loss of wetland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.392" offset="12832907">As a result, if a landowner such as Riverside is to secure a permit to fill ten acres, Riverside must acquire ten acres of non-wetlands, convert them to a wetland, and then give it to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.886" offset="12886824">The point is that from the landowner's point of view, the jurisdictional determination is the critical determination, for once jurisdiction attaches, all sorts of bad things begin to happen from the landowner's perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.927" offset="12951085">We think that landowners are entitled to a boundary that not only comports with the meaning of the Clean Water Act, and that is, it is limited to navigable waters and those areas that are connected to them by a surface water connection, but also that the agencies implementing that Act use objective criteria by which that particular boundary can be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.619" offset="13065815">In this instance, the Corps' regulations satisfies neither requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.273" offset="13088384">It is out of compliance with the Act, and it offers no objective criteria by which a landowner can gauge his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.503" offset="13121299">I might add finally, and this is particularly appropriate in the state of Michigan, that wetlands, even isolated wetlands, are not unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.093" offset="13167692">As I pointed out earlier, many wetlands are presently covered by the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.233" offset="13188277">States such as Michigan also possess their own wetland regulatory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.558" offset="13209593">Michigan, for example, has a scheme that does regulate isolated wetlands under the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.166" offset="13236029">We think that is where wetland regulation should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.008" offset="13247313">We think there is no need for the courts to construe the Clean Water Act in a fashion that will basically amend the Act to be one of wetland protection when that was not Congress's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.892" offset="13306873">In other words, there is neither a need nor a necessity for that type of interpretation to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.092" offset="13335712">Unless there are any further questions, that concludes my presentation.</text>
