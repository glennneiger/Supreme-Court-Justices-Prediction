            <text syncTime="94.572" offset="510235">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="98.606" offset="526326">This is an appeal from a final judgment of the Seventh Circuit, an appeal brought by the intervening defendants in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.962" offset="563734">The first issue of the case is one that has been raised in the briefs about the standing of the intervening defendants to bring this appeal under the doctrine of case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.200" offset="612740">Three things happened below: There was a declaratory judgment; where was an injunction; and there was a judgment against the individual intervenors for $100,000 for legal fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.898" offset="659551">The liability for the judgment will be appealed to the Seventh Circuit, but the amount of the judgment can only be litigated here because it's intertwined with the issues in this case, that is to say, who is the prevailing party on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.836" offset="723290">If this Court reverses the Seventh Circuit, then the amount of the judgment will be lessened since they no longer are the prevailing parties on the issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.013" offset="759966">The standing or the real controversy thus between the parties to this case is a very real sum of money, a judgment that runs in favor of the individual plaintiff physicians in this case and against the individual defendants intervenors whom I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.786" offset="835094">They represent, therefore, a far greater stake, one might say, in the outcome of this case than the intervening appellants in Bryant versus Yellin, who were given standing to appeal on the basis of the water problem that existed in the Imperial Valley on the problem that existed in the Imperial Valley on the standing argument that they desired to purchase farmlands in the Imperial Valley if farmland should become available because of the application of 46 in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.097" offset="972289">No one was required to sell, but standing to appeal was nonetheless granted for purposes of the appeal on the mere probability that someone might sell below market depending upon the outcome of Section 46.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.156" offset="4260583">I think that's essential here in deciding its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.569" offset="4278242">In Maher, for example, this Court pointed out that a woman has at least an equal right to choose to carry her fetus to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.764" offset="4310947">The plaintiffs have raised in this Court for the first time an argument that the imposition of the statute does not accord with good medical practice or, another way of phrasing it, they say it requires false information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.746" offset="4374895">That's another issue that was not litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.816" offset="4383149">In their cite on page 17 they cite to Williams Obstetrics page 89.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.999" offset="4403943">A review of page 89 indicates, quite the contrary from the assertion of the argument, that the information that the State requires is accurate and factual and medically correct and in accord with medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.486" offset="4457860">The Seventh Circuit weighed heavily on the argument that this statute, when read with the other sections of the statute, required the physician to be the mouthpiece of the State as to a certain theory of life which it's not allowed to enunciate under Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.550" offset="4534137">And I may digress for one moment to point out that in this case here it is our contention there is no issue concerning Roe v. Wade, Ashcroft, Colautti, or any of the other cases, but that they are properly applied under our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.453" offset="4605713">The Seventh Circuit held that to fulfil the requirement of the statute the physician would have to talk about fetal death, and under the definition of fetal death it requires that he look to the definition of fetus, which means human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.874" offset="4683453">What the Seventh Circuit overlooked was that at the time it wrote the decision that section of the statute had been amended, Section 2-6, and it had been amended to read that</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.125" offset="4744475">"a fetus is an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.058" offset="4776135">which as far as I think humans can do is absolutely neutral on the issue of whether or not we're involved with a human being at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.747" offset="4826918">I think it was a rather significant omission by the court in arriving at that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.673" offset="4854607">There are two other sections of the statute, and I must refer to them as old 6-1 and old 6-4 because the statute was amended, and the new amendments we refer to as new 6-1 and new 6-4 to try to allay a little of the confusion that the amendments caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.377" offset="4937468">Incidentally, the Seventh Circuit found, and it's true, if one looks at the history of abortion legislation in the State of Illinois, the many amendments, the changes in the statute, the constantly going back to the legislature to do it over again, one would find out that they correlate pretty well with the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.681" offset="5022627">And many of the sections of this statute are the way they are because of the time that Ashcroft was passed and the State of Illinois was attempting to bring its law in conformity with Ashcroft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.959" offset="5071737">Our argument below, after notifying the Seventh Circuit of the change in the statute, was that the issues with regard to old 6-1 and old 6-4 were moot, primarily because the changes were substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.679" offset="5138611">The statute was narrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.578" offset="5142268">Different standards were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.831" offset="5151254">And that statute, new 6-1 and new 6-4, is the subject matter of a separate lawsuit called Keith versus Daley, which is being vigorously litigated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.069" offset="5204230">Extensive affidavits have been filed, briefs have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.234" offset="5224815">It is the subject matter of an agreed-to between the State and the litigants preliminary injunction, and is undertaking no activity until this case is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.219" offset="5272775">So new 6-1 and new 6-4 are in a separate lawsuit where the constitutionality of those statutes are being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.365" offset="5301406">Now, back to old 6-1 and old 6-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.018" offset="5379982">The Seventh Circuit addressed those statutes even though the challenge to them and the standing of the challenge to them was based upon the potentiality of future convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.305" offset="5413105">In fact, 6-4 had been enjoined from the day it was passed until the day it was amended out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.217" offset="5424808">6-1 was in existence for only eight months, so that when the Seventh Circuit dealt with this issue it held that, because of the possibility of future prosecutions against these physicians for the eight-month period of time several years prior, that that statute was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.580" offset="5506206">And it therefore held that the statute was not moot and reached the merits on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.793" offset="5527104">Our position is then and is now that under the teachings of this Court that statute was moot, ought not to have been addressed, or the Seventh Circuit ought to have remanded in the same case to consider the effect of the new amendments, which was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.313" offset="5597216">The plaintiffs chose, as is their right, to file a separate suit and litigate those issues separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.059" offset="5624175">The court would not consolidate the cases and therefore we had a bifurcated litigation going on, which ought not to have been the case but nonetheless was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.589" offset="10142313">It is intervenor, not the medical profession, who seeks to deceive women who need medically accurate information regarding birth control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.586" offset="10178258">Indeed, the patient information brochure which is required by federal regulation to be given to women contains medically accurate information regarding the health risks and consequences of IUD's, DES, and oral contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.465" offset="10237817">Contrary to 210 and 11(d), this federally mandated information clearly informs the woman that none of these drugs or devices will cause an abortion or terminate a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.203" offset="10284733">Moreover, the availability of this information to the woman undercuts intervenor's undocumented insinuations that the medical profession is engaged in wholesale deception of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.131" offset="10340426">Finally, intervenor's interpretation of this statute that physicians are free to use value-neutral language to comply with it is contrary to the express statutory language, ignores the coercive force of the criminal statute, and is inconsistent with the position advanced by intervenor in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.715" offset="10422764">The word "abortifacient" necessarily signifies an abortion, which necessarily presumes the existence of a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.342" offset="10453275">Surely this word will often need explanation, and just as surely physicians will avoid the possibility of prosecution by using the statutory explanation, "causing fetal death".</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.496" offset="10501863">Section 6-4 is directly contrary to this Court's prior holdings in Danforth and Colautti because it burdens the abortion decision and its effectuation prior to viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.287" offset="10561109">The fetal standard of care applies when the physician determines there exists a possibility of sustained survival, a possibility, not a reasonable likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.154" offset="10608547">A similar standard of care was found unconstitutional in Danforth because it applied prior to viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.481" offset="10637804">Likewise, this provision applies before there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival and must, for that reason, be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.395" offset="10677510">Intervenor's suggestion to the contrary is refuted by the existence of Section 6-1, which clearly applies after viability and establishes the same standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.873" offset="10719411">Also, their suggestion is controverted by the language of 6-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.908" offset="10743548">The 6-4 necessarily suggests that it applies to a time before viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.212" offset="10768730">Moreover, if there is any doubt on this question, then 6-4 is unconstitutionally vague under this Court's decision in Colautti, for according to intervenor this condition which the State is attempting to govern by Section 6-4 differs in some indeterminate way from viability as set forth by this Court in Roe and Danforth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.078" offset="10864233">Finally, as with Section 6-1, Section 6-4's standard of care is impermissibly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.002" offset="10895894">Turning then to Section 6-1, this is the post-viability standard of care provision, very much like the one in Danforth and very much like the one in Colautti.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.629" offset="10938421">It is vague in at least two ways, each of which is sufficient to sustain the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.763" offset="10962976">First, the statute does not clearly specify the attending physician's viability determination controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.607" offset="10990353">Second, the statute fails to inform the physician that the woman's life or health is preeminent to the fetus when they conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.994" offset="11027864">Turning to the first of these, this section, unlike Section 6-4, applies when the fetus is known to be viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.549" offset="11062137">This phrase was added after the district court in Wynn versus Scott had construed Section 6-1 to leave the viability determination to the attending physician's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.487" offset="11109889">Section 6-1 thus allows the State to question the correctness of the viability determination in a later criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.374" offset="11149386">Intervenor concedes that the State cannot constitutionally do so under Colautti, but argues instead that the "known to be" phrase means known by the attending physician to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.712" offset="11202780">Intervenor's construction is contrary to the express statutory language used by the legislature to limit the viability determination to the attending federal in Section 6-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.001" offset="11251891">Additionally, the intervenor construes the 6-1 than the meaning which he attributes to that phrase in the first sentence of 6-1, thereby illustrating the vagueness of that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.072" offset="11332243">Alternatively, if physicians and assistants are not bound by the physician's viability determination, chaos will occur as each assistant attempts to avoid criminal prosecution by acting contrary to the physician's instructions where the physician has determined that the fetus is not viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.620" offset="11430359">Women who receive post-viability abortions do so because their life or health is threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.523" offset="11458049">This statute does not clearly specify that the woman's life and health are preeminent from the decision of whether or not to have an abortion through its effectuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.903" offset="11511548">Contrary to intervenor's suggestion, this problem is not solved by Section 6-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.176" offset="11532655">Section 6-5 does not provide the protection of the woman's life and health which the intervenor claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.731" offset="11558882">Section 6-5 simply doesn't make the woman's life and health preeminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.914" offset="11579571">It applies by its own words only during the course of the pregnancy termination, a point after which the choice of abortion techniques has already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.300" offset="11625128">Choice of abortion technique, as this Court recognized in Colautti, is a complicated medical judgment, about which physicians can and do disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.442" offset="11681657">Intervenor's unsupported assertion that certain techniques were developed to injure fetuses ignores the fact that these same techniques reduce risks to women whose life and health is threatened in a post-viability abortion situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.780" offset="11743097">The distress to the fetus in this situation, the threat to the woman, the skills of the physician, and the varying side effects and complications of each of these techniques makes compliance with 6-1 impossible; and, as the uncontroverted affidavits state, 6-1 does not present to them a clear understanding of what physician conduct is considered criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.819" offset="11855215">Although the intervenor suggests to the contrary, the words 6-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.065" offset="11896175">Rather, Section 6-5 applies when the physician determines that to follow the dictates of Section 6-1 would cause increased medical risk to the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.033" offset="11936090">The difference in language necessarily creates vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.077" offset="11972243">Illinois uses the health and life standard to control the availability of post-viability abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.933" offset="11999620">By not using that standard in 6-5, it intended to somehow limit the factors which the physician had available to him to consider in deciding whether or not to apply the 6-1 standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.811" offset="12059179">A reaffirmance of Colautti's requirement that when fetal and maternal interests conflict the physician must be allowed to consider the woman's health and life preeminent in making post-viability abortion decisions is necessary because, if I may say so, some including Illinois have not followed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.466" offset="12153846">Starting with Griswold and most recently in Akron, this Court consistently has recognized the woman's right to personal autonomy in reproductive matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.057" offset="12216122">These prior decisions are dispositive of the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.500" offset="12229915">Sections 210 and 11(d) cannot be reconciled with Akron's prohibition of criminal regulation designed to deter reproductive choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.306" offset="12265128">Sections 6-1 and 6-4 cannot be reconciled with Colauti's prohibition of vague statutes that require trade-offs between a woman's health and that of the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.902" offset="12303580">None of the provisions can be reconciled with Roe's clear affirmation that the constitutional right of privacy cannot be vitiated by the State's theory of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.238" offset="12344854">For these reasons and those in our brief, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed or on the Article 3 point this appeal should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.027" offset="12388008">Unless the Court has any other questions, thank you.</text>
