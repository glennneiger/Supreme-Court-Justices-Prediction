          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="29.458">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142836">Mr. Thiede, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="brian_e_thiede" startTime="29.458" stopTime="254.680">
            <label>Mr. Brian E. Thiede</label>
            <text syncTime="29.458" offset="260596">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.035" offset="270940">I feel compelled to, at the beginning at least, reference why it is that we are here, the underlying circumstances, and that is that Mr. Rudy Bladel, in the City of Jackson, the State of Michigan, killed three people who happened to work for the railroad because he didn't like the railroad, not because he had any complaint with them, but they just happened to be railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.072" offset="371042">Mr. Jackson in the City or County of Wayne killed a Mr. Perry because Mr. Perry's wife didn't like him any more but wanted to collect the insurance money We have some very serious cases here, serious on the facts and serious to the people of the State of Michigan because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.127" offset="443244">Despite the fact that the motivations of the killings in these cases are different, they do present a common legal proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.046" offset="475009">That proposition was ruled on by the Michigan Supreme Court where they created what they thought to be an analogous rule to Edwards versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.400" offset="520358">Simply stated, the Michigan Supreme Court held that if a defendant, while at his initial appearance before a magistrate who has no jurisdiction to accept a final plea in the case, whose only job is ministerial, in other words to advise a defendant of the charge against him, set bond if bond is appropriate, and to advise him of his right to counsel and to get the administrative process going if he's indigent, the Michigan Supreme Court said if the defendant asked for appointed counsel at that stage, the police are forevermore precluded from initiating interrogation of that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.008" offset="686810">Reading the cases of this Court, it seems that there are two bases upon which this Court has excluded confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.551" offset="724949">One is, when there is some impingement on a constitutional right such as the Fifth Amendment setting or Henry and Brewer and cases like that where it's the Sixth Amendment, or in the alternative, where the confession itself is unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.794" offset="797987">I don't think either of those factors exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.370" offset="812302">There is simply no reason for the rule established by the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.259" offset="831842">As Justice White noted in, I believe Selum versus Stooms, the follow-up case on Edwards, in discussing its retroactivity, the Edwards rule has very little to do with the reliability of a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.333" offset="888162">It hasn't a real great deal to do with the truth telling process, because there remains at all times, apart from any per se rule, the ability of the defense to challenge the voluntariness, and that of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.919" offset="942496">So, the per se rule does not change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.106" offset="959215">It does not preclude the defendant from having an opportunity to challenge the reliability of the statement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.604" offset="981158">Edwards, however, did have the salutory effect of giving the defendant some security in that while asking for counsel during police interrogation, the police could no longer return and re-initiate interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.629" offset="1041344">That seems to be a logical result.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.769" offset="1049912">There seems to be a logical flow between a request for counsel during interrogation and the secession of interrogation, and a per se rule that the police cannot re-initiate interrogation until counsel has been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.264" offset="1103829">I see no logical connection between the request for counsel such as we had in these cases where the Judge advises a defendant, you have a right to have counsel represent you at a preliminary examination, and other judicial proceedings thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.951" offset="1266624">I think it's necessary because under the Michigan Supreme Court rule, we get into all kinds of problems that they have obviously not anticipated with a non-indigent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.664" offset="1313435">Oftentimes we find it necessary to kind of bolster the position of the indigent defendant so he's on equal footing with a non-indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.146" offset="1339349">But I think in this case, the result is to do the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.489" offset="1352723">It is to actually put the non-indigent defendant in a lower position, because what the Michigan Supreme Court doesn't even take into consideration--</text>

            <text syncTime="375.509" offset="1644772">Yes, I think so, and I think there's some important reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.132" offset="1663267">First of all, as a practical matter, at least in our courts, the police are rarely present for arraignment, for this type of an arraignment, for an initial appearance, I guess we should use the terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.815" offset="1710078">The prosecutor is not there for initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.814" offset="1721990">We have people brought through a tunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.813" offset="1730036">A court officer picks them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.141" offset="1735365">They take them down and the judge goes through this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.984" offset="1746754">There is typically nobody from our side, if you will, there to see what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.248" offset="1767757">The Michigan Supreme Court said, well, that's no problem because they can go check the court file and see what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.057" offset="1791058">Well, I submit that there are a million and one problems with the Michigan Supreme Court's thinking on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.523" offset="1812896">First of all, what the defendant does there, and this would really preclude your first example, is the district court judge cannot appoint an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.880" offset="1846333">He has no authority to, this judge that he is standing before.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.707" offset="1857618">All he can do is say, here, Mr. Defendant, here's a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.705" offset="1877576">Fill it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.252" offset="1879770">It's a financial form, says how much money he makes, how much he spends out, to see if he's indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.656" offset="1897429">All he can do is swear to the truth of that form, and then he sends that form to the circuit court administrator's office, and that's where it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.763" offset="1929820">If these diligent police officers run over and pull open the court file, there's going to be nothing in there that tells them that the man has requested counsel in this setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.247" offset="7243754">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.307" offset="7264025">Before beginning my argument I would like to first note that I do not intend to argue the first issue in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.118" offset="7291296">We are not waiving that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.649" offset="7297357">That is the issue dealing with the independent state grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.289" offset="7307910">The important question before this Court deals with the question of waiver of the constitutional right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.785" offset="7345945">That is the right that gives meaning to all other rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.535" offset="7352945">In our brief we have set out three alternatives for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.158" offset="7379381">One was that the request for counsel at arraignment was at least an ambiguous request for counsel under the Fifth Amendment; second, the Edwards analogy that the Michigan Supreme Court adopted; and third, a general waiver rule analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.415" offset="7440403">What I'd like to do this morning is approach this case from the point of view of general waiver, the general waiver rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.568" offset="7477079">I think in doing so it will become very clear why the Michigan Supreme Court ruling offers a great deal of appeal and is an appropriate rule for this Court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.702" offset="7553566">In 1938, in Johnson versus Zerbst, this Court announced a general rule of waiver for the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.838" offset="7586167">There are two aspects of that rule which I think I would like to just mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.211" offset="7611662">First, it's required that the waiver be voluntary, knowing and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.507" offset="7632769">Intelligent means that there must be an understanding of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.365" offset="7644263">Second, and this may be the key in this particular case, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.596" offset="7677177">What the State is arguing today is that the burden should be on the defendant to say that he didn't mean... he didn't really mean when he requested counsel at the arraignment that he wanted it for arraignment, he just wanted it for court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.840" offset="7738095">State has put the burden on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.776" offset="7745932">The Court, in 1938 and in many cases subsequent to 1938, the Johnson versus Zerbst opinion, has said, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.787" offset="7789922">There are two critical facts and two well-founded presumptions which, I think, are applicable in this case and perhaps virtually every other case like the cases of Mr. Jackson and Mr. Bladel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.236" offset="7843734">The first key fact is that we're dealing with... the adversary proceedings have begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.887" offset="7874349">I take issue with the State this morning that says that arraignment is merely a ministerial function and it has no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.042" offset="7902980">It is the time when the State has formally said, we are going to charge and we are going to prosecute and try to convict this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.474" offset="7948642">There is no reason except for the gathering of evidence against the accused why the police are talking to... want to talk to the individual after adversary proceedings have begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.061" offset="8014993">The second important fact is that in this case, Mr. Jackson has made an unequivocal and affirmative request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.807" offset="8053967">He did so at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.587" offset="8061177">I believe that under those circumstances the likelihood of an understanding waiver while solely in police custody is so remote that the Edwards rule, which in essence is a prophylactic rule barring the police from interrogating an individual except under unusual circumstances--</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.102" offset="8231182">Well, I think that it may not necessarily be in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.598" offset="8261171">The Court has said that in deciding whether there is waiver of either the Fifth or Sixth Amendment right to counsel, that the same test applies, that is, the Johnson versus Zerbst standard, and that looks to the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.108" offset="8323238">Perhaps I went to far in assuming... or I assumed too much in your question, but my assumption was that the Fifth Amendment right to counsel is one that is ordinarily assumed to apply prior to arraignment, prior to the time the State has formally charged the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.507" offset="8400769">At that time, it may be that the police are trying to find... decide whether the individual is a suspect to be accused, or whether he is to be let go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.550" offset="8440998">There are some circumstances under which it may be appropriate for the individual to want to talk to the police, not so after arraignment has begun.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.454" offset="8480599">Well, but of course if an individual clearly wants to talk to the police, no matter how high the standard of waiver, that standard could be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.871" offset="8514245">We're talking about, I suppose, slightly more ambiguous circumstances, and then you say that... where it's the Miranda right to counsel involved, you need less in the way of waiver than where it's the Sixth Amendment right to counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.943" offset="8574536">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.912" offset="8578402">I would like to state, as I said earlier, that there are two presumptions that are important to consider and which... in viewing these presumptions will make it clear that the Edwards rule is one that is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.074" offset="8671084">The first presumption is that a layman is unlikely to understand the value of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.604" offset="8693236">I think that is abundantly clear from reading many of the decisions of this Court, particularly starting with Powell versus Alabama in 1932 where the Court said, even the intelligent and educated layman requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step of the proceedings against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.472" offset="8756661">The second presumption is that a layman is unlikely to understand the dangers of talking with police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.172" offset="8787486">There has been a decision to prosecute in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.655" offset="8801383">These individuals have been formally charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.701" offset="8813608">They are no longer suspects; they are defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.308" offset="8824057">The police are no longer seeking to exculpate; they are seeking to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.682" offset="8841507">These presumptions are so strong that there are virtually no reasons for waiver and a prophylactic rule is very appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.865" offset="8882258">The cases that have found that there has been waiver under the circumstances of this case, like the State today, have made an upside-down application of the rule of Johnson versus Zerbst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.750" offset="8941817">That is, they have said, in essence, that the burden is on the individual to show that he wants counsel, whereas courts must indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.713" offset="8993644">If you look at what happened in the case of Robert Jackson, I think that these cases take on life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.881" offset="9030320">The police are not in a position to advise the defendant of the value of counsel or of the dangers of talking with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.097" offset="9067205">In this particular case, Robert Jackson's case, the police told Mr. White, a co-defendant, what the value of a lawyer was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.514" offset="9108792">They said, if you want a lawyer he'll tell you, don't talk to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.513" offset="9124883">But the lawyer doesn't go to jail, does he?</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.872" offset="9138258">The lawyer gets paid by how many days in trial, and if you talk with us there will be a guilty plea and no trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.805" offset="9166052">When it came it advising regarding the dangers of talking with police, the police said, we control the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.552" offset="9205027">We tell the prosecutor what's going to be charged, whether it's going to be murder one, murder two or manslaughter, or something less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.908" offset="9230418">We are the ones that advise the probation department whether you have cooperated with the police, and the judge looks to the pre-sentence report and the probation officer to decide what sentence will be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.185" offset="9279528">In conclusion, in the landmark decision of Powell versus Alabama, Justice Sutherland stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.071" offset="9327071">"Even the intelligent and educated layman requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Bretz</label>
            <text syncTime="2513.624" offset="10197262">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.700" offset="10205621">I join in counsel for Respondent Jackson's arguments concerning the higher standard of waiver for the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.322" offset="10240103">I would like to spend my limited time before the Court discussing the specific holding of the Michigan Supreme Court and the application of the Edwards rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.945" offset="10274585">The court's holding, and our position in this case is that the interrogation of the respondents following their unequivocal request for counsel at arraignment violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.079" offset="10339055">The court's holding was based on one elementary premise, and that is that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a broad, fundamental right to counsel that is provided for specifically in the Constitution, and as a result it differs significantly from the Miranda right to counsel which is referred to as the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.900" offset="10418363">The Sixth Amendment provides the right to counsel at all stages of the proceedings including, in this case, the post-arraignment interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.662" offset="10453471">I think under this Court's decision in Brewer it is very clear that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applied during that interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.752" offset="10481788">The Fifth Amendment right was designed only to protect the defendant's rights to remain silent and as has been stated before this Court, it routinely applies in the pre-arraignment custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.059" offset="10551065">The premise of the Sixth Amendment right is a broader and more fundamental right than the judicially created Fifth Amendment right, I believe is self evident, and is amply supported by this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.975" offset="10594637">It follows, I believe, from that premise that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel must be at least as scrupulously honored as the Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.830" offset="10638105">In the cases before this Court, specifically in my client's case, Mr. Bladel requested counsel from a judge at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.749" offset="10669765">Following that request he told the police officers during the Miranda warning at the point where they advised him,</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.450" offset="10700589">"You have a right to an attorney. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.589" offset="10705187">he advised them,</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.494" offset="10884805">and according to the police he said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.571" offset="10893060">"I don't know where he is. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.634" offset="10897344">I think, yes, in answer to your question, that should have stopped it right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.116" offset="10915212">The police had been made aware of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.412" offset="10936423">The defendant had alerted them of his request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.926" offset="10946454">That should have stopped the proceedings, that is, the interrogation until counsel was made present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.237" offset="10967770">I think it's also important in this case that my client had sat in this jail for three full days without speaking to any lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.999" offset="10994728">The only people he spoke to were the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.170" offset="11007476">At a minimum, I would ask this Court to apply the rigid bright line rule of Edwards versus Arizona to this case and to any case where the defendant has invoked his right to counsel whether that request is directed to a judge or to a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.476" offset="11076648">That is the distinction that petitioner has raised before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.738" offset="11093785">The way I hear his argument is that, somehow my client's request for counsel was less effective because he directed it only to a judge and not to the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.095" offset="11135163">In his brief, petitioner argues that respondent only exercised a portion of his Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present in the courtroom and not the interrogation room.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.006" offset="11238816">Well, I suppose you could argue that any police officer who knows that an arraignment has taken place should assume that he's asked for counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.673" offset="11281448">--Exactly, and in this case the facts are... that is the Bladel case... the facts are that the interrogating officers' superior, that is, the chief investigator on the case, was in fact present at arraignment, so there's no great burden of having to read ambiguous court files, they just call the boss and he could have told him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.416" offset="11344456">But, that's okay because my client told them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.868" offset="11354278">The petitioner's distinction between where this request is directed, I believe is artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.928" offset="11378519">The Sixth Amendment as I have said applies to all stages including this interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.864" offset="11398268">While there are differences in the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights that the Prosecutor hinges his entire argument upon, I think it is highly improbable that these distinctions are understood by a typical criminal defendant, and this goes to the question Justice O'Connor directed to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.671" offset="11461484">I believe a typical criminal defendant, once he has told a judge, "I want counsel", has done all that he can do to have his right honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.040" offset="11506937">The right to counsel, to this defendant or to any defendant, is in fact the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.788" offset="11537971">Hair-splitting does not enter into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.460" offset="11548629">He should be entitled to presume that he has done all that he can do to secure this valuable right without having to worry about whether he has directed his request to the right authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.799" offset="11593977">This Court should adopt the rule that any request bars further interrogation, and there is yet another reason for adopting this rule, other than the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.122" offset="11635251">It is a bright line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.966" offset="11642669">I think that's extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.683" offset="11653536">That's what makes Edwards and Miranda, because I believe they must be read together, that's what makes them such effective decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.821" offset="11682062">Such a bright line rule as we are proposing in this case would in fact ease the administration of justice, would make the job of the courts much easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.489" offset="11724694">Counsel is requested; that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.535" offset="11732949">No interrogation, unless defendant initiates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.940" offset="11742562">It would make the job of the police, I believe, much easier, and I believe as this Court has stated before, that the police operating in the field need bright line rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.278" offset="11787910">I also don't think it is wise, after the Sixth Amendment has attached, to make the police the legal advisor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.963" offset="11818630">Perhaps that is necessary in Miranda because in Miranda the defendant... prior to the Miranda decision the suspect did not have a right to counsel in an interrogation room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.005" offset="11858754">This Court in Miranda felt that was necessary, and I believe the waiver designed in Miranda is adequate for that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.051" offset="11890937">I believe that the purpose of Edwards as defined by this Court in Illinois versus Smith is furthered by the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.578" offset="11925105">The purpose of Edwards was to prevent the badgering or the wearing down of the suspect into giving up a right once he has invoked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.996" offset="11962722">If you look at the facts of this case, that is my case, the Bladel case, he sat there for three days after asking for an attorney, not knowing what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.103" offset="11999189">He testified at his suppression hearing that,</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.616" offset="12013295">"I really didn't know if I was qualified, if they were going to give me an attorney. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.865" offset="12026252">The finder of fact at the suppression hearing did not discredit that testimony and in fact that testimony was adopted in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.955" offset="12058643">I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.049" offset="12063032">There is the possibility here that the failure to provide counsel timely, the re-interrogation by the police in the absence of counsel, had the effect of wearing down Mr. Bladel into giving up the right he had already invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.200" offset="12123636">But again, I would remind the Court that under the Illinois versus Smith decision, actual coercion is not relevant in an Edwards inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.493" offset="12152789">If this Court finds the Edwards rule applicable, whether directly or by analogy, I think that's the end of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.269" offset="12203884">The cases here have to be affirmed, the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.548" offset="12224991">Waiver is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.453" offset="12232619">If the Court does not accept the Edwards analysis, I think there is still the question of waiver that must be reached, which is why we have briefed that issue and raised it before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.543" offset="12272952">Very briefly, I think counsel for respondent Jackson gave the waiver argument to this Court, and as I said I join in it, but I would just ask this Court to look very carefully at that because this Court has never defined precisely the standards for waiver in a Sixth Amendment interrogation context as we have in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.159" offset="12355394">The Massiah, Henry... the trio of cases dealing with Sixth Amendment confessions, this Court found a violation of the right in all those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.155" offset="12407430">Thank you, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.310" offset="12412028">Massiah, Henry and Brewer, there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment right in all three of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.934" offset="12426552">Waiver did not become the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.419" offset="12432508">The only Sixth Amendment waiver cases that this Court has deal with the right to counsel at trial or at a guilty plea refer to Faretta, Johnson versus Zerbst, by Moltke versus Gillies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.758" offset="12477856">As I have argued in my brief and as the Second Circuit has adopted, a Faretta type waiver is certainly a more appropriate standard of waiver in this context, now that the Sixth Amendment has attached, more appropriate than the Miranda waiver, and I would ask the Court to look at that for purposes of a waiver decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.187" offset="12559567">In conclusion, I would ask this Court to adopt the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.042" offset="12586944">I think that it is a rational, logical decision; that it is constitutionally necessary to protect the valued Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.134" offset="12615365">I would ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
