            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="189585">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.860" offset="209752">This case concerns the validity of a system for effectuating an agency shop agreement, such agreements as the litigation to this point in this Court shows are those that provide that, where a majority of an appropriate collective bargaining unit has selected an exclusive bargaining representative, all the employees within the bargaining unit are required to pay a sum equal to a percentage of union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.906" offset="397938">The litigation in this Court to this point demonstrates that the requirement of support of all of the employees for the representative is constitutionally appropriate so long as the union uses the money of individuals who file objections only for matters relating to collective bargaining and attendant activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.185" offset="575048">And in the Ellis v. Railway Clerks case in 1984, the Court began the process, at least under the Railway Labor Act, of specifying which of the union's costs are chargeable to such objectors and which are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.015" offset="662402">In this case, the Seventh Circuit confined itself to a procedural issue, and indeed the Seventh Circuit remarked in its opinion that the plaintiffs below, the Respondents in this Court, had predicated their challenge on procedural due process issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.582" offset="772638">The Seventh Circuit ruled that a system such as the one here, whereby the union calculates and, as the district court's uncontested findings state, carefully documents the portion of union dues that represents the... and here I quote the state statutory language...</text>
            <text syncTime="182.964" offset="874203">"the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration. "</text>
            <text syncTime="188.934" offset="898026">and provides an advance reduction from regular union dues based on that calculation, and that furthermore places the payments of objectors who pay in this reduced amount into an interest-bearing escrow account pending the objector's use of either an internal review proceeding within the union which ends before an arbitrator selected from a list maintained by the state by the union, or through judicial review, does not accord the objector due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.890" offset="1129889">In other words, the court held that, even though the union makes the calculation and provides an advanced reduction and backs up that advanced reduction by an interest-bearing escrow account into which is placed the money of objectors while they pursue their challenges to the union's calculation, the objector is not given due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.046" offset="1274503">Would you say the Court of Appeals said that, even though the substantive result reached was right, there still was a procedural component that was separate from that?</text>

            <text syncTime="293.835" offset="1317657">The Seventh Circuit said that it needn't get into the substantive issue, that it could assume that the calculation was correct and that not a penny of the objector's money would be spent for an impermissible purpose, and nonetheless there would be a constitutional violation in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.208" offset="1763097">But the Seventh Circuit's position as it articulated it is that a procedure with the safeguards I've just outlined nonetheless works a deprivation of the objector's liberty interest, which that court noted are taken to or determined by the objector's right of non-association.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.331" offset="1907607">And it is our position that that ruling of the Seventh Circuit is erroneous, that it is contrary to the method of approach this Court stated in Abood versus the Detroit Federation of Teachers in 431 U.S., which is the other public sector agency shop case in this Court, and flatly contrary to what the Court had to say in Ellis versus Railway Clerks, a 1984 decision, albeit one arising under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.133" offset="2118885">In determining what due process is required in this case, and as I think the Court of Appeals recognized, the beginning point has to be the nature of the objector's liberty interest, the nature of his right of non-association.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.216" offset="2227136">And this Court has spoken to the nature of that interest and that right in the Abood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.656" offset="2264962">And in Abood... and this was foreshadowed in earlier cases as well... the Court defined the objector's interest and his right as not being required to provide compulsory subsidization of union ideological and political activity not related to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.158" offset="2378960">And the Court has at every point phrased its holdings as being that the First Amendment does limit the uses to which the union can put funds obtained from dissenting employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.589" offset="2460671">That was the phrase used in the most recent case, in the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.691" offset="2477076">And the Court throughout has made it plain that the union shop and the agency shop concepts themselves are constitutional and that, as the Court put it in one of the earliest cases, that the mere collection of an amount equal to or a proportion of union dues does not work any unconstitutional deprivation of the objector's rights, that because of the weighty interests of the Government in industrial peace and the governmental determination that equal support of all employees in the bargaining unit of the exclusive representative, insofar as the exclusive representative is engaging in activities that are related to or germane to its functions as an exclusive representative--</text>

            <text syncTime="657.941" offset="2774036">I suppose the Court has recognized a First Amendment interest in non-members for use of their money for political purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.995" offset="2906320">Now, would it be a less burdensome method here to have an independent determination ahead of time of the amount that should be withheld, as opposed to the method used here, which is placing it in escrow and then giving the non-member a right to challenge it later?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.826" offset="2989598">Would it be in your view possibly less burdensome if there were some mechanism for an independent determination ahead of time?</text>

            <text syncTime="733.239" offset="3075280">--I don't believe that it is fair to say that it would be less burdensome on the First Amendment right than the escrow system, because the First Amendment right is the right not to subsidize a First Amendment activity with which one disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.855" offset="3165768">There is another aspect to this case, albeit one not treated below, which the Respondents' brief is devoted to, namely a claim that there's a burden on the individual's property right, the right to uncontrolled dominion of the $16 and I think it's 84 cents per month that is in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.672" offset="3281020">But I don't think that the requirement that the individual paid the money into escrow can properly be said to be a burden on that individual's First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.932" offset="3330026">The burden comes if the individual's money is appropriated to the union's activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.363" offset="7587776">I came here and I remain somewhat perplexed in attempting to determine for myself what the utility is of viewing this case as a First Amendment case that involves the uses of fees that a union is collecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.973" offset="7654232">We're not dealing at this stage with uses, except in an abstract definitional sense that they are entitled to money only that will be eventually used for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.264" offset="7695401">And no money here has been used because, as Justice White suggested a moment ago, during the course of litigation the union introduced an escrow procedure where it segregated the moneys in a separate account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.827" offset="7913576">What does the Seventh Circuit tell us?</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.461" offset="7920158">It says, well, there's a liberty interest involved in the taking of this money because the money will be used by a union and therefore it arguably infringes freedom of association to take it, but that liberty interest is not unconstitutionally infringed, per Abood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.003" offset="7970314">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.853" offset="7973762">You can deprive a person of liberty and of property and even of his life, if you give him due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.548" offset="8044501">And I think the very simple answer... and that's why I'm perplexed... the very simple answer is there is no constitutional procedure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.369" offset="8071773">There's no procedure that meets any standard, it seems to me, that this Court has ever suggested is applicable, except in some extraordinary emergency situations, which we do not have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.033" offset="8262467">And I think before that step is taken, some decisionmaker has to have some type of factual presentation at least at the level of probable cause, at least at the level of rationality, to suggest that this figure that's being given has some connection with the reality of the collective bargaining activities of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.977" offset="8338222">Now, in the first year, I agree with Mr. Gold, it's a more difficult problem because we don't know precisely what the union is doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.269" offset="8483358">That is, we obviously want to prevent the union from getting control of the money to expend that money until we determine that that money will be spent only on First Amendment allowed activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.206" offset="8603104">That is, if this money were being taken to pay some other debt that these people owed the union, not a payment that implicated associational interests, we'd still be worried about the collection procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.679" offset="8653050">We're going to be worried about this collection procedure in any kind of a creditor-debtor framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.231" offset="8671231">There's a secondary problem that not only are we worried about the initial taking, but we're also worried about the transfer to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.337" offset="8699652">Now, what I'm saying in this case is the union has precluded any difficulty with the use question through an escrow, and I think a procedure... and now we're talking about a procedure that the state will have to devise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.164" offset="8759003">I don't think it's for this Court to tell us what that procedure should be in every permutation and combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.317" offset="8783558">It's for the state also to devise a procedure whereby the union does not obtain possession, is not allowed to use that money, until there's a final determination that precludes First Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.542" offset="8832459">But what I'm getting at here is, at this stage of the case we have a procedural due process problem pure and simple because the taking is effective without any submission to any governmental agency of a rational basis that the figure the union gives has some connection with its real collective bargaining costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.206" offset="8911140">What they do is they take the union dues, an arbitrary figure, no necessary connection with the collective bargaining there, they subtract what they admit they're not entitled to have, and they say: Aha, the answer is collective bargaining costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.125" offset="12506843">I think when the union comes to the state agency, the board, let's say, and what it has as the evidence for its fee request is some sort of determination made by an independent accounting firm or arbitrator or whatever you want to call this, now, that's some probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.186" offset="12583016">Whether it rises to the level of what I would call probable cause is another question, and you have to look at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.090" offset="12602660">But that isn't what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.090" offset="12610705">The independent determination, the basis for this claim, was not made before the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.394" offset="12631917">It was made after the taking, or to be made after the taking, because actually no one went through that internal union procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.916" offset="12665980">I'm not saying that the union can't generate these figures initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.452" offset="12680087">I'm saying that it should generate the figures initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.154" offset="12690954">It should be required to take it to some responsible official in the state and justify this with some minimal level of factual and legal basis, and then that agency can say, all right, now we're going to collect this money, and maybe then it can be put into escrow, so we don't have the problem Justice O'Connor discussed of impermissible uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.185" offset="12783009">But first let's have some rational basis for this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.721" offset="12797220">We have no procedure now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.923" offset="12805997">We have a union coming to a Government official and saying, we want those people's property and we're really not going to tell you why, because as they say and admit at every level in this litigation, they calculate the fee by subtracting an arbitrary number from an arbitrary number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.683" offset="12861063">And if that doesn't come up with an arbitrary number, I'm not too good at arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.384" offset="12871825">They simply have not documented the actual services they've performed or the costs of those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.769" offset="12893350">Now, I don't think that's a great deal of documentation, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.804" offset="12905471">If they've done these things, they have a record of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.422" offset="12919995">If they plan to do them, they have a proposed budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.958" offset="12930131">And I don't see why they can't do the same thing that's been required in Sniadach, Fuentes, North Georgia Finishing, Mitchell versus W.T. Grant... some kind of factual evidence presented to a neutral government official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.032" offset="12986451">I don't think it has to be a judicial, full-blown judicial evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.002" offset="13002333">It probably doesn't even have to be a full-blown administrative evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.954" offset="13022082">But it has to be something more than nothing.</text>
