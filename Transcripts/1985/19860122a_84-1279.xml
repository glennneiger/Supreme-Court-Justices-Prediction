            <text syncTime="1205.200" offset="4966358">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court in this case is essentially one of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.917" offset="5001258">As the Court's questions have made clear, the question here turns on prejudice, and whether prejudice is an element of the claim that a defendant must make in order to establish a confrontation clause violation or whether it is part of the harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.254" offset="5058623">Now, in our brief we haven't focused on that precise question, because the question presented in the petition didn't seem to do that and because the allocation of the burden of proof in this case should not be outcome determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.873" offset="5109091">In Hastings the Court made clear that most constitutional errors can be harmless, but Hastings like Chapman, said that there are certain categories of errors that are not susceptible to that type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.478" offset="5159455">The first and most elementary category are those errors that for one reason or another effectively deprive the defendant of what has come to be known as a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.115" offset="5194041">That follows directly from the due process principle that a defendant cannot be punished at all by the state or by the government until he has received a trial that accords with basic fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.204" offset="5234375">In a case where the defendant may have denied all opportunity to cross examine any of the government's witnesses, which was essentially what you had in Brookhart versus Janus, you may have a situation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.325" offset="5282858">In that type of circumstance, the defendant has essentially been relegated to the position of being a member of the audience rather than an actual participant at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.494" offset="5315563">But this case doesn't even closely approximate that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.709" offset="5332386">However harmful the error may have been in the defense view, however essential it may have been to bring this evidence before the trier of fact, what you essentially have here is one item of evidence that was not allowed to be introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.637" offset="12236131">I think what the State of Delaware is trying to argue here is that you can quantify all these things, but at some point quality is important, and if you have one question, one good question on cross examination, why did you go across the hall to Robert Fleetwood's apartment, to kill Robert Fleetwood, that that may be all it takes for the prosecution to completely undermine the defense that was presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.752" offset="12336546">We think that is certainly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.549" offset="12347726">Robert Van Arsdall was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.376" offset="12355041">His co-defendant, where virtually the same evidence was offered at his trial, the same forensic expert, Dr. Lee, testified against Daniel Pregent at Pregent's trial, and Pregent was acquitted at a subsequent hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.057" offset="12409793">We think that there is certainly a problem here that the Delaware Supreme Court has attempted to deal with this difficulty in its trial courts by drawing a broad line that any trial judge will be cognizant of in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.426" offset="12467263">That is, they have to allow some bias cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.691" offset="12484295">As long as they do that, and then they can properly exercise their sound judicial discretion, then the Delaware Supreme Court will analyze for harmlesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.842" offset="12524941">However, if they do not do that, have a total in limine prohibition, and it does not meet any of the other recognized exceptions to the Delaware rule, then Delaware will certainly apply a per se error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.292" offset="12570708">The Delaware rule, as I said, does give meaningful guidance to a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.944" offset="12601323">The difficulty here is that the trial judge really is not going to know during the course of the trial if a witness is then crucial or then important or may subsequently, as the facts in this particular case indicate, become important later on because of subsequent developments in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.953" offset="12673421">A determination of witness credibility has to be left to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.166" offset="12714277">An appellate court cannot speculate what a jury would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.337" offset="12730890">A jury is the sole judge of witness credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.633" offset="12744056">There is no significant competing state interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.679" offset="12756281">At least in the Davis situation it was an Alaska state policy of confidentiality of juvenile delinquency adjudications, but there is no such state policy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.127" offset="12806123">It has been argued that you will preserve scarce trial resources if you don't have a per se rule but a harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.015" offset="12841650">It is the position of Mr. Van Arsdall that you preserve scarce trial resources by making it plain that this type of error will not be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.572" offset="12879893">Fleetwood's credibility was an important issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.898" offset="12901209">Fleetwood's testimony hurt the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.412" offset="12915210">Without Fleetwood, there was no prosecution explanation for why Van Arsdall went across the hall, apart from Van Arsdall's innocent explanation for his post-homicide conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.970" offset="12969441">This is not the erroneous admission of harmless testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.374" offset="12987099">This is the exclusion of defense evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.154" offset="13002146">The evidence offered by Fleetwood undercut the defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.808" offset="13020745">What Fleetwood testified to may have been cumulative in content, but it certainly was not cumulative in probative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.554" offset="13055749">The offer of proof made in this case clearly establishes what evidence of bias or interest the defense intended to present to the jury had it been permitted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.706" offset="13104441">The factual distinction between the erroneous admission of harmless testimony and the wrongful exclusion of defense evidence makes a logical excision in this case impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.184" offset="13170270">That is, you can't just take it out, and the reason you can't take it out and speculate what the jury would have done was because the jury never heard it, and that is the distinction between this case and the Harrington line of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.302" offset="13222724">This was a circumstantial evidence case, unlike Harrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.364" offset="13239024">There was not overwhelming untainted evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.362" offset="13251041">In fact, by the time of closing argument, the prosecution was still not sure who had committed this homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.187" offset="13282283">It offered the jury two alternative theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.749" offset="13292523">That is, that Van Arsdall alone may have committed the murder or that somehow Van Arsdall may have been an accomplice to Daniel Pregent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.902" offset="13329199">As I pointed out, by the subsequent trial, Daniel Pregent was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.541" offset="13347694">We agree that a confessing defendant, as in Schaebel versus Florida, has little reason to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.036" offset="13381757">And that is simply because the Sixth Amendment really isn't implicated in that type of situation, but here Fleetwood's testimony was used to the detriment of Van Arsdall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.111" offset="13430032">Among the essentials of a fair trial is that each side has an opportunity to present its evidence to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.465" offset="13479455">When a conviction is based only on the prosecution's evidence, justice has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.493" offset="13507563">If there are no additional questions, we submit the case to the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Fairbanks, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3350.083" offset="13545911">Thank you, Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.958" offset="13549359">I would like to make three quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.534" offset="13567749">One, in response to Justice Rehnquist's question about how much transcript is involved for Robert Fleetwood's testimony, the entire direct, cross, and voir dire in which legal arguments were made and the inquiry was made of Fleetwood took 51 pages of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.653" offset="13628144">It begins on Page 73 of the joint appendix, and it reflects that it went from 40 to 91 of the trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.586" offset="13671926">Fleetwood... the defense theory of Fleetwood's importance has three problems with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.740" offset="13700556">One, the inferences that the defense seeks to draw are fairly attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.614" offset="13716020">Fleetwood said he simply poked his head in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.191" offset="13726365">He didn't talk to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.674" offset="13736291">There is no indication that he was seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.798" offset="13744755">The prosecutor in closing didn't argue the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.421" offset="13767220">That wasn't the basis of the state's theory as to why Van Arsdall went across the hall, and three of the defendants didn't even notice that this was a problem until after he had read the transcript at least twice, because he only raises this theory for the first time in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.570" offset="13835870">The second point is, the Delaware rule is clearly a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.396" offset="13855201">In its holding at Page A7 of the petition the court said in establishing a per se error rule, it said consequently the actual prejudicial impact of such an error is not examined, and reversal is not mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.625" offset="13912043">The third point simply is that this Court has recently recognized that confrontation clause cases fall into two broad categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.168" offset="13942241">The first category is the hearsay, the out of court declarations in which there is no cross examination of anybody, of any witness.</text>
