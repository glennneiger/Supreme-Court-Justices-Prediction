            <text syncTime="20.673" offset="225686">I represent the petitioner, Millie R. Lee, who was convicted in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois, of the murders of Odessa Harris and Mattie Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.081" offset="267273">The issue presented before this Court today is one involving significant rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States involving the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.341" offset="320354">The specific issue involved in this case is whether those amendments were violated when the trial judge in this case sitting as the trier of fact stated on the record that he was considering the co-defendant's confession against my client, Millie R. Lee, in finding her guilty of the two murders of Odessa Harris and Mattie Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.466" offset="420873">The issue arises specifically because in this case in a bench trial the judge noted that he was considering this as substantive evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.616" offset="793484">At the beginning of trial when they said that their motion to sever would be moot or disregarded, it is because they went in on the understanding that the judge would be able to consider the evidence separately against each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.138" offset="863492">The general rule of law, of course, is that the judge can compartmentalize his mind and separate the evidence and consider the evidence separately.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dan W. Evers</label>
            <text syncTime="231.795" offset="1070173">When he finds my client, Millie Lee, guilty at the end of the presentation of the evidence and at the end of arguments by counsel, the trial court judge states in his finding of guilt that the petitioner is guilty as charged, and he states, I reject... basically he says, I reject her defense because her argument is that she was not guilty of the murder of Odessa Harris because she had no intent to kill, did not plan to kill, and did not know that Edwin Thomas was going to kill Odessa Harris, and that her second defense was that the killing of Mattie Darden would be voluntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.337" offset="1260344">The trial court judge says, I reject that because whether there is a plan to kill is disputed by the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.582" offset="1301304">The co-defendant's confession clearly shows that there was premeditation, and then he also says that he rejects voluntary manslaughter because the co-defendant's confession says that Edwin Thomas had asked her to go in and take care of Mattie Darden.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.399" offset="1400570">The general basic facts of the confession by the co-defendant Edwin Thomas and the statement by Millie Lee is, there is a great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.620" offset="1461487">I would argue that there is no confession to murder in Millie Lee's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.662" offset="1481654">Her statement only involves that she was in her apartment with her boyfriend, Edwin Thomas, her aunt Mattie Darden, and another woman by the name of Odessa Harris, and there had been some conflicts earlier, but in an argument with Odessa Harris, Odessa Harris was leaving, and Edwin Thomas snuck up behind her and stabbed her in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.500" offset="1584994">Edwin Thomas's statement, his confession says that Millie Lee and Odessa Harris were standing in the kitchen talking, and he went up to sneak up behind her in the kitchen and stab her in the back, but Odessa Harris caught him, and he had to wrestle her to the floor, and stabbed her in the chest or stomach area.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.902" offset="1670571">There is a great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.764" offset="1682065">The problem is in this case Edwin Thomas's confession says that they had talked for months about the problem with Mattie Darden, and that they had talked about the need to kill Mattie Darden, and that that night they talked about it and talked about the need to kill Odessa Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.817" offset="1762209">There is no such admissions, there are no such statements in Millie Lee's statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.873" offset="5102434">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent's position, simply stated, is that there was no constitutional error in this case in the admission and use of the co-defendant's confession against the defendant, and secondly, that if there was any error, it was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.737" offset="5177980">The tension that has long existed between the use of hearsay in a criminal case and the rights of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment can be lessened by the opinion of the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.176" offset="5227717">The Sixth Amendment, of course, does not bar all hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.648" offset="5241615">Competing rights and public policy interest may outweigh the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him at a trial without any cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.076" offset="5287277">Ohio v. Roberts establishes a two-pronged test for determining what hearsay is admissible without cross examination and without violation of the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.455" offset="5336805">By applying the logic and the sensible principles and the very workable guidelines of Roberts to the facts of this case, respondents believe that their position is supported and that the Court can find that the petitioner's rights under the Sixth Amendment were not violated or infringed by the use of her co-defendant's confession against her at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.708" offset="5425830">For this reason, we urge that no error be found, and that the petitioner's conviction be left intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.091" offset="5455296">The evidence in the record before this Court is overwhelming of her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, even absent consideration of the co-defendant's remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.489" offset="5496988">For this reason, too, the opinion of the Illinois appellate court should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.192" offset="6131763">We believe that rather than having a conviction saved by the harmless error argument after the fact, that it would be better for this Court to rule that it was admissible, and to give guidance so that prosecutors and trial courts know what evidence may be used in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.563" offset="6201249">Roberts really makes the touchstone for admissibility reliability, and under the two-pronged test of Roberts this was clearly the kind of reliable hearsay that the courts have long regarded as admissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.068" offset="9091228">So, the murder occurred after the self-defense, if ever there was one, and I think that her confession even earlier makes clear there is none, but certainly there is no doubt about it at that point, and Illinois case law on this is very clear that she would not have a self-defense left at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.493" offset="9792981">One of the problems that has occurred in reading the cases is that there is a question about whether a confession is different than other statements against penal interest, and there has been perhaps some argument that there is a presumption against the reliability of such confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.355" offset="9864452">While even if a rebuttable presumption is warranted, we think that the creation as is suggested by this case of an irrebuttable presumption, that that is not required by the Sixth Amendment, nor is it consistent with this Court's rulings or with good public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.058" offset="9939267">Indeed, a reverse presumption of trustworthiness may even be warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.060" offset="9959224">As this Court said in California versus Green and in Matlock, a confession to murder has its own indicia of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.185" offset="9987750">As Oliver Wendell Holmes said in his dissent in Donnelly, no other statement is so much against interest as a confession to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.691" offset="10021709">It is far more calculated to convince than the dying declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.712" offset="10037801">Because of the reliability of a murder confession, especially when coupled with the corroborative elements such as exist in this case, respondents urge this Court to find under Roberts that petitioner's co-defendant's confession had sufficient indicia of reliability to be properly admitted without trial cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.076" offset="10115332">Such a holding would be consistent with Roberts and Pointer, California versus Green, Barber and Moates, which all permitted the inculpatory use against a defendant of preliminary hearing testimony where there was cross examination of the declarant, or perhaps even where there was only an opportunity for cross examination is suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.148" offset="10191610">It is also consistent with Dutton, wherein the Court ruled that a Georgia rule of evidence which permitted a concealment phase conspiracy statement to be admitted without violating the Sixth Amendment, and with Mancusi versus Stubbs-Maddox, which held the admission of a transcript from the first trial to be admissible without violation of the Sixth at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.923" offset="10278650">The ruling that we urge the Court here to find is also consistent with the purpose of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.947" offset="10306757">According to Parker, the Sixth Amendment is intended to be a safeguard to ensure the fairness and accuracy of criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.381" offset="10336537">According to Dutton, the mission of the confrontation clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth determining process in criminal trials by assuring the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.412" offset="10400589">Following the decisions and logic of this Court's rulings in Roberts and other cases, we believe that there is a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the underlying statement, and at least two Federal Courts of Appeals have ruled that the admission of an inculpatory statement against penal interest is admissible against a defendant, and two courts have ruled that a co-conspirator confession statement inculpating the defendant is also admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.051" offset="10515215">These decisions and the logic and policy underlying them support the result respondents urge before this Court today, which is that the co-defendant's interlocking confession be included with other inculpatory statements against penal interest in the category of reliable and therefore admissible hearsay despite the absence of cross examination at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.997" offset="10602986">Where the courts have found that the substantive use of hearsay is permissible against a defendant, the courts have said that although there is a preference for a face to face confrontation as a means of testing the truth of the underlying statement, that right of cross examination may be replaced by other guarantees of trustworthiness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.681" offset="11069742">The Roberts test, of course, requires unavailability, which we have already discussed and demonstrated why the declarant was unavailable, but there is also a substitute for that, which is that the cross examination would be of so little value that it is unnecessary, and again clearly here there would have been no benefit to the defendant in cross examining when she would have still been faced with the admission of the full crime in her own confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.134" offset="11639525">And Odessa Harris's murder, as I said earlier, is fully admitted, because all it requires to prove her guilt of that is that she intended to assist or facilitate before or during her co-defendant's acts, and on her own confession, as I have pointed out, that is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.458" offset="11720818">She did admit stopping her aunt from helping here, which under People v. Gill and People v. Richardson is enough to make her accountable for the murder of Odessa.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.627" offset="12805526">In that case, one co-defendant said, I shot... the other co-defendant shot the victim, and the other co-defendant blamed the other one, and the judge said, I won't consider that part, but I will consider this, and they said there was no reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.647" offset="12869579">They did not say that it was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.051" offset="12887237">They did not say that it was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.561" offset="12893193">They just said that under Parker versus Randolph and some other Illinois cases, that it was not error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.769" offset="12934049">How they came to that conclusion, I am not really sure, but that is what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.042" offset="12955156">The state's position today is at variance with what their position was in the response to the cert petition filed by Millie Lee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.625" offset="13037494">In the cert petition the State of Illinois said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.127" offset="13055466">"A co-defendant's confession may be used only against the declarant, and the trial court should not in any way have considered the co-defendant's confession against the petitioner. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.065" offset="13103218">Now, that is what they conceded in the petition for certiorari response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.600" offset="13129340">How they come into this Court today and say that Illinois law would make this admissible I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.705" offset="13165807">Their brief when they talk about Illinois law indicates that the Illinois Supreme Court may have some rule in the future, but they do not cite anywhere in their brief any case which would make this admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.026" offset="13231113">And as far as what the appellate court of Illinois decided in this case, they implicitly decided that it was admissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.634" offset="13281477">I would like to sure up and say that Your Honor should hold this as a violation because there is no reliability demonstrated by the State of Illinois in this case as to the parts that the judge used in finding Millie Lee guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.717" offset="13357859">The parts that the judge used are not parts corroborated by any other evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.960" offset="13430793">These statements used by the trial court judge standing alone are no more reliable than if he had just merely said we plan to kill, we killed, and that is it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.916" offset="13598604">The state's position is based on their premise that Millie Lee's statement is overwhelming in implicating her guilt, yet if it was so overwhelming, why did the trial court judge feel the need to reach out and use the co-defendant's confession?</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.138" offset="13667567">If there was the sufficient evidence within the petitioner's statement, there was no need to reach out and grab hold of this prejudicial confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.248" offset="13731933">There is a difference in the intents put into the different statements, and I would suggest that there is a problem with the co-defendant's confession in that it is unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.277" offset="13788044">He gave the confession only after he knew that Millie Lee had given a statement implicating him in the killings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.443" offset="13824720">What effect that had upon him is not certain, but he would have a motive for malice, he would have a motive to lie about Millie Lee's involvement, whether to drag her down or to take her and implicate her more deeply in the killings, it is not certain, but what is certain is that his statements standing alone as to how the killings occurred and what motivated them are uncorroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.535" offset="13957108">The major point in that is that the state points to Millie Lee's statement where she witnessed the murder of Odessa Harris and then ran into her aunt's bedroom, was confronted by a knife, and she ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.099" offset="14035371">Now, they try and use that and say she had no need to come back, voluntary manslaughter would not be appropriate, but I would suggest that that is just a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.228" offset="14079884">The point is that the judge also pointed to the idea in Edwin Thomas's confession that he originally gave Millie Lee a knife and said go keep your aunt quiet, and gave her a knife and sent her into the bedroom to stab here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.248" offset="14143936">Those are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.010" offset="14151042">What happened in this trial is, the judge used that statement by Edwin Thomas to impute her helping, her aiding in the killing of Odessa Harris to Millie Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.750" offset="14209974">Millie Lee's statement only says she ran into the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.750" offset="14225961">Now, whether she did that to aid does not appear in her statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.515" offset="14249053">She may have been just running away in a slightly shocked manner in which to get away from this very hideous killing by Edwin Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.946" offset="14306731">But it cannot be said that her statement reflects that she was trying to aid Edwin Thomas by stopping Mattie Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.161" offset="14347587">That does not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.182" offset="14355737">That is just speculation brought out of the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.676" offset="14381651">I would also like to point out that the state could have brought Edwin Thomas in to testify.</text>
