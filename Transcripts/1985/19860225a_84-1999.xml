            <text syncTime="38.605" offset="298963">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner here questions whether or not the District Court below is empowered by the Congress of these United States to award quota relief and promotions to a class of persons none of whom had ever been shown to be specific victims of any past promotional discriminatory practices of the City of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.109" offset="380988">Reviewing the decisions of this Court together with the clear and absolute legislative intent of Congress, it seems to us, as we have steadfastly maintained, this court ordered remedy below was not lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.928" offset="432292">This is purely a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.819" offset="443891">There was in fact a consent decree in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.941" offset="456325">That consent decree was negotiated from the very beginning between the city of Cleveland and the Vanguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.339" offset="489971">The matter was filed in District Court in the fall of 1980, and intervention was not sought as a matter of right by the intervenors, the local which I represent here today, until the spring of 1981, and it was in fact granted together with the filing of our responsive pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.388" offset="550157">Negotiations continued between the city of Cleveland and the Vanguards to the exclusion of Local 93 until roughly November of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.286" offset="601775">In November of 1981, a proposed consent decree in draft form was presented to me as counsel for the intervenors, and a quick meeting thereafter was held in the chambers of the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.746" offset="663528">Initially it was said to have</text>
            <text syncTime="131.647" offset="671156">"approved the fairness of the proposed consent decree. "</text>
            <text syncTime="137.870" offset="696025">At that time, the United States District Court said, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.413" offset="710235">I have allowed this union in.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.574" offset="718908">I want this union to participate, and I want them to have full participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.209" offset="737403">We did in fact have full participation in the negotiation process to our knowledge from that point on.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.561" offset="762794">In the fall of 1982, due to the illness of our trial judge, the magistrate took over the negotiating process and, yes, long and arduous, as both briefs have stated, discussions, negotiating sessions were had towards the possibility of a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.917" offset="852237">I might add to you, however, that from the very beginning the position of this local union was the imposition of quota remedy relief against any of its members was in fact an unlawful exercise of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.028" offset="920678">While it was not articulated as such, they said that they felt that the quota relief in any form in preference, racial preference of any individual over another was not lawful, and that that... certainly the lawfulness of that would be derived from 706(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="211.489" offset="990581">This court order became a consent decree in the absence of the signature of this local.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.115" offset="1029034">The membership of that local, almost 90 percent of it, rejected this consent decree because of the very quota relief which was contained therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.952" offset="1068426">It was entered over their objections, and I add to you that in seeking the imprimatur of the District Court by way of an attempt to utilize the District Court, its attendant jurisdictional powers, its contempt powers, and everything else, the City of Cleveland, certainly with a keen interest in not having any back pay awards, chose to settle the alleged discriminatory wrongs in the past on the backs of the innocent non-minority firefighters.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.196" offset="1217324">We felt that was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.558" offset="1222862">We feel that is wrong as we stand before you today.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.967" offset="3528430">Going on to paraphrase, the relief available, and this is Senator Humphrey again, is a court order enjoining the offender from engaging further in discriminatory practices, and that is by necessity what must happen in the employment of quota relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.809" offset="3967809">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as Mr. Summers stated, the question that is raised by this case is purely one of statutory construction, whether a judicial order entered with the consent of the employer is subject to the remedial limitations imposed by Section 706(g) of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.203" offset="4049416">Section 706(g) prescribes all remedial orders, all remedial court orders that grant preferential treatment to nonvictims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.950" offset="4096332">This victim-specific limitation on a court's Title 7 remedial power is in no way relaxed where the employer consents to the entry of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.498" offset="4138545">Neither the language nor the legislative history of Section 706(g) lends itself to a selective reading of the phrase, "no order of the court", and it is simply not the case that the explicit statutory constraint on a court's authority to order into place one discriminatory selection process to counteract another, that that constraint can be bargained away at the expense of innocent third parties by an employer who considers it to be in its interest to consent to a decree that provides for discrimination in reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.383" offset="6430111">The plaintiff and the defendants have different perspectives in this case, and therefore we have agreed to divide our argument, and the Court actually granted that motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.673" offset="6487267">When Congress... Vanguards here assert two points and I will address both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.076" offset="6512867">When Congress enacted Title 7, it gave the federal courts broad authority to remedy discrimination, including the authority to use race-conscious remedies in appropriate circumstances, and second, this Court should treat a consent decree, which includes race-conscious affirmative action as voluntary action in accordance with Weber not as court-imposed relief, and it does not make a difference that the petitioner did not consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.865" offset="6620074">Now, before turning to the merits of my argument, I would like to address a couple of factual points that came up during the preceding 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.890" offset="6648181">First, there is simply no dispute on the record that for years the City of Cleveland has discriminated against minorities and that a remedy was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.463" offset="6678483">There is no argument also that this remedy is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.826" offset="6691858">In response to Justice Powell's question earlier, there is clearly nothing in this decree that requires the promotion of unqualified individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.461" offset="6726444">As a matter of fact, passing a promotional examination is a prerequisite to minority and non-minority promotion alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.918" offset="6756224">In addition, I would point out that there is nothing on the record to show that this particular remedy, this particular affirmative action plan actually denies any non-minorities any promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.857" offset="6812021">One thing is clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.175" offset="6817246">That is, the city created substantially more promotions, and this is conceded by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.139" offset="6841174">The city created substantially more promotions to accommodate the interests of both minorities and non-minorities alike, and there is no indication that any particular non-minority was denied a promotion in favor of a minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.895" offset="6928110">To that extent, Justice Rehnquist, the remedy does affect who gets the promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.909" offset="6952247">My point is simply that without this consent decree, the non-minorities would not have received the promotions anyway.</text>

I realize that my time is up, Mr. Chief Justice, and I would simply add, if I may, and I have the understanding of my colleague that I may complete my thought, it simply does not make a difference to third parties whether they file a separate independent action or whether they frame their objections as they did here within the context of an intervention, in a fairness hearing, in framing their lawfulness objections, and they are precluded from relitigating and filing a second action to relitigate those same issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.998" offset="10752541">The number they want you to impose is zero, no race-conscious relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.662" offset="10771244">That is their preference today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.478" offset="10814503">In 1972, when Congress extended the reach to state and local governments and empowered the Justice Department, the Justice Department in the next eleven years settled 88 percent of those cases by a consent decree like the one we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.750" offset="10879600">That is not quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.060" offset="10888795">Not like the one we have today, and the reason is, if you look at the materials filed with the Court, the favorite number of the Justice Department in all those years was 50 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.576" offset="10922859">That is the ratio they liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.216" offset="10929442">That is the race-conscious relief they liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.919" offset="10936234">As a matter of fact, as recently as 1983, in the San Diego County case, the Justice Department approved 60 percent race conscious relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.107" offset="11045008">Another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.347" offset="11049919">In this case every governmental amicus has filed on behalf of the side of the City of Cleveland.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.713" offset="11087430">The City of Cleveland during that time was just like many of the other cities confronted with meeting its obligations under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.889" offset="11124106">For 14 years, as is indicated in this record, we had the Sealco case filed in 1972, we had the Heddon case, which was firefighters, in 1973, adjudications by Federal District Judges of violations of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments in 1981 and 1983, Title 7 not involved in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.032" offset="11204668">In 1977, Judge Manos also made such a finding, so when this case was filed in 1980, the City of Cleveland had eight years at that point of litigating these types of cases, and eight years of having judges rule against the City of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.284" offset="11269765">You don't have to beat us on the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.604" offset="11278960">We finally learned what we had to do and what we had to try to do to comply with the law, and it was the intent of the city to comply with the law fully in entering this consent agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.980" offset="11320547">We were faced again with claims under the Thirteenth, Fourteenth Amendments, 1981, 1983, and Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.244" offset="11345520">We had already been adjudicated under all of those other provisions not included in Title 7 of discrimination, and the exact type of relief afforded in this case was imposed on the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.124" offset="11397034">The question here is, can cities and local governments and defendants be able to settle these types of cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.529" offset="11430679">I submit that it is essential that we be able to settle them, and I don't think we can with the construction of 706(g) which is being urged by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.355" offset="11474043">I think the 706(g) construction of the legislative intent regarding 706(g) was best expressed by the Justice Department in 1979 in their brief in this case, in Weber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.844" offset="11523989">In that case, they said, Section 706(g) provides substantial support for the proposition that Congress intended numerical race-conscious relief is available under Title 7 to remedy employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.933" offset="11576338">That is the Justice Department's brief in Weber at Page 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.695" offset="11595355">This is a case to remedy the effects of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.349" offset="11617925">That is not make whole relief under which there is any sort of limitation under 706(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.384" offset="11638092">The plain reading of 706(g), I think, supports that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.377" offset="11658049">The focus has been on the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.658" offset="11667244">I do not believe that proper statutory construction allows one to ignore the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.102" offset="11685008">In the first sentence it says, if the court finds that respondent, focusing on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.205" offset="11705383">The first sentence doesn't talk about individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.356" offset="11714056">It is talking about a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.078" offset="11720848">It is talking about race-conscious prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.809" offset="11731819">If the court finds that respondent has intentionally engaged or is intentionally engaging in unlawful employment practices, and I paraphrase and skip down, affirmative action... that term is used in dealing with respondents... as may be appropriate, which may include but is not limited to, and it lists certain types of affirmative action, or any other equitable relief as the court may deem appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.624" offset="11823039">It is clear to me, I believe, as it was to the Justice Department in 1979 that Congress did not mean to strip Federal District Courts of their equitable authority to deal with these types of complex problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.760" offset="11875597">How complex are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.922" offset="11880299">This type of remedy, as is evident from the record in this case, has been used regularly and has been approved by every single Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.138" offset="11917184">Not one has said that race-conscious prospective relief is inappropriate either under Title 7 or under 1981 in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.374" offset="11950098">Now, the policy that is being urged that there can be no prospective race-conscious relief in my opinion reduces Title 7 to little more than an employment torts claims act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.853" offset="12004015">They talk about make whole, victim-specific.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.869" offset="12768044">As a matter of fact, if you compare the first consent decree with the second consent decree, we added more than the number of non-minority promotions to make up for the number of promotions that existed under the prior consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.395" offset="12814124">Not one non-minority did not get promoted in the initial waves of promotions because of that consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.559" offset="12838784">The city took the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.999" offset="12844531">We made more promotions than we wanted to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.222" offset="12853517">We made more promotions, in fact, than we needed to make in order to work with the trial judge to accommodate and minimize the burden in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.108" offset="12889043">I think other potential ramifications here will be an increased disruption, and that is the most important thing to us here today, the disruption of state and local governments' ability to run a fire department, as happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.398" offset="12954141">The judge impounded the examinations for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.592" offset="12970963">In other cases, we have had preliminary injunctions for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.643" offset="12983189">You cannot run and operate a safety force by having such judicial disruption, however well justified or intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.321" offset="13021850">This consent order alleviated that for the period of four to five years, so that we could attempt to make the promotions that both minority and non-minority wanted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.257" offset="13065631">I do not think this Court wishes to adopt a procedure or policy which will inhibit defendants from settling these types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.846" offset="13119966">It is clear to me that Congressional intent was and should be to settle these cases, to work those problems out at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.349" offset="13145984">Judge Lambrose, who handled this case in the trial court, was very experienced in handling these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.593" offset="13170957">As is evident in Williams versus Vukovich, he denied a consent order, and the Court of Appeals affirmed that denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.378" offset="13202095">So, he is not a judge that is not very considerate of the equities to everyone, and he certainly was very sensitive to them in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.805" offset="13239816">In summary, I think this Court should adhere to the language in Milliken that the court in fashioning a remedy should be sensitive to the needs of state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.857" offset="13312018">The trial court did that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.324" offset="13665925">In the order it says that manning and staffing shall never be considered in this affirmative action plan, so they can make as many jobs as they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.401" offset="13702183">But in the footnote to our reply brief, I would ask that you look at it, Page 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.123" offset="13721096">In 1976, there were 26 percent of the fire force were in the officer, promoted officer ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.729" offset="13755473">In 1986, there is 26 percent promoted rank membership on that fire service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.846" offset="13787969">Now, the old saying about figures can lie and liars can figure, there is the same percentage of individuals in the promoted ranks in the fire service in the City of Cleveland this year than there was ten years ago, so where's all these new jobs?</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.203" offset="13841363">Those jobs that they are talking about, and I have added one page to my reply brief, was because there is some illusion here that maybe some litigation, and maybe even it was affirmative action litigation, kept promotions from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.752" offset="13899564">Not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.834" offset="13903953">And testimony produced by the plaintiff in this matter shows that that wasn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.736" offset="13923492">There was a bad, mechanically bad test given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.698" offset="13935404">That was contested in state courts and held up the promotions because the city didn't give promotions between 1972 and 1975, and then again between '75 and '81, even though the law says that every two years upon the expiration of a list they should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.629" offset="14003114">Now, when they assert to this Court that, well, we made more jobs and therefore what was the wrong, the wrong is, in every single individual, minority or non-minority, if his job is taken away from him by the operation of 706(g) interpreting a court order to say, you won it, you won it fair and square, but you are not going to get it, that is not what 706(g) meant to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.670" offset="14127248">And, Mr. Justice Brennan, you questioned the meaning and the intent of Representative Seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.825" offset="14151907">In the government's brief on Page 9, he is quoted there that he expressly responded to the charge that federal courts and agencies would order quotas and other forms of preferential treatment under Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.570" offset="14194852">Noting that a court order could be entered only on proof, he was quoted as saying that the particular employer involved had in fact discriminated against one or more of his employees because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.540" offset="14246784">Representative Seller emphasized even then the court could not order that any preference be given to any particular race, but we would be limited to ordering an end to discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.536" offset="14290774">The citation to the Congressional Record is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.977" offset="14300492">Folks, I started off by saying this is a question of statutory construction.</text>
