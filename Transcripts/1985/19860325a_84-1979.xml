            <text syncTime="18.385" offset="213680">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.890" offset="255685">The primary question in this case is whether a corporate employer is automatically liable under Title VII for a supervisor's sexual advances toward a subordinate even though the employer did not know about the advances and never had a chance to stop them.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.914" offset="339800">The district court, after taking eleven days of evidence, found that the employee had suffered no Title VII discrimination and it rendered judgment against her.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.403" offset="389746">The district court also found that the bank had no notice of the supervisor's alleged discrimination and therefore it could not be liable as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.260" offset="437184">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.264" offset="453275">Let me turn to the specific facts of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.796" offset="471352">Ms. Vinson, plaintiff in this case, went to work as a teller trainee at one of the bank's branch offices in September 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.073" offset="516492">Over the next four years, she was promoted to teller, head teller, and finally to assistant branch manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.010" offset="548257">It was undisputed at trial that these promotions were based on merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.853" offset="567587">Ms. Vinson's immediate supervisor throughout this period was Sidney L. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.596" offset="590575">Mr. Taylor was the branch manager and an assistant vice president.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.219" offset="613040">At trial Ms. Vinson claimed that she and Mr. Taylor began a sexual affair in May 1975, to which she consented out of fear of losing her job.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.949" offset="663927">She claimed that for the next two and one-half years Mr. Taylor repeatedly demanded sex from her and otherwise harassed her physically and verbally.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.446" offset="710007">But she admitted that she never complained to the bank about Mr. Taylor, even though she herself was a supervisory employee and had regular contact with higher bank officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.455" offset="769984">Mr. Taylor denied having a sexual relationship with her, and he further denied all of her accusations of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.151" offset="804779">He offered evidence that just before Ms. Vinson left the bank and filed this lawsuit that they had had a continuing dispute about her failure to carry out his instructions to train a new teller.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.672" offset="866846">The bank showed that it had a written policy expressly prohibiting sex discrimination and had appointed one of its senior officials as its EEO officer to enforce the non-discrimination policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.923" offset="935914">It also had a written grievance procedure for resolving employee complaints.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Robert Troll, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="224.121" offset="1036642">Although I don't think it's part of the record, it is my understanding that he is still employed with the bank and is still at the branch premises where the alleged incidents occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.966" offset="1080005">The bank denied that Ms. Vinson or anyone else had ever complained about any harassment or any other discriminatory activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.843" offset="1123577">The bank also showed that Ms. Vinson had been offered routine transfers away from Mr. Taylor to other bank departments, but that she had turned these down.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.781" offset="1171329">Judge Penn found that Ms. Vinson's participation in any sexual affair with her supervisor, if indeed there was one, was voluntary and had nothing to do with employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.580" offset="1230471">In so finding, Judge Penn necessarily disbelieved her testimony about Mr. Taylor's harassment and coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.796" offset="1271326">In fact, the court pointedly referred to testimony from one of Ms. Vinson's own witnesses, a co-worker, who said that Ms. Vinson did not appear to be afraid of Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.867" offset="1331617">Judge Penn also expressly found that the bank was without notice of any sexual improprieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.474" offset="1370069">The court said... and I'm reading from Judge Penn's findings:</text>
            <text syncTime="312.756" offset="1391176">"The alleged sexual harassment involving Mechelle Vinson was not reported by her or by anyone on her behalf to the police or to any officials at the association. "</text>
            <text syncTime="329.769" offset="1459199">And he also said:</text>
            <text syncTime="332.751" offset="1471215">"Mechelle Vinson never filed an informal or formal grievance against defendant Sidney L. Taylor, pursuant to the Association's employee manual. "</text>
            <text syncTime="344.479" offset="1518131">The district court's findings of fact not only support, but indeed compel, the conclusions both that Ms. Vinson was not the victim of sexual harassment and that the bank could not be liable for Mr. Taylor's conduct without having been placed on some form of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.645" offset="1622725">Despite these findings, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.742" offset="1659192">First, the Court of Appeals said that the trial court failed to consider whether the employee had a claim based on a sexually offensive work environment, even though she lost no promotions or other job benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.121" offset="1732648">Second, the Court of Appeals said that evidence of the employee's own voluntary sexual behavior at work should not have been admitted at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.450" offset="1781968">Third and most unsettling, the Court of Appeals stated that an innocent employer is liable automatically for a supervisor's sexual conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.529" offset="1838288">Mr. Troll, do you concede that the trial court simply didn't handle the case as one involving a recognition of a sexual harassment or hostile environment type claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="456.833" offset="1967542">So you agree that the district court really didn't try the case with that theory in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.919" offset="2131800">I notice that the Solicitor General in an amicus brief suggests that there is such a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.634" offset="2166699">It is our position that if there is some form of tangible job benefit over and above pure psychological or emotional harm, that yes, there would indeed exist such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.872" offset="2219675">But in analyzing that particular issue in the case, it appears to us, as we've argued in our brief, that Congress was concerned with tangible economic loss, not with psychological or emotional injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.173" offset="6416822">It encourages employees to speak up promptly, rather than to suffer in silence, and it permits the employer to end the problem before it worsens, and it encourages employers to address the problem because if they do they exonerate themselves from Title VII liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.132" offset="6592678">But there is something, we submit, very unfair about hailing an innocent employer into court for a problem that it was unaware of and would have corrected voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.118" offset="6644609">We submit that Title VII calls upon the court to do equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.212" offset="6669060">It is contrary to equity to hold an innocent employer automatically liable where the complainant has waited in silence and intensified her injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.496" offset="9854118">"It is without question that sexual harassment of female employees in which they are asked or required to submit to sexual demands as a condition to obtain employment... as a condition to obtain employment... or to maintain employment or to obtain promotions falls within the protection of Title VII.

            <text syncTime="2448.559" offset="9934366">He obviously, that is the trial court, and for good reason... the guidelines had not yet come out; they came out in April of '80, he decided this case in January of '80, and Bundy had not been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.077" offset="9980446">So he was not thinking in terms of, well, what about noxious environment, poisoned with sexual innuendoes, insults, aggressive behavior that was unwanted, that in this case let to a constructive discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.635" offset="11910686">Yes, and for that reason we're arguing that in this particular case, because of what I've just argue to you, Justice Rehnquist, it was wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.551" offset="11946422">Again, I would like to say we're not saying you cannot exclude evidence of how she comported herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.706" offset="11979022">But in this case the environment was the supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.159" offset="11992815">Therefore, how she conducted herself towards the supervisor is the kind of evidence that would be directly relevant and on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.793" offset="12023326">And in fact, the trial court said over and over again that, I want to hear what happened between Ms. Vinson and Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.449" offset="12053942">And only when they brought in this general sexual character evidence did he say that now a very broad-based kind of evidence would be allowed to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.235" offset="12097096">But also underlying that assumption, as I understand the arguments of the Petitioner, Justice Rehnquist, is that the evidence is being proffered for two reasons: either because she fantasized the charges, which is the bank's position and Mr. Taylor's position, the acts never occurred; or it's evidence that, in case you decide to believe her that something happened, that she volunteered to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.592" offset="12194585">So what we have in this case is just not alternative pleadings, but alternative proof of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.064" offset="12216423">It either has to go in on one theory or it has to go in on the other, and they have argued in their brief on both theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.039" offset="12248293">Now, if they're saying that this was evidence of voluntary work place conduct that proved that the relationship was a consensual one, then what they're saying, Justice Rehnquist, is that their own supervisor committed perjury in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.670" offset="12302836">And for that reason, we have to lock carefully at this evidence, because maybe the Court of Appeals was right, the trial court used that evidence, as it say, to jump the gun and say, well, whatever happened, it had to be voluntary and I don't really care what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.867" offset="12363649">It's very important in this case to determine what happened, and if we're allowed to go back on remand that would be the first responsibility of the trier of fact, to determine who is credible in this case, who is telling the truth with respect to the most important issue: Was it Mr. Taylor or was it Ms. Vinson?</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.300" offset="14109360">Very briefly, the reason why notice to Mr. Taylor is not notice to the bank is that notice to the actual perpetrator in and of itself can never constitute notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.158" offset="14160769">The perpetrator is motivated to keep his conduct secret and to keep it concealed from his superiors, who may discipline him for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.658" offset="14214791">This rule requiring notice is particularly heightened in this form of sexual harassment case, where one on one conduct occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.596" offset="14262542">Simply put, the victim knows that notice will more than likely not come from her supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.341" offset="14289501">If she wishes relief, she must complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.102" offset="14304547">In the example given, I think, where a complaint is made to a vice president, notice can never go to the perpetrator, but it can in fact go to an EEO officer or somebody higher up, or even to the EEOC.</text>
