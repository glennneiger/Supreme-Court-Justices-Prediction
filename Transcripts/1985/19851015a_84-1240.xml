            <text syncTime="78.433" offset="442333">The issue in this matter is whether exceptional circumstances exist to justify the stay, referring to the current state action in this pure diversity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="504296">In the San Carlos Apache case, the dismissal was upheld because the state's suits were adequate to quantify the rights, water rights of the Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.003" offset="668658">The reasoning mentioned there to some great extent was that the concurrent federal proceedings as duplicative and wasteful, generating additional litigation through inconsistent disposition of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.346" offset="729994">And, number two, the concurrent proceedings creates a serious potential for spawning an unseemly and destructive waste to see which forum can resolve the same issues first prejudicial to the possibility of recent decision-making by either forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.843" offset="803973">In the Moses Cone Hospital case, the stay reversal was affirmed because the piecemeal litigation was not avoided as to the architect in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.318" offset="853919">The priority measured by progress in the suits was not in favor of stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.721" offset="991532">The court was guided in the Moses Cone case by the federal policy and law to not delay arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.161" offset="1033223">The court noted specifically that vexatious or reactive nature of suits may influence the decision as to whether to defer to the concurrent state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.836" offset="1091946">This occurred not only in the Moses Cone case in the Court of Appeals, but also in the Calvert case and was mentioned by this Court as having considerable merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.846" offset="1152028">In the Colorado River case, the dismissal was upheld because the McCarran Amendment federal policy to avoid piecemeal litigation of water rights in a river system.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.373" offset="1206049">Number two, the absence of proceedings beyond the complaint; number three, particularly the extensive involvement of state water rights involving numerous defendants and the distance between state court and Denver and the Division Seven location of the size of the water right; and number five, the existing participation of U.S. in other similar state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.321" offset="1305837">There, the particular language relating to the basis for justifying the stay derives.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.113" offset="1349096">The court said the issue must be decided on the basis of wise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.538" offset="1406774">The court noted the virtual unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.644" offset="1439166">The court also noted that the reasons of wise judicial administration are more limited and exceptional and the court indicated that there must be a weighing of factors with only the clearest of justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.940" offset="1516384">The scales were described as consider the obligation to exercise as opposed to factors counseling against exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.430" offset="1566330">The factors in this case are, number one, the priority of assuming jurisdiction of property, the question of in rem application.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.577" offset="1646892">This question has never been specifically an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.897" offset="1672178">Roberts &amp; Schaefer says the state action is in personam and I simply point out that that was deliberately so by Roberts Schaefer.</text>

Of course, Younger, Berford and the other abstention cases are bottomed on the concept of the separation of the federal government and state government and the operation of the state government, the non-interference, the non-intrusion of the federal government into the vital affairs of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.225" offset="11545524">And, I agree with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.712" offset="11563496">Now, when I start having a little trouble is with Colorado River and Arizona, because in Colorado River and in Arizona the Court used the exceptional circumstances test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.556" offset="11630787">In my mind, exceptional circumstances is almost tantamount to discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.863" offset="11672061">It may be discretion, although the Court very pointedly says that it is the narrowest of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.302" offset="11705811">And, again, I am back to the constitutional problem, the jurisdictional problem, of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.456" offset="11734441">Certainly in the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Brillhart case, the Congress granted the discretion and the court exercised it and this Court upheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.633" offset="11795150">So, I would suggest that Colorado River and Arizona maybe are closer akin, or what we in Kentucky call kissing cousins, of Berford and some of the civil counterparts of Younger where the state has a vital interest, because having practiced for a short time in Arizona, I know what water rights mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.258" offset="11945615">And, as this Court pointed out in Arizona, that is a very... I forget the terminology, but it is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.433" offset="12002353">And, here, Colorado and Arizona were attempting to establish through the state court system a pattern of water rights which this Court held provided exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.864" offset="12084064">I would suggest that maybe more appropriate it should have been intrusion into areas that should be reserved for the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.654" offset="12131189">And, I would suggest that if... I don't think it is a discretion, but I think the federal courts, when they come into an area of that sort, they should look into it and make a determination, a finding of fact, if you please, not a discretion, but a finding of fact as to whether there will be an intrusion into the vital functions of the state which might well be contrary to the comity between the federal government and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.171" offset="12333272">Now, the state law issue, I think, should be put to rest and I think can be put to rest very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.860" offset="12372038">That is what Erie is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.562" offset="12382800">That is what the diversity statute is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.447" offset="12398369">If we were to stay every case because it is based on state law, we would repeal the diversity statute and we all know that is an area reserved for the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.026" offset="12484678">Conservation of judicial time: That is extremely interesting to me because ten years ago this very month I was standing here in the same spot defending Judge Hermensdorfer and Judge Hermensdorfer didn't have time and he was serious and he meant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.594" offset="12590944">But, this Court wisely determined that the Congress had spoken, that the conferring of jurisdictions in diversity of removal cases was a mandate of the Congress which he should have heeded and ordered him to heed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.428" offset="12702330">Certainly, these things are sometimes wasteful, waste of time, waste of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.701" offset="12735453">Maybe there should be better ways, but again that addresses itself to the Congress and not to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.275" offset="12789684">Another thing that bothers me is... Of course, the Microsoftware case I mentioned a moment ago, I misnamed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.306" offset="12885814">Another matter I would like to cover briefly is diversity jurisdiction and its relationship to federal questions, civil rights, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.666" offset="12951225">I mention in my brief and I would like to emphasize now that I know of no jurisdictional pecking order, I know of no jurisdictional statute that says diversity shall be tried first, second, or third, whether it should be number one or number ten on the list of one to ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.717" offset="13051431">And, I think in the absence of a congressional expression, we must treat each jurisdictional... each conferring in jurisdiction as a congressional mandate of at least equal equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.714" offset="13135440">The jurisdiction that I advocate today happens to be a senior citizen, the most senior of all, I suppose, but certainly the mere factor that it may have here and may not even be in great favor in a lot of places, doesn't mean that it is to be condemned or moved to the back of the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.798" offset="13247767">Certainly, as a senior citizen, it is entitled to as much consideration and is entitled to go forward with at least the same deliberate speed to adjudication as any other jurisdiction unless the Congress mandates otherwise as it has in a few instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.914" offset="13348286">It distresses me to see judgments made by the individual districts or even the circuits as to which should take precedence, which should be first, which should be second, which should ninth, which should be tenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.410" offset="13434281">I think that is a political decision for the Congress and not for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.699" offset="13463434">I would suggest that all jurisdictional mandates move forward equally unless and until the Congress dictates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.392" offset="13534173">I notice the Colorado District in Local Rule 200 says that diversity actions will be given the lowest priority and will be heard and tried when, as, and if time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.574" offset="13626856">Again, I suggest that is a judgment for the Congress and not for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.798" offset="13667816">I am suggesting that the Sixth Circuit has decided the case correctly, has decided that the congressional mandate of the Congress should be enforced and has properly reversed the district court with directions to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.663" offset="13763215">If the Court has nothing further, may I be excused?</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.590" offset="13819013">I wish first to say again with respect to the piecemeal litigation issue and the finding by the Court of Appeals that Lake did not have an arguably valid claim against the subcontractors, and, therefore, there was no piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.490" offset="13926533">Let me point out to this Court that the district judge in this case found that piecemeal litigation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.065" offset="13980867">Not only did the Court of Appeals find that it did not exist but the district judge found that it did exist specifically in his stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.141" offset="14033217">The question is not whether the Court of Appeals made that finding and could make that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.949" offset="14080446">The question is whether or not the Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.501" offset="14098627">The issue is whether or not the district judge abused his discretion in finding that piecemeal litigation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.190" offset="14129347">And, yes, this Court must determine whether or not the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling that the district judge abused his discretion in finding that piecemeal litigation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.267" offset="14189638">The district judge, it must be realized, impliedly found in the stay request that Lake had an arguably valid claim against the subcontractors as he had--</text>
