            <text syncTime="10.318" offset="166302">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.201" offset="181871">The Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime pay requirements do not apply to someone who is "employed as a seaman".</text>
            <text syncTime="24.056" offset="221264">The Act does not define the term "employed as a seaman".</text>
            <text syncTime="30.049" offset="245296">However, administrative and court interpretations have clarified that the term "seaman" is not limited to what we would ordinarily think of as sailors... skippers, deck crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.658" offset="295765">It includes other members of a ship's crew... its cooks, its pursers, and, pertinent here, its engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.056" offset="333277">The question is the case is whether marine engineers aboard a seagoing processing vessel were correctly categorized as seamen and therefore paid a fixed salary without allowance for overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.268" offset="406106">The issue this morning is whether the Ninth Circuit under the appropriate standard of review correctly substituted its own determination that these engineers are not seamen because they primarily perform not maritime but industrial duties, on the trial judge's determination that the engineers or the Arctic Star were employed as seamen because the nature of their work was maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.207" offset="521881">The Court of Appeals' degree of freedom to substitute its own determination in this regard depends in our analysis upon whether that Court disagreed with the trial judge's understanding of how to define the term "employed as a seaman", in which case it would be free to substitute its own definition, or whether it disagreed with the district court's interpretation of the facts, in which case it would be required to pay deference to the trial judge's findings under the clearly erroneous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.351" offset="674436">Here our contention is and the record shows the Court of Appeals did not fault the district court for misunderstanding the definition of the term "employed as a seaman".</text>
            <text syncTime="150.988" offset="729084">There wasn't doubt about that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.282" offset="738175">It was well established that someone is employed as a seaman of he is</text>
            <text syncTime="159.514" offset="763148">"a member of a ship's crew whose work is primarily maritime. "</text>
            <text syncTime="164.690" offset="783837">What the Ninth Circuit disagreed with was the trial judge's determination that the work of these engineers was primarily maritime, and substituted its own determination that the maritime work was only incidental to primary duties which were in essence industrial maintenance.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.336" offset="1442436">And indeed, the Administrator's regulations specifically deal with that kind of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.571" offset="1531357">The distinction that developed from the cases is whether the particular workers that are at issue are part of that vessel's crew, meaning their work is to maintain that vessel, or whether they are really floating miners, whether their work really is to be part of the dredging crew and the vessel carries them to their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.785" offset="1620173">That's the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.498" offset="2479079">Initially, it felt that the determination of the whole question of what is seaman status is a question of law, and boldly in its first opinion said: this is a question of law and we are free to substitute our determination for that of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.796" offset="2536235">We moved for a rehearing en banc, challenging that independence and pointing out that it was contrary to the established standard of review in such questions in the Supreme Court and in the Ninth Circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.925" offset="2584823">And in a revised opinion, the Ninth Circuit did this, very similar in our opinion to what occurred in the Pullman-Standard versus Swint case which was here a couple of years back.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.093" offset="2633411">The opinion acknowledges there is some role for trial court findings which are subject to limited scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.827" offset="2660369">But what it did was to substitute its own fact findings all the same, without finding the trial court's findings were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.324" offset="2698403">It is true that the Ninth Circuit in its revised opinion said that it was applying a de novo standard of review only to the application of this exemption to the facts, but I submit to you that there was no area of disagreement between the Ninth Circuit and the trial court which the Ninth Circuit could have properly reviewed de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.741" offset="9532036">Briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.352" offset="9534439">Sometimes the Star is at anchor while it's processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.445" offset="9550844">That's part of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.015" offset="9557113">Other times the Arctic Star is under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.078" offset="9569443">Granted, not by its own power, being pulled, tugged by a tugboat, but it is under way in the open seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.991" offset="9593058">It takes voyages, according to the transcript, as long as 13 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.126" offset="9609567">It carries its crew as passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.927" offset="9620748">It will sometimes even carry the fishing boats themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.839" offset="9632451">It carries cargo in the hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.690" offset="9643840">It is for all intents and purposes on oceangoing vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.982" offset="9660976">It just doesn't have its own engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.454" offset="9666932">Now, there are aspects in one respect, there are aspects in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.667" offset="9687726">It's a question of evaluating and interpreting the facts across the board and not focusing just on one or just on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.025" offset="9729208">The rule of Walling versus General Industries was that a trial court, by this Court, is that a trial court's findings that a particular worker because of his duties is exempt, there as an executive, should be left undisturbed unless clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.776" offset="9796186">The Ninth Circuit in its opinion attempted to distinguish the rule in Walling versus General Industries, just as Mr. Eller has, as having involved a question of overturning a trial court's evaluations following disputed testimony... credibility, in a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.995" offset="9861074">The opinions of this Court are plain now that, while credibility, ability to observe the credibility of witnesses, is one factor that puts a trial court in a better position to evaluate testimony, it is not the sole reason that trial court finding are to be left undisturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.648" offset="9943621">The rule, after all, has two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.201" offset="9949891">It says that those fact findings are to be left undisturbed unless clearly erroneous and... not if... there is a dispute over credibility, and the trial court's ability to judge credibility is also to be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.130" offset="10001613">The second certainly doesn't limit the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.991" offset="10009032">In a nutshell, the record could have been read either way, at the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.341" offset="10026482">The trial court read it one way, the Ninth Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.955" offset="10036931">When it can be read in either way and it involves essentially an interpretation of the facts, under the correct standard of review the trial court should have been reversed only if clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.472" offset="10083011">The Ninth Circuit didn't do it, and the trial court in any event was not clearly erroneous in what it found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.925" offset="10108820">Thank you.</text>
