            <text syncTime="244.694" offset="1118749">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.982" offset="1123869">First of all, the entire school lands trust was created at one time in 1817 in Mississippi's enabling Act and the Land Sales Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.619" offset="1162426">The Land Sales Act provided that the 16 section lands were to be retained throughout the state in trust for the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.384" offset="1197430">Then, in the sale of the lands in what is called the Chickasaw Cession, the 23 counties that we represent, rather than retain the lands in trust, as was supposed to be done, they sold them and gave the money to the Indians, and not to the state.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. H. Freeland, III</label>
            <text syncTime="283.679" offset="1274648">That is correct, and of course the United States government realized what it had done, subsequently passed a statute that said, we are going to give the state 177,555 acres of new lands to replace these lands that we wrongfully, if you will, sold to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.641" offset="1358553">Thereafter, after this happened, the State of Mississippi first leased these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.935" offset="1387706">They are in the Mississippi Delta, some of the richest farmland in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.647" offset="1398573">They leased these lands, and following that, the Congress in 1852 passed a statute that said, you can now sell the lands provided you retain the funds, proceeds of the sale in trust for the schools, or as an alternative you can lease the lands, but if you do, if you do sell the lands, you have got to get permission of the counties where... that would benefit from the lands in order to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.845" offset="1503271">Of course, the state never did do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.577" offset="1510272">In 1856, the state comes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.138" offset="1520512">They... well, first, in 1854 they gave away the reversionary interest in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.731" offset="1542873">They had the lands leased for 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.223" offset="1552800">They said, we will give you a fee simple title for no additional charge, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.246" offset="1568891">This was Delta land.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.656" offset="1574533">Subsequent to that, in 1856, the state said, okay, we have got something over $1 million in a fund in the state treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.491" offset="1601910">They by statute converted that to the use of the state, and put it in the general fund, and spent it just like they would any other money in the general fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.217" offset="1632839">In other words, the trustee gave away the corpus of the trust or converted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.620" offset="1646422">Now, the same statute that you are referring to, I believe, does talk about lending money to the railroads, a highly speculative venture in Mississippi in 1856, but that was done after the money was converted to the use of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.266" offset="5920995">We are asking this Court to declare that this is in fact the trust, something that the court has done each and every time it has ever had an opportunity to rule on the question, and that the law governing the trust, because it is created by federal law, is, of course, federal law, and the trust is enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.250" offset="6004901">In other words, the short answer to what we want is for the trustees to honor their obligations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.795" offset="6035098">To argue, as the state does, that the Eleventh Amendment bars any such remedy or the trustee's diminution of the trust corpus is to say that there is no trust at all, contrary to the statutes which created it, that there is no enforceable continuing duty, nothing that can be enforced in federal court, that any claim under federal law would have to be left to the tender mercies of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.657" offset="6170517">The Fifth Circuit's holding is nothing less than that this trust is simply not there because they said there is no continuing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.444" offset="6213671">Granted, says the Fifth Circuit, there was a valid compact created 130 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.269" offset="6241048">What we are looking at now is some weird creature that has to do with Mississippi trust law, and they flatly refuse to enforce the continuing duty, and really that is what this lawsuit is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.518" offset="6297995">If this is a trust, and we certainly contend that it is, the it follows as the night the day that the trustees of this trust, and those are the people that we are suing, are obliged to honor it, and as part of that they are obliged to pay or see that the trust income is properly divided or paid in the future from some source, and they can be made to do that because they are acting in derogation of federal law and they are acting in derogation of the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.821" offset="6439265">We submit that they could be made to do that by this Court, and that indeed they should be made to do that by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.884" offset="9947510">Some school districts have vast mineral wealth under them, under their 16th Section lands, and they have leased that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.369" offset="9973423">Of course, prices have been falling lately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.290" offset="9981051">I think these figures may change around based on some changes in the economic pattern here in the last few months or years for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.864" offset="10015428">Another point I would like to make is the Chickasaw Cession counties are getting an appropriation from the state, albeit it only $66,000, 66 percent of the corpus on the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.225" offset="10076868">They are getting something that not another county or school district in the state gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.158" offset="10100587">They are getting, as we say, a land... something they are getting that no one else is getting there from the state--</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.076" offset="10140293">So I think that when we look at it from the standpoint that the state allows the local school districts to manage their own 16th Section lands subject to state oversight to make sure there is no donation of the land or disposition of the land that is not permitted under state law under the constitution, that there is no unequal treatment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.805" offset="10263173">This Court has also said that the equal protection clause is not applicable, I believe, and geographical differentials there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.012" offset="10295983">It is between persons, and this is a geographical differential simply because the initial action of not reserving the 16th Section lands precipitated this whole lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.931" offset="10343631">That is what started it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.539" offset="10350109">The 16th Section lands were not reserved--</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.691" offset="10358677">Finally, some five or six years, seven years later, the state was allowed to select some lands, the Governor of the State, and that is the only thing that any named official in this complaint has ever done in regard to the Chickasaw Cession lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.811" offset="10411235">The federal government allowed the Governor to go out and select these lands in the Mississippi Delta which were virtually unsettled at the time, as I said, swamp and overflow land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.137" offset="11016440">One other matter we would point out to the Court at this time is that the... if the Court were to make the order that petitioners seek, we believe it would literally open the proverbial Pandora's Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.044" offset="11108078">Every school district in the southern district of the State of Mississippi would then sue the state, saying, well, another school district has got more money or more land or receives more income from there because of geographical variances than we do, so we will sue, and we will get our money back, or get some more money back, although we have sold our lands some years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.806" offset="12095193">In that regard, I believe the figures will show, the most recent figures show in the State of Mississippi approximately 62 or 63 percent, in that range, of the total state budget is directed to educational matters throughout the state and the public education in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.581" offset="12854311">They do that on more or less an equal basis, and that is another basis for our complaint, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.105" offset="12872388">How is it that they can give everybody the same amount of state money, and yet acting as trustees of the trust give us not one nickel of the trust income and say that they are treating us on any sort of rational, reasonable basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.425" offset="12937590">And then they point at Rodriguez and say, well, there wasn't any discrimination in Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.931" offset="12967683">Of course there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.000" offset="12971967">The case was tried, and that is what the trial court found, that the scheme in Rodriguez was facially neutral, but of course we allege here that we are dealing with rank discrimination, and that is what the pleadings have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.269" offset="13029018">The Eleventh Amendment, we contend that this claim concerns only continuing violations of federal statutory and constitutional law, and it falls therefore within the rules permitting suits alleging conduct contrary to the supreme authority of the United States, as this Court mentioned in Penhurst, or it said in Green versus Mansour, a recent opinion, that such prospective relief as we are looking for vindicates the authority of the United States, and that is all we ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.652" offset="13170497">We ask that this trust be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.106" offset="13180320">We don't ask the Court to interfere with the way schools are funded in Mississippi.</text>
