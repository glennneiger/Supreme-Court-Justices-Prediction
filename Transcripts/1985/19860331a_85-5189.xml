            <text syncTime="71.862" offset="424743">The issue in this case is whether an unloaded handgun is a dangerous weapon in violation of Section (d) of the Bank Robberty Statute 18 U.S.C. 2113.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="479809">There are two points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.122" offset="489840">First of all, that an unloaded handgun on the facts of this case is not and should not be a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.212" offset="518157">Secondly, that even if an unloaded handgun can be a dangerous weapon, it ought not to be determined to be a dangerous weapon by a decision of the Court of Appeals, but rather should remain a factual question for the factfinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.637" offset="579910">The facts in this case are extremely, concisely stated and are in pages eight to ten of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.160" offset="613974">The short of the matter is that Mr. McLaughlin and a co-defendant entered a bank and while the co-defendant emptied several teller stations of funds, Mr. McLaughlin remained in the lobby area of the bank, pointed a handgun generally at the people in the bank and told them not to move.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.833" offset="760678">The question is how will we determine for 2113(d) purposes that the gun was dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.106" offset="789726">Certainly if the gun was loaded the gun could inflict a harm that it threatens to inflict and under the courts that have applied an objective test that has been the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.414" offset="950954">Well, I think it is only dangerous, and this is certainly the analysis used by some of the courts, it is only dangerous if there is a threat to use it as a club.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.420" offset="987003">If the only threat is to use the gun as a gun and the gun does not work as a gun, the gun is not dangerous as a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.895" offset="1024932">Now, the courts that have adopted... like the Fourth Circuit... a presumption that any weapon, loaded or unloaded, used during a bank robbery is, as a matter of law, a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.468" offset="1075192">I have certainly reasoned that the fear of the victims, the potential for using the gun as a club, or the potential for third-party response, for example, by police forces, makes the situation dangerous, but should we reason from the situation back to the gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.430" offset="1147081">If we do, then even non-guns would be dangerous weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.068" offset="1165576">The person who goes into the bank, puts his hand in his pocket and claims that he has a gun could create the same amount of danger as the person who actually displays a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.439" offset="1207058">By the reasoning of those courts, a dangerous weapon has been used even though in one instance no weapon at all has been used.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.731" offset="1252302">Well, I think there you can say there is, in fact, no weapon or device, so that isn't covered, but certainly the legislative history of this particular language would indicate that the sponsor of it thought it would include fake guns, for example, does it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="300.245" offset="1338297">--Justice O'Connor, I think in one reading it does and I think in another reading, which is my reading, of course, that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.083" offset="1369644">Certainly the sponsor envisioned fake guns or what were referred to as Indiana six shooters or bottles of water claimed to be nitroglycerin, certainly they were included somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.891" offset="1416874">The question is where were they included?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.760" offset="1424397">One of the congressmen, I think the bill's sponsor, says, in response to questions about the fake weapon, that he does not object to the word 2 of the statute which at the time was bank robbery by trick or fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.590" offset="1507675">Also at the end of the legislative history which is extremely meager, the statement... the suggestion that instrumentalities which could cause fear was rejected as an amendment to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.480" offset="1559293">So, on one hand, I think, yes, the subject of fear of the victim was sought to be protected by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.134" offset="1581863">But, on the other hand, the question is how.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.253" offset="1590327">I think the Act can be read consistently with those courts who have applied an objective standard to amount to the following: If a weapon is used and that weapon is dangerous in itself or can carry out the harm that it threatens you have a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.096" offset="1657723">If it can't, then you might have bank robbery by trick, you might have assault on the teller, but you may not have a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.320" offset="1698578">The statute doesn't punish bank robbery with a weapon, it doesn't punish bank robbery with an apparently dangerous weapon, it doesn't punish bank robbery because a dangerous situation is created.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.592" offset="1739747">It punishes bank robbery during which an assault is committed using the dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.596" offset="1759705">If we reason from the assault--</text>

            <text syncTime="461.547" offset="1983522">He plead guilty to the (a) and (b) sections of that statute which prohibit the bank robbery assault and the bank larceny and we had a bench trial on the (d) section on the issue of, number one, the unloaded handgun and, number two, the Fourth Circuit's decision which makes it presumptive guilt if you have any weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.926" offset="2057083">When this Court decided Simpson in 1978, this Court applied the phrase "dangerous weapon" to both clauses, the assaultive clause and the putting-in-jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.101" offset="2117791">Much of the case law developed prior to that time and much of the case law reasons that an assault under (a) that one could reasonably determine to be an aggravated assault, if there was a weapon used amounted to a violation of (d), but it is unclear whether those courts read the dangerous weapon phrase as modifying the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.901" offset="2220923">After Simpson, when the courts had to read that, I think what has happened is, so as to not to lose the aggravated assault punishment, all of that case law was simply applied to the dangerous weapon in the following two ways:</text>
            <text syncTime="536.778" offset="2284452">Number one, if there is enough evidence for the jury to conclude the weapon was loaded it is a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.380" offset="2302843">We don't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.416" offset="2307022">Number two, the creation of presumptive... the creation of presumptions of dangerousness by the circuit court, the Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, possibly the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, have rules that state a weapon, loaded or unloaded, used during a bank robbery is a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.311" offset="2382568">There is no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.428" offset="2387061">The effect of that is read in the indictment of this case which is on page five of the Joint Appendix where Mr. McLaughlin is not charged with using a dangerous weapon, he is charged with brandishing that weapon, with pointing a firearm at the tellers in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.689" offset="2452054">If the jury or a factfinder concludes a weapon was used, and Mr. McLaughlin admitted one was, he is, therefore, guilt of using a dangerous weapon without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.611" offset="2491760">I do not think that that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.913" offset="2505030">I do think that that is a violation of Winship which was decided 16 years ago today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.165" offset="7462026">The government's position is that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon or device for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.385" offset="7486895">Our primary argument is that brandishing a gun during a bank robbery is likely to provoke violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.074" offset="7517615">Many courts have recognized that the display of an apparently deadly weapon in the highly charged atmosphere of a bank during a robbery may lead to retaliation, so that harm could occur in any of a number of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.084" offset="7573726">As one of the many state courts that has held that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon stated danger invites rescue and self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.321" offset="7606640">The Fourth Circuit noted in the Bennett case that frightened bystanders, security guards, or passing police officers might take precipitous action that could lead to harm to people in the bank at the time of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.247" offset="7662333">It is, therefore, sensible to punish robbers who display guns more severely than robbers who do not and we think that that was Congress' goal in enacting Section 2113(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.262" offset="8390418">Petitioner agrees, in his brief at page 12, that displaying an unloaded gun during a robbery is dangerous, but argues that Congress did not intend to punish bank robbers who create dangerous situations because Section 2113(d) refers only to dangerous weapons or devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.258" offset="8482369">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.758" offset="8488325">It seems obvious that Congress enacted that aggravated bank robbery provision in order to give enhanced punishment to robbers who act in ways that are more likely to create serious injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.768" offset="8544436">Furthermore, Petitioner neglects that Section 2113(d) refers to devices as well as to weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.755" offset="8576410">As the legislative history shows, Congress was concerned with the psychological effect of the display of a weapon on the minds of people in the bank at the time of the robbery and added the word device in order to make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.282" offset="8634506">As a secondary argument, we contend that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon or device within the meaning of the statute because it may be used as a bludgeon as a California court noted more than 50 years ago and as a number of courts have noted since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.643" offset="8703887">The display of a gun, whether loaded or unloaded, is a threat to inflict injury by means of beating someone and a robber displaying a gun is capable of carrying out that threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.451" offset="8759163">To make our position clear, I would like to consider one other example raised by Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.657" offset="8795943">He asked whether a metal club is a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.893" offset="8812870">We think that clearly it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.778" offset="8824469">We also think it is worth noting that a metal club is not nearly as useful as a weapon even if just used as a bludgeon as an unloaded gun is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.451" offset="8867100">An unloaded gun when pointed at someone will normally cause them to remain stationary so that a robber may walk over and hit them with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.224" offset="8902209">Brandishing a metal club in contrast is much less likely to cause a robber to remain stationary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.313" offset="8930630">that is why we think robbers use unloaded guns rather than metal clubs in robbing banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.717" offset="8960201">The legislative history confirms that Congress intended Section 2113(d) to prescribe the use of weapons having the apparent capability of inflicting harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.857" offset="9004818">The words (d) after an enlightening floor exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.047" offset="9037523">Representative Blanton feared that courts would not construe the phrase "dangerous weapon" broadly to cover devices such as fake bombs and fake guns and he proposed amending the provision to add the word "device" in order to make clear that it ought to apply in such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.311" offset="9122578">In fact, as an example of the sort of instrument that he thought ought to be covered, he referred to</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.714" offset="9148178">"one of those new kind of Indiana six shooters carved out of a piece of wood with a pocket knife. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.201" offset="9174196">He also noted that a bottle of water asserted to be nitroglycerin would have the same effect psychologically on the minds of the people in the bank as a real bomb.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.925" offset="10381053">He was acting on the submission of the government as to what they would prove if they had to go to trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="2567.946" offset="10409161">--I think that is right, Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.512" offset="10415430">Contrary to Petitioner's argument and the argument accepted by the district court in California that ruled contrary to the government, interpretation of the aggravated bank robbery provision to cover unloaded guns and fake weapons does not render redundant Section 2113(a), the straight bank robbery provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.016" offset="10525458">Aggravated bank robbery, which is punishable by five more years imprisonment than straight bank robbery, differs from straight bank robbery in that a dangerous weapon or device must be used to assault someone during the course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.791" offset="10592540">It is, of course, possible to rob a bank without the use of any weapon at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.845" offset="10612707">Robbers frequently pass notes to bank tellers demanding money, sometimes claiming that they have a weapon, when, in fact, they do not have any weapon at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.837" offset="10660668">Second, robbers sometimes grab bank employees and threaten to beat or strangle them if they are not given money and, of course, that doesn't involve the use of a weapon or device either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.412" offset="10715003">And, as I mentioned earlier, it may be later determined that a bank robber was actually carrying a weapon during a bank robbery, but he never displayed it during a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.435" offset="10759097">That does not seem to us to be the use of a weapon to assault anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.006" offset="10777383">So, while Subsection (a) applies, Subsection (d) does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.141" offset="10793892">In short, there are a number of cases in which Subsection (a) applies and (d) does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.712" offset="10816149">And, so in interpreting Subsection (d) to apply in the case of an unloaded gun does not render Subsection (a) superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.484" offset="10855332">In that connection, it is worth noting that a number of state courts and state legislatures have construed their first degree robbery statutes to cover the use of unloaded guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.291" offset="10902457">That has not rendered their second degree robbery statutes superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.095" offset="10921683">The fact that the state courts have unanimously construed the phrase "dangerous weapon", or nearly unanimously... there was one case that went the other way... supports our contention that such an interpretation comports with the plain meaning of the phrase, and, as I mentioned before, even in the absence of the strong legislative history in this case, we would so contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.978" offset="11013216">Petitioner has suggested in his reply brief that the eight state cases we have cited are not relevant because the evidence in those cases showed that the gun was used as a bludgeon or because a state statute in effect defined an unloaded gun as a dangerous weapon or because there was evidence that the gun might have been loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.410" offset="11111019">In one of the cases we cited, the Nichols case from Iowa, the court did, in fact, rely on a definitional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.516" offset="11143411">In two of the cases, the Aranda case from California and the Montano case from New Mexico, there was some evidence showing that the gun may have been loaded, but we cited those cases because the courts in those cases made absolutely clear that whether or not the gun was loaded made no difference in their holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.595" offset="11223763">In the other five cases, there was no evidence that the gun was used as a bludgeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.463" offset="11243198">There was no reliance upon any definitional statute and there was no evidence even attempting to show that the gun was unloaded, and the courts nevertheless held that the unloaded gun was a dangerous weapon when used in a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.723" offset="11300250">The experience in the one state where a court held that an unloaded gun is not a dangerous weapon when used in a robbery is also instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.329" offset="11338702">The legislature in that state, Wisconsin, subsequently amended the state statute so that it now applies to</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.518" offset="11367437">"any article used or fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably believe that it is a dangerous weapon. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.755" offset="11392410">As we noted in our brief, 15 other states have statutes that on their face appear to apply in the case of an unloaded gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.044" offset="11429504">To be sure, Petitioner pointed out, those reflect legislative judgments, but we cite them to show that it is sensible to construe robbery statutes to punish robbers who brandish weapons more severely than robbers who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.073" offset="11497631">It appears that the vast majority of the states that have considered that question have, like Congress, come to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.910" offset="11528978">In summary, the United States contends that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon or device within the meaning of Section 2113(d) because its display is likely to provoke retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.236" offset="11586238">In addition, an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon or device because it can be used as a bludgeon to inflict harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.425" offset="11615078">The addition of the words 2113(d) makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.698" offset="11652172">If an Indiana six shooter is a dangerous weapon, then a real gun that is not loaded surely is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.102" offset="11677772">Our construction of Subsection (d) does not render Subsection (a) redundant any more than the many state statutes and cases holding that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon under a first degree robbery statute makes the second degree statutes superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.794" offset="11740570">And, as the overwhelming weight of authority in favor of our view shows this position makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.800" offset="11772544">It makes sense to punish a robber who brandishes a weapon more severely than one who does not whether or not the robber's gun was loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.240" offset="11806294">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.327" offset="11834611">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.096" offset="11837745">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.380" offset="11850911">I agree that it makes sense to punish robbers who display guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.582" offset="11863659">That is why we have 924(c) which punishes robbers who display guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.384" offset="11878914">2113(d) punishes the use of a dangerous weapon during an assault committed during a bank robbery or used to place life in jeopardy during a bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.073" offset="11917680">This Court referred to the legislative history of 2113(d) in its footnote in Simpson and it explained that dangerous weapon applies equally to the assaultive and jeopardy clauses and it notes that 2113(d) was enacted to fight gangsterism in the 1930's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.637" offset="11991868">What was clearly in the mind of Congress was to punish people who use weapons that can shoot people, that can explode, and that weapons that look like them are not punished as devices but are punished under the fear section of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.730" offset="12056234">The Wisconsin experience is instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.848" offset="12068772">What should happen is that Congress should determine that 2113(d) encompasses unloaded handguns, not the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.971" offset="12105239">What the Fourth Circuit has done is foreclose the question entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.025" offset="12121435">There is a factual question to be decided during trials and it should be decided there during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.696" offset="12148080">What the government would have this Court do is cut dangerousness from this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.214" offset="12166157">Thank you very much.</text>
