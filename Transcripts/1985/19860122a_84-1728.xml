            <label>Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl</label>
            <text syncTime="66.848" offset="403254">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.269" offset="412867">The issue in this case is whether a Government employee union can require a Government agency to bargain over, and therefore to make a subject of grievance arbitration, a proposal that would give the union the right to enforce the provisions of Circular A-76.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.856" offset="487264">The court below held that a Government employee union can enforce the circular, but this result is anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.352" offset="521223">A-76 is a management directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.758" offset="530836">It flows from the authority of the President to manage the budget and to manage the Executive Branch, and it implements the President's economic policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.004" offset="571796">The circular itself expressly reserves to the President and to his delegates the authority to enforce the circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.656" offset="598441">But the decision below turned enforcement of the A-76 directive and of the President's management authority, and in turn the interpretation of the directive, over to arbitrators, with review perhaps only by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, perhaps no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.476" offset="681720">This result is not only contrary to the express language of the circular, but it also interferes with the authority of the President to give directives to his subordinates and to enforce those directives in his own way.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.925" offset="735532">It should not be assumed that Congress would have intended this anomalous result and this disruptive result, absent some clear statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.295" offset="777014">But on the contrary, the statute in fact requires no such solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.715" offset="794673">Let me try to condense here very quickly the statutory provisions that are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.367" offset="833230">All the parties agree that Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act gives management the right to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and all parties also agree that the only constraint on that management right is that it be... that is, the only constraint that's at issue in this case... is that the right to contract out be exercised "in accordance with applicable laws".</text>
            <text syncTime="200.810" offset="939078">So that the question for decision is whether the phrase A-76.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.758" offset="986830">The first and most important reason why the A-76 is not a law at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.081" offset="1040120">Well, Ms. Kuhl, suppose that we agreed that the circular is not a law for purposes of Section 7106.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.779" offset="1082961">Does that end the case, or do we still have to determine whether non-compliance with the circular is the subject of a grievance under the Act notwithstanding whether it's included in a collective bargaining agreement?</text>

            <text syncTime="322.339" offset="1425165">It doesn't say "laws".</text>
            <text syncTime="324.073" offset="1432061">It says</text>

            <text syncTime="327.321" offset="1445122">And we also have some rather specific legislative history there that indicates that Congress was concerned that unions not be able to create rules that would conflict with Government-wide policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.141" offset="1984394">The only challenge to agency action that the circular permits is by a very expedited appeals procedure that the circular creates within the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.667" offset="2038520">And it's important that this procedure is a very rapid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.589" offset="2054193">People who would like to challenge the agency's decision to contract out must file their appeal within 15 days, and the agency within itself must decide within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.925" offset="2103512">And again, there's no further right to review beyond that appeal within the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.846" offset="2123156">Every court and administrative body other than the court below that has been asked to enforce circular A-76 has respected the limitations that are contained within the language of the circular itself and has refused to create third party enforcement rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.276" offset="2196926">Two Courts of Appeal have turned down challenges brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Ninth Circuit has ruled in direct conflict with the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.912" offset="2239454">And perhaps most importantly, the Merit System Protection Board, which is the Congress agency which has authority to enforce employee rights in a non-union context, the MSTB has held that an employee's challenge to a reduction in force brought on the theory that the reduction in force was required by an incorrect decision to contract out, that that kind of challenge would not be brought predicated on A-76.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.384" offset="2369334">Thus, is seeking the right to enforce A-76, the union is seeking a right that non-union employees indisputably do not have, and it's our view that Congress did not anywhere express any intent to create this kind of disparity.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.903" offset="3251437">And actually, I draw the conclusion from that that the Authority doesn't fully believe what is says.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.478" offset="3285710">They say that the management rights clause does not apply to the grievance proceedings, but yet they say, well, when arbitrators get into a discretionary area they'll stay their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.661" offset="3330432">But they don't propose... the Authority does not propose any standards by which arbitrators are to decide when to stay their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.955" offset="3363659">And moreover, if the arbitrators do not stay their hands in the discretionary area, there can indeed be review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.153" offset="3404410">But as I've stated, it is questionable whether... it's an open question as to whether there can be any judicial review beyond that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.139" offset="3552368">That's correct, and we have yet another variation on the first theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.058" offset="3572012">If A-75 is a law... and of course we don't concede that it is a law... but if it is a law, we say that it is not an applicable law within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.459" offset="3629690">And the reason that we say that is because we read the "in accordance with applicable laws" language to give unions the right only to enforce laws that have rights personal, directly personal, to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.484" offset="3693743">If you read the phrase "in accordance with applicable law" more broadly than that, you run into some quite anomalous results, and Respondents do not explain why this result could have been intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.257" offset="3768871">They wouldn't draw any lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.538" offset="3773991">They would say "in accordance with applicable law" means that so long as the agency's action is constrained by some law somewhere, and so long as the agency's action has some effect on employees somehow, then there can be review or the unions can enforce that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.594" offset="3850164">But to just give a hypothetical of why that reads "in accordance with applicable laws" much too broadly, suppose Congress instructs the Forest Service to give priority to fire prevention, and suppose that the Forest Service then decides that it should conduct a reduction in force and some Forest Service personnel are included in that reduction in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.675" offset="3958520">The Authority's construction, the Respondent's construction, would seem to allow the union to come in and argue that the reduction in force was not in accordance with applicable law because Congress had indicated that fire prevention was a priority.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.350" offset="4093207">So that their construction really leads to the conclusion or would suggest that Congress intended to create very broad private rights of action for union employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.203" offset="4156632">But this Court has held that private rights of action should be inferred only when Congress has intended to create such remedies, and there is no indication of a Congressional intent here to create such broad rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.869" offset="4215251">To give the unions this kind of broad right of action would create a great disparity, as I've suggested before, between union and non-union employees in terms of the type of statutes that they can seek to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.613" offset="4270317">And as I say, there's no evidence Congress intended this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.987" offset="4283796">What we can glean from the legislative history is that Congress intended to take traditional personnel decisions that either union on non-union employees could bring under the old executive order regime and to give unions the ability to take these kinds of rights and raise them through the grievance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.228" offset="4364776">The broad interpretation that the Respondents would give to the 7106 subsection (a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.753" offset="4438859">To look at the structure of the statute, subsection (a)(1) management rights, which are the right of the agency to control the mission and the budget and the number of employees of the agency, is not constrained by the "in accordance with applicable law" phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.542" offset="4505942">In other words, the agency insofar as the union is concerned does not have to act in accordance with applicable laws in setting the mission of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.288" offset="4540946">But the Respondent's interpretation of (a)(2) that would reach just the same result that's precluded under subsection (a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.610" offset="4602281">This is rather difficult, but let me try and give a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.485" offset="4617746">Under subsection (a)(2), under the Respondent's theory, the union can require that layoffs comply with applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.777" offset="4658915">But under their reading they might be able, for example, to argue that the Forest Service was not complying with Congress' fire prevention priorities when it laid off people in the fire prevention area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.442" offset="4721609">But in fact, this kind of challenge would be exactly the sort of challenge that (a)(1) does not permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.222" offset="4748672">It would be a challenge to the mission of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.360" offset="4765285">So that while the Respondents try to suggest that they have a coherent interpretation of the statute as a whole, in fact their interpretation does conflict one part of a statute with another, and it also tries to read out certain parts of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.991" offset="4859744">For example, it does not give any effect to the language saying</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.253" offset="4884822">"nothing in this chapter shall effect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.378" offset="4897361">It reads that right out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.158" offset="4908436">To go back again to mission, particularly with regard to A-76 and the consequences that will flow if arbitral review of A-76 decisions is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.365" offset="5013240">These decisions, if permitted... that is, if arbitral review is allowed... will inevitably interfere with management's authority to contract out, because every aspect of circular A-76 involves matters of agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.327" offset="5089099">One of the chief reasons why courts have declined under the APA to review compliance with A-76 is that it lacks meaningful standards by which to judge an agency's exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.852" offset="5143225">And to give just one example of the kind of discretionary judgments that are involved in an agency's carrying out circular A-76, when the cost comparison is done by the agency it is premised on a management study that the agency has to conduct to determine the most efficient composition by which the agency could perform the function, so that already you have an element of estimation, an element of exercise of agency judgment, in just determining what the in-house cost comparison is to be based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.915" offset="5311454">The circular then goes on to say that, in determining personnel costs, one makes a staffing estimate that also is cabined by the tools, judgmental tools, that the agency is to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.952" offset="5403614">And as I've mentioned before, even the Authority admits that this kind of arbitral review for compliance with A-76 will at least sometimes impinge on agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.697" offset="5454605">But again, the solution that they offer is a clearly inadequate one of just the hope that arbitrators will stay their hands when they get into somehow the fine discretionary area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.425" offset="5505491">If the Court has no further questions, at this time I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.295" offset="5553034">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Courts:</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.045" offset="5564005">One of the responsibilities entrusted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority by Congress is the task of determining the negotiability of collective bargaining proposals in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.244" offset="5608832">This case arose nearly six years ago now when AFGE submitted a proposal which provided that Petitioner EEOC agree to comply with OMB circular A-76 and other applicable laws and regulations concerning contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.376" offset="5673302">The Authority found the proposal to be negotiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.312" offset="5689080">Underlying the Authority's determination are three basic propositions to which the Authority has adhered since the first days of its enabling statute, the first proposition here being that the statute does indeed reserve to management as non-negotiable the substantive exercise in accordance with applicable laws of the management rights enumerated in Section 7105(a)(2); however, a proposal such as the one here that imposes no substantive limitations of its own making, that simple restates management's obligation to comply with applicable legal requirements when exercising those reserved rights, is negotiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.485" offset="5845710">The second proposition here being that the statute in the federal sector defines the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.825" offset="5879147">Thus, even in the absence of a proposal such as the one here, with or without such a proposal, disputes about the applications of laws, rules, and regulations such as the circular, affecting conditions of employment, are within the scope of the grievance procedure unless the parties agree through negotiations to exclude such grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.458" offset="5965664">The final proposition here is likewise rooted in the notion that the statute prescribes the scope and the coverage of a negotiated grievance procedure in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.890" offset="6011326">Thus, no Government-wide rule or regulation, including the circular, even a rule or regulation purporting to address the permissible scope in some fashion of the grievance procedure, may be applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the scope as defined by this Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.116" offset="6084260">Having stated these propositions, I would also like to note, because I think it is pertinent to an understanding of this case, one proposition in which the Authority's decision takes absolutely no root, and that is this Authority decision and no Authority decision of which I am aware either is based upon or provides any support for the notion that in the area of management's reserved rights choices of policy or matters of discretion that management reserves to itself are somehow susceptible to the bargaining process or to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.275" offset="6224903">An examination of the first proposition, that proposals such as the one here are negotiable, demonstrates the faithfulness of the Authority in this decision to the text of the statute and to its own decisional precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.316" offset="6277044">The statute does reserve to management in Section 7106(a)(2), along with other rights, the non-negotiable substantive authority to make determinations with respect to contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.279" offset="6328975">The Authority in its decisional precedent has recognized, respected, and effectuated that reservation of authority to management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.573" offset="6362098">But this authority reserved to management is not unfettered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.024" offset="6379862">By the literal terms of the statute, that authority is subject, first of all, to the negotiation of procedures under Section 7106(b)(2) and appropriate arrangements under Section 7106(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.910" offset="6435450">Furthermore, the statute expressly provides that management's contracting out authority, as well as the other enumerated reserved rights, must be exercised in accordance with applicable laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.403" offset="6485396">Thus, a bargaining proposal like this one is not rendered non-negotiable simply because it mentions a reserved right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.120" offset="6516325">Indeed, in a long line of decisional precedent, the Authority has consistently found to be negotiable proposals like the one in this case, proposals that impose no substantive criteria of their own making, but instead simply restate management's obligation to act in accordance with applicable laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2801.556" offset="11342082">--It certainly is not a burden that is outside the contemplation of Congress, if it is a burden at all, because Congress made such matters subject to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.176" offset="11380534">And Petitioner and other employing agencies do have one avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.830" offset="11407179">The exceptions to the grievance procedure as defined by statute are either the five subjects enumerated in the statute... there are five subject areas... or they are matters that the pretties themselves agree to exclude from the grievance procedure through negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.932" offset="11475516">So therefore, Petitioner can propose during collective bargaining negotiations that contracting out matters or any other matters that it does not want to have subject to the grievance procedure be excluded from the broad scope of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.598" offset="11538209">But absent such, absent such negotiations and agreement between the parties, the statutory definition is quite explicit and quite express in its breadth and in terms of what it covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.936" offset="11595574">Despite the fact that contracting out is not one of the five subjects expressly excluded by Congress, the Petitioner has contended throughout this litigation that matters concerning contracting out are not grievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.100" offset="11668195">In essence, Petitioner has argued that the statute's designation of a subject as a management right also operates to preclude the subject from the scope of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.628" offset="11706334">But Petitioner acknowledges to this Court that grievances over discipline and promotions are permissible, ever though discipline and promotions are reserved management rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.576" offset="11750115">But Petitioner's reliance on the phrase in Section 7106</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.121" offset="11772267">"nothing in this chapter shall affect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.699" offset="11778641">as having that effect of removing it from the grievance procedure is unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.556" offset="11798076">First of all, if they were correct about that language it would mean that even discipline and promotions were not grievable, and they have acknowledged that those subjects are grievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.818" offset="11839036">Furthermore, relying on that phrase in isolation just doesn't take into account the "in accordance with applicable laws" language or the fact that the statute expressly says that it is subject to procedures and appropriate arrangements bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.827" offset="11891072">And of course, the legislative history certainly indicates that that section of the statute is meant only to prohibit bargaining in certain respects and it does not treat the grievability of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.620" offset="11942272">Petitioner now also makes the argument to this Court that, even if it were somehow coming within the grievance procedure, it nevertheless should be excluded because contracting out determinations bear only indirectly on the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.005" offset="12007787">But of course there are any number of indications of the direct effect of contracting out matters on the bargaining unit employees, and that contracting out affects or is a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.936" offset="12051568">Among these indications are the very terms of the circular, which since 1979 has recognized the stake that employees and their bargaining representatives have in contracting out by providing them access to the circular's appeals procedure for challenging cost comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.055" offset="12116038">The circular, I would note, describes its appeals procedure as a mechanism</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.897" offset="12135369">"intended to protect the rights of all directly affected parties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.614" offset="12150311">Moreover, the circular provides that employees should be informed about the undertaking and the progress of cost studies, and agency regulations, which also involve grievable matters to the extent that they impose mandatory criteria, agency regulation such as the Air Force and Army regulations referenced in AFGE's bried have specific provisions about employee and union involvement in aspects of the cost study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.385" offset="12253338">And the circular itself also addresses arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the conversion to contract performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.710" offset="12290641">And as I have noted before, the Office of Management and Budget extended national consultation rights over the circular to federal sector unions, and those are extended with regard to laws, rules, or regulations... excuse me, Government-wide regulations affecting any substantive change in any condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.437" offset="12361589">And furthermore, the notion that Congress intended to exclude contracting out matters from the scope of the grievance procedure doesn't find any support in the legislative history or the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.120" offset="12408296">And to the extent that private sector precedent provides an appropriate analogy for our program, that law strongly supports the status of contracting out as a condition of employment and of its susceptibility to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.520" offset="12461899">But this does not mean, of course, to say that anything, no matter how attenuated its relationship or effects on employment, would be subject to the grievance procedure, but that matters such as this are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.796" offset="12518951">Disputes involving contracting out determinations, to the extent that they affect... excuse me.</text>
