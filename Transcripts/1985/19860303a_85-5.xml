            <label>Mr. Jay C. Waldman</label>
            <text syncTime="88.512" offset="495000">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="91.557" offset="507121">This litigation involves an award by the District Court of substantial legal fee enhancements by use of so-called multipliers for three phases of legal work during controversies over implementation of consent decree, calling for the institution of an automobile emission inspection program in Pennsylvania under the Federal Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.689" offset="599699">The effect was to increase these legal fees by up to 200 percent for inexperienced attorneys already receiving a high hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.793" offset="652153">The result were hourly rates for attorneys of up to $400, or compensation for the equivalent of 1,700 hours of legal work that was in fact never done.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="709727">The explanation consisted of three conclusory paragraphs in a 45 page opinion, that the quality of representation was high in one phase, that the issues were novel and difficult in two phases, and that in all three phases, the Respondent was found to have had a low likelihood of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.636" offset="807529">This was despite the heavy burden of proof that Petitioner bore in all phases under the controlling law of the circuit, and this was after the Court disallowed 806 hours requested, including time for attendance at press conferences and interviews as unnecessary, duplicative, inadequately documented, and of dubious significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.938" offset="904705">The Court also awarded legal fees for submitting comments on draft administrative regulations and attending an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.107" offset="937410">We contend that the latter violates Section 304(d) of the Clean Air Act which clearly specifies there shall be compensation for work done only in litigation, and we find that the former violates reason, it is irrational; it violates the intent of Congress in the fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.271" offset="1026018">We find... excuse me... we contend that it is violative of the underpinnings of this honorable Court's holdings in Blum v. Stenson, and indeed, we ask the Court to decide today the issue it left open in Footnote 17 of Blum as to whether these use of so-called multipliers in cases based on a finding that the prevailing party was in fact unlikely to prevail and ran a high risk of not succeeding are ever appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.865" offset="1176378">We contend they are irrational because they penalize defendants with the best defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.644" offset="1199471">They reward plaintiffs with the most marginal claims, and therefore have to encourage the flooding of the court with those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.327" offset="1238236">They are particularly inappropriate where the losing party bore the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.997" offset="1256940">They result in irrational and anomalous kinds of findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.713" offset="1283794">We force a court to decide that it was likely, in retrospect, that it would have decided a case differently than it in fact did, and one must ask oneself, if one wishes to be rational, how unlikely must a court find it was to have reached the result it did before one must question whether that result was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.592" offset="1387343">It forces the attorney for the losing party, in order to protect his client from the risk of substantial additional fees, to argue after the litigation that in fact he never had a very good defense, that there was no serious likelihood that the prevailing party would fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.193" offset="1477727">There are absolutely no standards; these multipliers are awarded randomly, and often the court will pick a number out of the air that it deems appropriate, that will multiply the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.883" offset="1612519">Mr. Waldman, the District Court allowed, as I understand it, two sorts of multipliers or increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.425" offset="1658599">One was a so-called quality of representation multiplier or increase, and although the Court acted before our opinion in Blum v. Stenson, it did appear to set forth as its reasons some of the reasons spelled out in Blum v. Stenson that might justify such an increase, did it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="404.103" offset="1757342">I would have to say no, it did not, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.819" offset="1772179">In fact, the entire explanation that the Court gives under the heading of multiplier, which begins on page 38a of the Appendix, consists of three conclusory paragraphs in which it simply states as a conclusion that they find that in fact there was a high quality of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.720" offset="1835813">But I think of greater importance is the Court's holding in Blum that absent rare circumstances, quality of representation and result achieved, and in virtually all cases novelty, complexity and difficulty of the issues also cited by the District Court, are subsumed in the normal calculation of reasonable hours expended, multiplied--</text>

            <text syncTime="446.350" offset="1926302">Well, what should the Court have said in terms of any incantations before its quality of representation multiplier should be allowed?</text>

            <text syncTime="459.081" offset="1977293">I would say that before you can allow a quality multiplier, based on this Court's holding, the burden is on the fee applicant to prove in evidence in the record that the Court can cite to that it meets the test of this Court for the so-called rare and exceptional test, and I read that as a two-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.462" offset="2058795">One, they have to prove that the quality of the representation is not adequately reflected in the calculation this Court held is presumptively reasonable, reasonable hours times a reasonable hourly fee, and B, that their success was exceptional, not excellent, exceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.251" offset="2137893">And there was absolutely no evidence in the record and no evidence cited by the Court for either of those tests.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.435" offset="2490651">It's in their Code of Professional Responsibility... when the &lt;ABA&gt; [= ABA] said you may consider contingency, I really submit to you that they never contemplated by that that a lawyer, after he totalled up his fee based on reasonable hours, should then multiply it by a number picked out of the air and send a bill for that amount to his client.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.122" offset="2637459">It is in my opinion, Justice Stevens, because unlike the hypothetical that you give where a private party is free to enter into any agreement with a private attorney to file the riskiest, most dubious litigation, we are here dealing with cases where Congress only intended that meritorious cases be brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.767" offset="3067957">Yes, and I believe it's precisely, Justice Stevens, what Congress did not intend, and I think this Court recognized that in Hensley, among other cases, in the fee shifting statute because it specified for compensation only for successful claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.901" offset="3140578">In fact, this honorable Court has gone so far as to say it, that the District Courts must scrutinize records to make certain that they are not compensating an attorney for work done on unsuccessful portions of a case or unsuccessful claims in the same litigation, let alone help subsidize him for losing work done in unrelated cases, for unrelated parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.970" offset="3220826">Mr. Waldman, do you think that in determining the prevailing market rate, that there is a different rate generally in the community for... that lawyers for plaintiffs charge when there are these uncertainty factors, and the rate charged by the typical defense bar, and does the Court maybe look to a specialized market within the plaintiffs' bar for determining the prevailing market rate?</text>
            <text syncTime="802.020" offset="3349035">In a case involving damages as well as equitable relief, I would say quite possibly yes, Justice O'Connor, but think about what's really happening here.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.327" offset="3390204">What's happening here is we are compensating these lawyers as if they were getting a fixed fee, fixed hourly fee typical of the defense bar, plus a contingency or percentage typical of the plaintiffs' bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.275" offset="3454047">We are giving them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.228" offset="3457809">First, we multiplying the reasonable hours times a reasonable hourly rate, and on top of that, we are picking a number out of the air and multiplying that, resulting in still a greater amount of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.237" offset="4293936">I have not practiced in Philadelphia, but I assume that's standard in any major city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.797" offset="4316088">The government's position is, in this case, that contingency multipliers, multipliers employed for the risk of failing to win a case, should never play a part in setting a reasonable attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.462" offset="4382752">There are two reasons for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.804" offset="4392156">The first is we think such multipliers are inconsistent with the intent of Congress, and the second is that the reason that they are applied is so irrational that we cannot believe that Congress intended courts to be employing this sort of system in setting what is supposedly a reasonable attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.408" offset="4462582">To look at the intent of Congress and how contingency multiplier subvert that intent, the Court need only consider two hypothetical cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.184" offset="4501662">In case A, the plaintiff loses his case, and we know that he is entitled to no fee Whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.182" offset="4529665">He did not prevail, and there is no fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.634" offset="4539487">In case B, the plaintiff wins, and we know equally clearly that he is entitled to a fully compensatory fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.601" offset="4567386">But once the Court starts adding contingency multipliers to case B, the successful case, to compensate that plaintiff's lawyer for the fact that he lost case A, the Court is doing exactly what Congress and this Court has said is impermissible, compensating for losing cases or losing claims in totally unrelated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.729" offset="4667905">It is worse even than what the Court condemned in Hensley.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.259" offset="5317936">Our position, just to sum up on that point, is that if Congress wanted to adopt a system of paying for every case, whether successful or not, then it should legislative such a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.079" offset="5385227">That is essentially what the Court held in Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.656" offset="5395572">Congress has not enacted such a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.858" offset="5408320">In fact, it's made a point of doing the contrary, and until Congress makes the change for courts to compensate losing parties by cross-subs, by taking extra money in winning cases and cross-subsidizing losing cases, is contrary to congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.305" offset="5474148">We also think that just as the burden of proving the reasonable number of hours, the reasonable hourly rate falls on the fee applicant under this Court's cases, so, too, the burden of proving the need for a contingency adjustment should fall on the fee applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.361" offset="5538409">The fee applicant should be required to show that absent the contingency adjustment there would not be sufficient competent counsel to take the types of cases that Congress meant to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.701" offset="5579787">The Court need only scan through the pages of the Federal Reporters to know that that is in fact not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.963" offset="5608836">There is no empirical evidence whatsoever, and in fact, the evidence is to the contrary, that the current system of compensation without multipliers is fully adequate to attract competent counsel to take the cases that Congress intended to encourage when it enacted fee shifting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.816" offset="5672156">As I mentioned a moment ago, the other rationale for contingency adjustments is delay in payment rather than uncertainty about being paid at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.546" offset="5711131">For the United States, that rationale is as inconsistent with sovereign immunity as the argument that you heard last week in Library of Congress v. Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.558" offset="5751151">It is simply a disguised interest payment, and it violates sovereign immunity without express congressional authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.774" offset="5779990">We also agree strongly with the Commonwealth that contingency multipliers, as currently applied, are so irrational that Congress could not have intended them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.300" offset="5826174">Hensley in the lodestar approach have, as the Court noted in the Hensley opinion, the virtue of objectivity, but once the Court starts plucking numbers out of the air, having made what is supposedly a mathematically precise calculation of a reasonable attorney's fee, then says now I am going to double it, I am going to multiply it by 1.5, by 3.5, by whatever number strikes the Court in a clearly subjective sense as the multiplier, we have lost all sense of computing an objectively reasonable attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.616" offset="5955428">The doubling, the tripling, whatever the Court does with these multipliers makes it impossible for the Court to justify to a reviewing Court why it has picked the number it has picked, makes it impossible for the defendants who are saddled with this extra fee liability to meaningfully challenge it because they have no idea where the number came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.809" offset="6048215">It also produces counterintuitive results about what kinds of litigation Congress meant to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.041" offset="6073084">As my colleague pointed out, plaintiffs with the weakest cases have the strongest incentive to pursue those cases because the Court is likely to give them the highest multiplier because their chances of success were least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.068" offset="6121253">That is clearly not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.488" offset="6130867">Finally, in response to Justice O'Connor's questions at the beginning of my colleague's argument about what kind of incantation a court would have to engage in, here in this case our position is there is no... it's not that the words weren't there, it's that on the facts of this case there simply is no incantation that would have justified the multiplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.369" offset="6230445">The quality multipliers, I am moving now from contingency to quality multipliers, were, although in one sentence the Court said the work was superior, the reason the Court said the work was superior was because, it said, the issues ware novel and complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.049" offset="6293139">Those factors we know from Blum are subsumed or are supposed to be subsumed in the lodestar fee, and therefore, it's not a question of missing words in this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.592" offset="6335353">It's a question of the Court counting on the novelty and complexity, merging superior quality and novelty and complexity, and it's true that this litigation was quite protracted, post-consent decree, but what that did was force or enable, however you want to view it, the plaintiffs, respondents, to spend more hours on the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.692" offset="6435663">Those hours that the District Court found were reasonably expended were then compensated at a fair hourly rate, respondents have not challenged that in this Court, and they have dropped any challenge to whether that was a reasonable hourly rate or a reasonable number of hours, and therefore our quarrel isn't really with the explanation given but rather with the fact that no permissible explanation could have been given on the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.666" offset="6539631">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Douglas Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="1606.475" offset="6566798">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.303" offset="6578187">I had suspected that this argument might involved a great deal of the facts of this case, and in that sense the case is really not certworthy because you have a District Court required to deal with factors that were going to be announced by This Court long after the decision was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.390" offset="6658540">The argument plainly has not turned that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.029" offset="6669093">The argument has turned on the question left open in Blum, and I would address that primarily here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.057" offset="6693126">The question which is posed is should a contingency adjustment ever be appropriate in any case on the fee shifting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.739" offset="6743908">It seems to me there are six reasons why it is obvious that in some way, whether in an adjustment of the lodestar or in a multiplier, because the lodestar has not been adjusted, contingency must be awarded, must be a factor in the determination of a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.638" offset="6815484">The first answer, of course, is the intention of Congress, and Congress, when it did its most comprehensive study of the fee shifting statutes, in dealing with Section 1988, went to some District Court cases and one leading Court of Appeals case in the Fifth Circuit and said this is the kind of factor we are looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.788" offset="6892075">They took Johnson in the Fifth Circuit, and Johnson, of course, turned back to the ABA standards, and one of the factors that they said was used in determining what is a reasonable attorney's fee was the contingent nature of the case, whether the fee is fixed or contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.937" offset="6952679">Three District Court cases were cited, and at least in one of them, Stanford Daily v. Zurcher, there was a plain award of a multiplier because of contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.481" offset="6986847">It's a three factor problem there, but contingency is plainly part of what the Court cited there, and at least in one of the other three cases there is some indication that contingency was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.570" offset="7035226">So Congress plainly was thinking of adjustment, by the way, adjustments up and down, as this Court has said, but an adjustment for contingency was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.034" offset="7069080">Second point you would turn to is, of course, history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.236" offset="7081933">I meant to take a little time this morning to go see what Justice Sharswood's lecture said back in the middle of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.593" offset="7111294">Absent those and the Alabama rules of 1887, I can go no earlier than 1908, but I presume that most of the members of Congress who adopted the fee shifting statute had probably, those who were lawyers, begun their practice after 1908 and were operating on the basis of the then canons of professional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.522" offset="7191020">And Canon XII plainly lists among the factors that can be taken into account in setting a reasonable attorney's fee, an ethical attorney's fee, the contingent nature of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.331" offset="8330272">Anyhow, the history plainly says that contingency is one of the things you figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.719" offset="8351797">Contrary to what is suggested, as I read the brief in Blum v. Stenson... and I didn't bring it along... the government cited that District of Columbia language that you don't expect to get counsel to take a fee where there's a danger he won't be paid at the same rate he would take a case when he was sure of being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.851" offset="8440300">I thought it was cited as a statement of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.569" offset="8455242">That's how I read it in Blum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.301" offset="8462138">What I certainly read and I do have present in the Court, the courtroom, the brief in Shaw, argued a week ago today, in which in Footnote 8 the government ends by saving moreover, for a beginning practitioner or small firm attorney identified by Respondent as the typical civil rights lawyer... we're not so sure that's true... factors wholly independent of the no interest rule such as the contingent nature of the fees awarded under Title VII and the likelihood that the lawyer will have no steady stream of income will have more effect than the delay of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.116" offset="8605394">So the government, when they wrote their brief in Shaw, knew that contingency mattered, and I suggest an interest is plainly... delay in payment is plainly a part of the contingency question, and I saw in the courtroom a week ago and I listened to Mr. Rothfeld tell the Court in answer to a question that if you weren't dealing with the government, normally the way you would build a fee would be to include as one of the factors in that fee the delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.730" offset="8711869">So the Solicitor General as recently as a week ago still believed that that part of contingency, the difference between whether you get paid when you do the work, or whether you get paid years later, made a difference.</text>

Hillary, just January of this year, or in Patsy v. Florida Board several years back is the standard you measure it by, you have to say that the fact that Congress has been aware of the fact that contingency is a factor in setting fees, and Congress has refused to change it, even in the face of 13 circuits which have applied those multipliers, then that is an indication that Congress approves the multiplier, that nobody has been doing anything wrong in allowing the contingency multiplier to exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.340" offset="11510315">Well, I think it has to do with who we are fighting and the kind of fight we had, or my clients had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.369" offset="11530377">The kind of enemy we have, maybe, or the kind of opponent we have maybe is best illustrated in the briefs in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.913" offset="11560574">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania four times came to the Supreme Court of the United States, to this Court, they said, this is a case so important and so wrong that you ought to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.391" offset="11610520">In one case, it's so bad that you ought to stay the operation of the Third Circuit's order because that cert is plainly going to be granted, and there's a great likelihood that there will be reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.059" offset="11661198">We were told at that point that these issues were so important that this court must deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.119" offset="11681365">We had to fight all of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.539" offset="11691082">And then when they get to this Court and the Court finally accepts certiorari to deal with the question left open in Blum v. Stenson, they say we could never have won this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.909" offset="11740610">This isn't a case that you had any problems with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.720" offset="11755866">That's the opponent we have fought in this, and that is the opponent against whom this multiplier, which comes to something under a nickel apiece for the 6 million people in Pennsylvania who didn't have clean air for five years because of this resistance to a consent decree, that's what it comes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.994" offset="11832875">The last point I would like to make in this case... and I think I will rely entirely on my brief on the question of the importance of the administrative proceedings except to say that common sense days you don't have regulations required under a consent decree, tell counsel don't bother to go as over to the hearings on the regulations that are going to be adopted, you wait until the wrong regulations are adopted, then you can litigate them in court, and with a lot more time you can get paid for your work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.356" offset="11966413">I think it is perfectly obvious that common sense says that you go to the... when you have won a decree that says create regulations, you go to the place where the regulations are being made and make them part of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.976" offset="12016881">But I will go on past that and talk about what seems to me to be the final question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.301" offset="12046138">The one thing that all three of the judges in the court below were clearly in agreement on was that you can't reverse this case out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.406" offset="12082605">You can't simply say because Judge Bechtle didn't foresee all of the points that were going to be developed in Blum v. Stenson, that anywhere he didn't touch base just right on the language we hold it against him, and the way he built the fee... and this is what you're doing you're building a fee, which is what a lawyer does or a judge acting for a lawyer in setting a reasonable attorney's fee here, the way you build a fee is you work--</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.536" offset="12207053">--I'll take computing a fee, but it makes it sound more mechanical than I believe the setting of a reasonable attorney's fee is, Justice Rehnquist, but to compute a fee, you are certainly working a whole series of factors against each other, and to suggest that you can take the multipliers out when Judge Bechtle computed his entire fee built on saying this kind of result that deserves a multiplier is based on work in the very limited number of hours I allowed, or my decision on the rates is based on the fact that I have... I can... I picked noncontingent rates because I can multiply them contingency later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.328" offset="12394298">Judge Becker, who dissented in the Court below, said what you've got to do is you've got to send it down to Judge Bechtle and let him look into the question of whether he's built contingency into the rates, whether the rates are reasonable under Blum v. Stenson was in his reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.898" offset="12468486">The majority of the Court said, and I think this is absolutely correct, Judge Bechtle had the foresight to anticipate where this Court was going in Blum, he cited the right factors, his discussion is not three paragraphs; his discussion is a 40 some page opinion, and the paragraphs bring together the issues that were discussed in that 40 some page decision and say here's why I have the multipliers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.310" offset="12566184">It seems to me that at the very least, if this Court does not affirm or conclude that apart from the contingency matter, this case really doesn't belong before the Court at all, that at the very least the matter should go back to the Third Circuit and from them to Judge Bechtle to say all right, here are all the rules you operate with, build or compute a fee that will fairly compensate so that you will continue to get able lawyers in the bar doing what they should do because, contrary to what Ms. Oberly says, we've had enough people doing these cases because in thirteen circuits, over many years, there was the possibility among other things of multipliers for excellence or for contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.761" offset="12751967">That should be continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.273" offset="12777985">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.772" offset="12796062">First of all, in this case this particular party's lawyer received an average of $210 an hour for all the legal work done in all phases, even the ones where no multiplier was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.671" offset="12859591">I submit this is more than adequate to attract competent counsel in the future to represent comparable parties with comparable claims, and particularly under a scheme where Congress intended only meritorious cases be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.682" offset="12915702">Another point that I would make is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.694" offset="12943706">--I would say that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had very good arguments on the facts, but what made the case very, very difficult was in fact that we bore a heavy burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.234" offset="13021864">Well, we didn't, but the Commonwealth did, and a new administration taking a new view for three years attempted to amend it, not resist it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.307" offset="13058122">But in any event, we bore a strong burden of proof in all phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.977" offset="13076826">We had the award here of a multiplier of four, one of the highest multipliers ever used, for an attorney a year out of law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.505" offset="13110994">And were not paying an engineering fee, we were paying a legal fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.989" offset="13128862">Also, I think very importantly, my opponent confuses the contingent nature of litigation with a continent fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.203" offset="13161776">All the case that he refers to indicated was that where in fact there is a contingent fee agreement, a contract, the Court should look to that contract as a guideline for what fee it in fact allows, and under no circumstances should it exceed that fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.134" offset="13233456">But the courts have held where there is no contract for a fixed fee or a contingency, it awards reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.427" offset="13262609">And this honorable Court has held that a fee is presumptively reasonable under a fee shifting statute if it multiplies the reasonable number of hours expended times a reasonable hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.313" offset="13310151">In this case, Your Honors, we had a high hourly rate and a substantial number of hours, and I would submit that certainly the fee is reasonable and should, I would argue, be sufficient to compensate any lawyer in the future who was asked to undertake comparable kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.898" offset="13396565">I would make one last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.616" offset="13407431">Thirteen circuit courts may have ruled the way my opponent indicates, but in fact, only three circuit courts have even addressed this issue since Blum was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.769" offset="13440032">And two of them, the Seventh and the District of Columbia, do not agree with my opponent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.595" offset="13463333">In fact, they raise most of the objection we have raised here today to the use of contingency multipliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.357" offset="13486321">One went the other way, the First Circuit.</text>
