            <text syncTime="340.532" offset="1504900">The faculty had devoted considerable time to helping him along at the point which was reached in mid-summer 1980 when they warned him in writing... and that writing appears at 146 of the Joint Appendix... that one more deficiency would be cause for his being dropped from registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.696" offset="1589642">Now, that deficiency could have taken the form, if the Court please, of a failure in a course grade or a failure on a final exam, but in Mr. Ewing's case it took the form of a failure on the National Board of Medical Examiners, Part I Exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.407" offset="1656411">This is a two-day exam which tests students in seven subject matter areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.119" offset="1735300">That score was the lowest in the Inteflex program, the combined baccalaureate and medical school program in which Respondent was enrolled and occasioned concerned on the part of the faculty, Promotion and Review Board, which met the following month to review his record and determine his eligibility to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.417" offset="1832476">That meeting took place on July 24, 1981, and was the first of what was to be five meetings of the Michigan faculty devoted to reviewing Mr. Ewing's record.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.077" offset="1887124">There were two Promotion Board meetings and three meetings of the Medical School's Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.648" offset="1913456">If you add all of that up, you will find that over two dozen senior faculty members at the University of Michigan's Medical School devoted countless hours to reviewing Mr. Ewing's progress through the Medical School both before and after.</text>

For example, if Ewing were dismissed because, after taking this exam, he went to a clinical course where in fact he got an honors, but let's say he had done something in the judgment of the faculty his performance was so poor he should be dismissed for that, then there would be no violation of his property interest because he couldn't retake the exam because for some other reason he was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.511" offset="11476884">The significance here is the combination of the fact that the violation of the rule resulted in the deprivation of the property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.867" offset="11510321">He might have a contract claim under state law if it were important enough and not a trivial matter, but he wouldn't have a federal claim because what Michigan has defined as his property interest is his dismissal, not some right to take the exam.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.828" offset="11586180">Under the Booker case, cited by the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme Court has held there is a property right not to be arbitrarily dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.767" offset="11617841">Let me briefly address the Eleventh Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.219" offset="11627663">I think there are three answers to that argument that was first raised in the rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.338" offset="11648143">The first is that the suit against the Regents has always been considered by the Regents to be against the Regents in their official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.777" offset="11673952">That can be shown from the Joint Appendix where they argue that the money damage claim was barred under Edelman v. Jordan, but said to the District Court you can enter an injunctive relief against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.133" offset="11711359">That is somebody who thinks the suit is against the officials in their official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.120" offset="11731317">Secondly, we have filed, Justice O'Connor, a motion to amend under the teachings of Brandon v. Holt where an amendment was permitted even though no motion had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.642" offset="11769351">And, there is no prejudice shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.292" offset="11776038">There has been no objection filed by the Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.094" offset="11783248">And, under Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is appropriate to conform the evidence, to conform the pleadings to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.867" offset="11814282">Finally, under the Toll case in this Court, the Regents waived any claim that they now belatedly assert, because they told the District Court that they would be liable for injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.578" offset="11889096">As a matter of fact, it is a tactic that the Regents continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.280" offset="11899963">And, I refer Your Honor to the case of Spielberg v. Regents, cited in our brief, a 1985 decision where, according to the reported case... It is Spielberg v. Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.803" offset="11934027">It is Judge Feikens again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.086" offset="11939147">It is a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.588" offset="11945207">It is a full consideration and the Eleventh Amendment is not mentioned there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.185" offset="12959594">I think there are two good reasons, two good answers to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.505" offset="12980806">The first is that the medical faculty considers it very important that its students display the ability to perform in a timely way and to do the things they are assigned under pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.265" offset="13047888">Mr. Ewing did not demonstrate that ability, in fact, quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.168" offset="13067532">He was at the six-year mark when he had completed the work that most Inteflex students complete in four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.441" offset="13104626">But, the more significant and important answer to that question is that our medical faculty feels very keenly its obligation to the public to assure the public that the holder of a M.D. degree from Michigan is a qualified physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.986" offset="13174739">They had reached a careful and considered judgment that Mr. Ewing was not going to be a qualified physician and they felt a duty to dismiss him from registration without permitting him to go forward in the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.518" offset="13272855">The District Court's first opinion back in 1982 concluded by holding that the University was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and that there had been no waiver of that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.194" offset="13335549">And the subsequent opinion of the District Court addressed the substantive issue in the case without deciding it on Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.370" offset="13396257">Justice Powell, the motion was for dismissal of Count Three of the Complaint which sought monetary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.274" offset="13423947">The explanation is that the decision by Judge Feikens was filed before this Court's decision in Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.797" offset="13458011">Pennhurst changed all perception and the Court's perception, I think, of the scope of the Eleventh Amendment defense as it applied to claims for injunctive relief against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.092" offset="13527183">It has been clear for some time that claims for monetary relief were clearly barred, but claims for prospective injunctive relief have been in an even much less clear area, if I may say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.601" offset="13581204">Pennhurst changed that with respect to claims for injunctive relief against states to compel them to conform their conduct to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.874" offset="13618298">And, at the bottom of this case, it is our contention that that is what Plaintiff seeks, an injunction compelling the University of Michigan to conform its conduct to its rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.967" offset="13674723">As a constitutional corporation of the State of Michigan, rules created by the University may be regarded as state laws, I think, within the same scope as the state laws which were at issue in Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.409" offset="13744417">Therefore, if the case is seen as an effort by Respondent to compel the University to conform its conduct to this so-called rule, then I suggest that it fits within the rubric of Pennhurst and should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
