            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150257">We will hear arguments first this morning in Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, against Roy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.155" offset="166871">Mr. Geller, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="6.732" stopTime="162.139">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="6.732" offset="177111">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of two federal statutes that require applicants for welfare benefits to provide the government with their social security numbers as a condition on receiving those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.709" offset="253075">Appellees claim that it would violate their rights under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment if they had to provide the Social Security number of their daughter, Little Bird of the Snow.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.439" offset="299991">The District Court agreed with this claim and declare the statute unconstitutional and ordered the government to provide the welfare benefits without insisting that the appellees comply with the Social Security Number requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.996" offset="358192">We have taken a direct appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.088" offset="370521">Before turning to the facts of this case, I would like to mention very briefly an important aspect of the two federal programs that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.255" offset="407197">Both the aid to families with dependent children program and the food stamp program are obviously based on financial need, and the amount of the government grant is a function of family size and family income.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.296" offset="467384">As a result, all earned and unearned income of each family member has to be counted in determining eligibility and the amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.683" offset="508970">Therefore, under both programs, it is essential that benefit applicants furnish income and eligibility data for each member of the family, including children, and that we be able to verify that information for each member of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.661" offset="576889">Now, when appellee Stephen Roy applied for AFDC and food stamp benefits, he agreed to give the government his own Social Security Number and the Social Security Numbers of his wife and elder daughter, but he refused to give the Social Security Number of his younger daughter, Little Bird of the Snow.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.137" offset="654734">Roy claimed that as a result of his religious beliefs, he considers Social Security Numbers to be part of the so-called Great Evil, because the numbers are used by computers, and therefore rob people's spirits.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.491" offset="716174">Now, Roy testified that the evil of Social Security Numbers is related to their function as unique personal identifiers, and that if he had to obtain a Social Security Number for Little Bird of the Snow and provide it to the government, it would rob her spirit and deprive her of the ability to achieve greater power.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.139" offset="798721">Mr. Geller, the Court below found that the claim was based on a sincere religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.963" offset="834038">Your comments suggest that you think that that might not be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.883" offset="857757">Do you concede that it was the product of a sincere religious belief?</text>

            <text syncTime="186.815" offset="897464">We did challenge in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.799" offset="905405">We have not challenged in this Court that it is the product of a sincere religious belief, but I am sure it is sincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.749" offset="929228">We have some doubts whether it is the product of a religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.108" offset="942603">I think many people in our society have these sorts of concerns.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="226.049" stopTime="319.778">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="226.049" offset="1054407">I am sure as this Court is aware from reading the briefs, there are a number of peculiar aspects to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.032" offset="1082306">The most peculiar, I think, is that the case had been tried on the assumption that Little Bird of the Snow did not have a Social Security Number, and that it would violate Roy's First Amendment rights if he had to obtain one for her and provide it to the government, but it came out on the last day of trial that she in fact did have a Social Security Number because her mother had applied for one right after she was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.193" offset="1174988">I think it is fair to say that when this revelation was made Roy changed somewhat the nature of his constitutional objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.252" offset="1211246">This case had been brought on the theory and the complaint charged that Roy's First Amendment rights would be violated by having to obtain and provide a Social Security Number to the government in order to get welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.748" offset="1261193">But after the surprise revelation that despite what Roy had led the District Court and the government to believe, Little Bird in fact had a Social Security Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.900" offset="1301839">Roy claimed at that point that he was instead concerned more with the use and dissemination of the number rather than having to provide it to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.757" offset="1333186">In any event, the District Court held at the conclusion of the trial that the Social Security Number requirement was unconstitutional as applied to Roy, and the court enjoined the government from denying welfare benefits based on Roy's failure to provide that number to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.406" offset="1403821">Now, in reaching its constitutional holding, the District Court found as--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="319.778" offset="1429317">How could the District Court have enjoined the government from failing to provide Social Security based on the failure to have furnished the number if the number had already been applied for?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="333.898" stopTime="350.672">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="333.898" offset="1485846">--The District Court enjoyed the government from using or disseminating the number that we already had.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.865" offset="1509669">Of course, we have made a separate objection to the injunction on the ground that our use of the number, which doesn't require any action or belief on the part of the appellee, wouldn't violate the First Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="350.672" stopTime="352.843">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="350.672" offset="1552928">What was the District Court's response to that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="352.843" stopTime="462.986">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="352.843" offset="1561601">The District Court's response was not much of a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.248" offset="1575184">It held that this was the only way to protect the perceived First Amendment rights of Roy.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.666" offset="1604859">Now, as I said, the District Court did find that Roy had a sincere religious objection, and we are not objecting to that here, but by the same token, the District Court also found that the government had a compelling interest in using Social Security Numbers in order to effectively manage programs of this size to verify eligibility and the amount of benefits and to ferret out and deter fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.406" offset="1699841">And despite Roy's attempts to argue otherwise in this Court, I don't think there can be any serious objection to that finding by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.498" offset="1732233">There really can't be any doubt that the government has a compelling interest in seeing that $20 billion a year in welfare benefits are targeted to the people that Congress meant to receive them, and it is undisputed that the use of Social Security Numbers is instrumental in accomplishing that important objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.523" offset="1804330">Now, the District Court failed to have found that there was a compelling government interest in using Social Security Numbers, and the question under the free exercise clause therefore became whether the government had any less restrictive means available to it to accomplish that objective in a way that wouldn't interfere with Roy's religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.779" offset="1881339">We believe that the District Court was plainly wrong in the way it went about answering that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.402" offset="1903805">I think the District Court first of all failed to appreciate that under this Court's free exercise cases any less restrictive alternative imposed on the government must be... must actually be capable of achieving the governmental... the compelling governmental interest, at least to the same extent that the challenged provision would achieve that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.675" offset="1992935">And we also think that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="462.986" offset="2002130">Well, Mr. Geller, didn't the court's findings below say that exempting Little Bird of the Snow from use of the Social Security requirement could be accomplished in this case without any increased expenditures to the government and could be done effectively?</text>

            <text syncTime="486.945" offset="2097947">I hope to elaborate on this, but the Court has never asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.787" offset="2117382">When the Court has found that there was a compelling government interest and there was no less restrictive alternative available to the government, the Court has never gone on to ask whether it makes any difference if we just exempt one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.001" offset="2162208">And a number of this Court's cases in fact--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="505.718" offset="2173075">Well, certainly language in Sherbert against Werner and Thomas against the Review Board cut in the direction of making an individual--</text>

            <text syncTime="517.682" offset="2220931">--I think, Justice O'Connor, that case like Sherbert are explainable by the fact that the Court there found and I think quite correctly that there was a less restrictive alternative available to the government in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.928" offset="2265966">In Sherbert, the purported government interest was to prevent fraudulent claims on the unemployment insurance fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.535" offset="2292298">The way the state went about avoiding fraudulent claims was to simply wipe out any religious claim to an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.655" offset="2328869">And what the Court said was, there is a less restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.420" offset="2339841">You can engage in an individualized inquiry to see whether a religious claim is in fact fraudulent.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.495" offset="2376203">No, I believe not, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.524" offset="2384353">The court here clearly found, and I hope to read some of the court's findings in a few moments, that there was no less restrictive alternative that was equally effective as the Social Security requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.724" offset="2425104">The Court in Sherbert made the opposite finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.989" offset="2442136">The Court in Sherbert didn't find that there was no less restrictive alternative, but it didn't much matter whether Mrs. Sherbert got her benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.376" offset="2471707">That is precisely what the District Court found here.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.390" offset="2479753">We think there is absolutely no precedent in this Court's free exercise cases for that sort of a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.967" offset="2502113">Now, I don't think the Court should need any convincing about the massive nature of the government programs that we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.165" offset="2542864">There are about eleven million people who receive AFDC benefits each month, and there are about 20 million people who receive food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.505" offset="2576197">And eligibility for both programs has to be redetermined periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.815" offset="2601483">With AFDC, I think it is every six months, and with the food stamp program, it is once every month or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.563" offset="2624471">And that means that for 20 or 30 million recipients, there have to be periodic determinations about their eligibility for these benefits, and as I said earlier, the way those programs are run, the income of each family member, including children, has to be taken into account in determining whether a family is eligible for benefits and the amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.477" offset="2712138">It seems self-evident that the only way you can run a program like this, the only way you can keep track of eligibility and verify what you are told and deter fraud is through the use of computers.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.830" offset="2757486">And computers talk to each other through unique... through standardized data formats that use unique personal identifiers.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.267" offset="3863302">Now, in addition to the points I also made, it seems clear that we need the Social Security Number to ferret out fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.171" offset="3898933">For example, if two families were to apply for AFDC benefits trying to claim the same child, unless we have that child's Social Security Number, we would never be able to determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.149" offset="3942819">So, we think it is clear that in terms of achieving the propelling government interests that are involved here, program integrity, eligibility verification, and ferreting out fraud, there is no alternative to the Social Security requirement that works anywhere near as well as the one mandated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.860" offset="4029650">And I must say that even the District Court was forced to acknowledge that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.046" offset="4046368">I think it is useful in this regard to look at the District Court's precise fact findings which appear at Pages 7A and 8A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.149" offset="4098822">There, for example, Finding Number 60, the District Court clearly finds that the efficient operation of these welfare programs requires the use of computer systems that utilize unique numerical identifiers such as the Social Security Number, and Finding 62, such systems ensure greater accuracy in providing benefits and in reducing fraud, and aid in the coordination of information in various welfare systems to ensure the recipients are not receiving duplicate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.872" offset="4221702">And on Page 3A, And on Page 8A, the Court finds in Finding 64 that using names instead frequently is not sufficient to ensure the proper payment of benefits, and again, Finding 74, and again, Find 74, the Court finds that without Social Security Numbers you would not be able to do effective cross-match.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.317" offset="4287426">So, the Court has found here that there is a compelling government interest in using Social Security Numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.737" offset="4313130">The Court has also found in the findings that I just read to the Court that there is no less restrictive alternative such as the use of names that is equally as effective as Social Security Numbers in achieving the government's compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.014" offset="4366211">Now, that should have been the end of the inquiry under this Court's free exercise cases, but instead the Court nonetheless concluded that the government should be required to accept admittedly less effective alternatives simply because, as the Court candidly announced, the benefits that Little Bird sought were only an insignificant fraction of the federal government's expenditures for the entire AFDC and food stamp program, so what does it matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.299" offset="4475403">We think this Court... this analysis is completely misguided under this Court's free exercise decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.187" offset="4502988">For example, in Braunfeld against Brown, the Court rejected a free exercise challenge to the Sunday closing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.184" offset="4530992">The Court found that the state had a compelling interest there, that there was no less restrictive alternative available to accomplish that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.039" offset="4562339">The Court didn't go on and then ask what would be the harm to allow a few merchants to stay open on Saturday... on Sunday?</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.880" offset="4597761">That was just not part of the free exercise analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.457" offset="4608001">By the same token, in Prince versus Massachusetts, the Court rejected a free exercise challenge to a state's child labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.516" offset="4648229">The Court once again found that there was a compelling state interest in protecting the welfare of the state's children, and that there was no less restrictive alternative available to the state, and that was the end of the court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.168" offset="4694832">The court did not go on, as the District Court did in this case, by asking what would be the harm to allow one 12-year-old to distribute a religious tract under the supervision of her parent?</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.598" offset="4764631">I believe that was the analysis that the Court applied, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.097" offset="4778633">It was enough in those cases, and again in United States against Lee the Court found that there was a compelling government interest in having every employer contribute to the Social Security fund, and that there was no less restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.590" offset="4828579">The Court again did not go on and do what the District Court did in this case, which is to ask, what would be the harm nonetheless in just exempting a few Amish from the Social Security System?</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.385" offset="4871733">In fact, if the Court had asked that question, if the Court had asked that question, as I think Justice Stevens pointed out in his concurring opinion in Lee, the Court probably would have concluded that the system wouldn't have been hurt at all, because the Amish are also opposed to receiving Social Security benefits, and the receipt of benefits frequently costs more than you take in in taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.063" offset="4950414">But the Court... that was not the question that the Court asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.594" offset="4960549">By the same token here we think that the District Court should have stopped after determining as it did that the government had a compelling government interest in using the Social Security Numbers, and that there was no less restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.181" offset="5018959">It doesn't matter, we think, that only a few people might seek an exemption from the Social Security requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.006" offset="5050201">It also doesn't matter that the government's compelling interest wouldn't be totally frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.521" offset="5068278">The AFDC program wouldn't collapse if we had to pay little Bird in the Snow the benefits without being able to verify whether she was entitled to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.361" offset="5099625">That wasn't part of the test that this Court has consistently used in the free exercise area, but we can't subscribe to the principal notion that seems to underlie the District Court's opinion, which is that a little bit of ineffectiveness or a little bit of fraud really doesn't matter when you are dealing with a program of this size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.773" offset="5189277">I might add that that is precisely what the appellees argued in the District Court, and I think it is once again instructive to look at the record.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Gildin</label>
            <text syncTime="1684.852" offset="6889640">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before this Court today are the parents of now five-year-old Little Bird of the Snow Roy, whose religion, founded in native American beliefs, tells them that in order to preserve their daughter's spiritual purity, they may not provide a Social Security Number for her even if it means foregoing necessary welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.996" offset="7006146">As this Court has plainly demonstrated in its free exercise decisions, it does not respond to these beliefs by either rejecting them because they may seem to others unorthodox nor replying, well, that since Congress requires generally a Social Security Number, it must be provided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.552" offset="7076363">Rather, it is the majesty of our Constitution and its profound respect for religion that this Court accepts these beliefs when as here they are undisputably religious and sincere, and ask the question, can the government reasonably accommodate these beliefs in order to preserve the religion of these native Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.715" offset="7169046">Are there alternatives to the Social Security Number which can in fact satisfy the government's interests while at the same time preserving the spirit of Little Bird of the Snow, and this is done not to afford the Roy family any favored treatment on account of its religion, but rather to avoid unequal treatment which the free exercise clause precludes and Congress did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.237" offset="7259116">The District Court in fact held that there is no need in this case to either sacrifice the Roys' religion nor sacrifice governmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.139" offset="7302793">Because the core of the government's position seems to be its disagreement with the District Court's express findings of fact, I would like to begin by examining those findings and briefly why they are not clearly erroneous, but to the contrary are quite obviously correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.648" offset="7364755">Contrary to Mr. Geller's representations, the District Court did not find that accommodating a little fraud, rather, allowing a little fraud, is the type of accommodation required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.986" offset="7422120">Rather, it expressly found in both findings of fact 85 that in fact alternatives to the Social Security Number can in fact satisfy the government's interest in preventing fraud, alternatives as noted in findings 82 and 84 which require no modification to the government's computer system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.140" offset="7758786">The alleged conflict there was that perhaps the formatting of information in the computers between two states would not be common, that one state may use four letters of the last name and the other would use in fact the full last name, and that we may not be able to in fact do the searches because of the same format by the computer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.348" offset="8511635">As the District Court found, we do the very same computer searches without the Social Security Number, and indeed I think it may be reasonably inferred that given the rarity of these exemptions, we are likely to see at least equal if not greater scrutiny, given the unusual nature of such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.013" offset="8582270">And we think that you may not, as this Court suggested in Sherbert and Thomas, simply deny an individuals' free exercise of religion based upon the government's ability to simply hypothesize a situation which results in a flood of exemptions, because that would result in denying free exercise in virtually every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.412" offset="8659801">What the Court is required to do, and we think sensibly, is to not only take a look at the past, but try to project the future based upon evidence and common sense as to whether there are likely to be a rash of exemptions, and absent the economic incentives here which distinguishes this case significantly from the lead case, it is not likely that this is about to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.513" offset="8744229">With respect to the District Court's findings of fact, it is significant that its findings by all purposes served by the Social Security Number may be accomplished by alternative means of identification was not arrived at by accepting the testimony of the witnesses we called and rejecting the testimony of the government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.690" offset="8832941">Rather, those findings were based upon evidence which issued from the government's very own witnesses, which conceded that in fact these searches not only can be but have been done without the Social Security Number.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.998" offset="9190192">In 1977, Judge Weinstein from the Eastern District of New York ordered the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide benefits to the Stephens children without requiring a Social Security Number because, as here, there were religious objections lodged by the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.834" offset="9261558">Each and every one of the government's witnesses was asked what happened after the Stephens case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.893" offset="9293741">Was there any problem with conducting the searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.674" offset="9304921">And as the District Court noted, no witness was aware of any harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.720" offset="9321117">It is important that at no time did the government contend that these searches could not be done without a Social Security Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.091" offset="9350584">If one consults the affidavit of Mr. Herrin which was filed in support of the summary judgment motion by the government, Paragraph 9 of that affidavit at Page 23 of the joint appendix explains what the problem is if we don't have a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.852" offset="9409620">And that is that without a Social Security Number, were we to search by name only, we would have duplication in the sense that there may be many files which would share a certain name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.393" offset="9451730">And what would be required would be to do additional searches, according to Mr. Herrin, using additional identifiers such as date of birth, county of residence, parents' names, and the like, and he did not say that those would be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.496" offset="9516200">Indeed, if we look at the government's own evidence, which indicated that there were 55,000 persons nationwide with the last name of Roy, and simply adding one identifier, the first name Stephen, reduces it to 32 persons nationwide without regard to adding middle initial, date of birth, county of residence, parents' names, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.394" offset="9603762">The vice of the absence of a Social Security Number, as that affidavit indicated, that searches might take more time, these additional searches, not that they would be unworkable or unreliable, but would take more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.514" offset="9656216">We learned at trial that there is no need for additional searches, because given the sophistication of computers, each and every search includes not only name and Social Security Number, but includes date of birth, county of residence, in some instances parents' names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.476" offset="9732076">And indeed, within the searching system, the Social Security Number is not given the greatest weight amongst the various factors searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.253" offset="9767184">That is, the factors of name, date of birth, and county of residence cumulatively have three and a half times the weight of a Social Security Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.454" offset="9804069">Searches can be done without this number reliably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.936" offset="9817966">It is not the infallible identifier, which is why it is given less weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.278" offset="9839282">As Congress itself has recognized, many people have more than one Social Security Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.119" offset="9862688">A person attempting to defraud the government could provide only one of those numbers in an application for welfare benefits, and if he was receiving benefits under another number, searching under the number provided alone would not identify that particular attempt to defraud the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.787" offset="10049307">The question was asked as to whether this was a situation where we are just exempting one person, and the trial judge went beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.617" offset="10172709">He also determined that there are not likely to be a great number of exemptions sought based, as I noted, on past history, which indicated that there had only been four to date.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.774" offset="10485343">When you get down to the fact that individuals with beliefs where they do not have the ability to either inform, much less influence the political process, at some point we agree that even with beliefs that are not mainstream, the numbers may be large enough to present problems for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.188" offset="10554933">It is not idiosyncratic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.063" offset="10562456">It is unfortunate that we cannot accommodate all such believers, but certainly we should not adopt a rule that says, since ultimately we are going to have to draw a line here, that we should therefore disregard protection of all religious beliefs because of our need eventually to deny an exemption based upon the number of believers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.790" offset="10633405">As this Court noted in Zorach, constitutional rights are a matter of degree, and certainly at some point when accommodation ceases to be reasonable, we have to draw a line and deny the exemption, even if we regret doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.144" offset="10682828">But that certainly does not follow logically that therefore we should deny exemptions where in fact we are able to accommodate it.</text>
