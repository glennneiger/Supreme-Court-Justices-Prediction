            <text syncTime="159.299" offset="777581">I will be addressing two questions in my argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.167" offset="788970">First I will address the manner in which the trial justice conducted the hearing that concluded that the presence of the troopers was permissible, and then I will address the broader question of whether Flynn in this case was denied a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.475" offset="838289">I would briefly like to review some of the important facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.194" offset="849156">This was a four month long trial that occurred in the summer of 1976 in Providence, Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.580" offset="874652">The case involved a major robbery, perhaps one of the most celebrated trials ever in Rhode Island history, the robbery of the Bonded Vault warehouse in Providence, Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.520" offset="910387">In addition to armed robbery charges, there were kidnapping charges and weapons charges against, lodged against the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.626" offset="938809">There were actually eight co-defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.328" offset="957617">Two of them, however, were not tried with Flynn and the others because they were at large at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.998" offset="980291">Those were defendants Macaskill and Lanou.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.850" offset="991785">Five other defendants were tried with Flynn, as I pointed out earlier, so six defendants were tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.587" offset="1014668">Three were convicted and three were acquitted at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.039" offset="1032536">All of the defendants at this trial were held without bail and therefore were, under Rhode Island law, in the custody of the Rhode Island State Marshal.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.745" offset="1063360">Were they held with... when you use the term were held without bail, do you mean they were unable to raise money bail or that the trial court would not allow them to be free even if they had raised money bail?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.286" offset="1105470">It was that they, they were... the trial court would not allow them to be free, and perhaps this is... this may be an esoteric point of Rhode Island law.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.190" offset="1133160">However, these defendants were specifically determined prior to trial not to be entitled to bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.177" offset="1157088">So it wasn't a situation where they were indigent defendants who couldn't afford to make bail, as perhaps this Court referred to in the Estelle v.

            <text syncTime="321.671" offset="1426985">It became clear to the individuals charged with maintaining custody of these defendants that with the force of marshals that they had at their disposal, they could not maintain the proper ratio of security personnel to defendants in the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.944" offset="4196173">And the First Circuit concluded from that that that failure was constitutionally erroneous, that the focus of the state trial judge should have been on the defendants and their particular characteristics, not on the need to maintain an ordinary ratio of security personnel to defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.239" offset="4277258">But I would point out that even the absence of the specific findings by the trial judge in state superior court in this case focusing on the specific defendants and their characteristics, even the absence of those findings, I would suggest, is not fatal to the conclusion that the trial judge reached, and the reason for that is that there are specific facts that are clear from this record with regard to these defendants, factors which the First Circuit suggested from the American Bar Association Guidelines, that ought to be considered by a trial judge in deciding on security issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.995" offset="4416333">One factor is that this particular defendant, Mr. Flynn, had a prior record of escape, and that is clear from the record of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.285" offset="4453532">Another factor that the American Bar Association standards suggest is that accomplices of the individuals on trial were at large during this trial, which in and of itself, according to the American Bar Association comments, creates a possibility of some need for security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.912" offset="4523958">Also relevant factors that I would submit were well known to the trial judge are the fact that two of the state's witnesses were in the protection program, so that the issues before the trial judge in considering whether or not to permit the troopers to remain were very clearly weighed in favor of permitting them to remain, and in fact, he then conducted an extensive voir dire, a voir dire which concluded with factual findings on his part--</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.643" offset="11306913">Yes, ore or two points, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.928" offset="11320079">With regard to the issue of bail, it's very clear that under Rhode Island law at the time this case was tried, a pretrial detainee could be held without bail only upon a showing that he had a propensity to flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.688" offset="11371070">I have cited at pages 9 and 10 of my brief, in Footnote 3, the case of Lemme v. Langlois in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that a subsidiary finding to holding without bail is a danger that the individual may seek to flee, so that that, I think, is part of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.632" offset="11438884">The initial judge must have made that conclusion with regard to all of the defendants in this case, that they had that propensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.535" offset="11462498">With regard to Mr. Justice Marshall's questions regarding the difference between guns and uniforms, I would refer to pages 23 and 24 of our brief in which we discuss the concession by Flynn's trial counsel that he would have been happy if these troopers had been moved somewhere else and done some other kind of duty, and if state marshals had been brought in to replace them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.801" offset="11555599">So I would submit that that clearly indicates that he would have been happy with marshals, and he's not... he's not complaining about--</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.073" offset="11584647">--Uniformed, uniformed marshals, certainly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.440" offset="11594155">And with regard to hats, just finally, there's nothing on this record to suggest that these troopers wore hats in the courtroom, and I would suggest that they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.528" offset="11626443">Unless the Court has any other questions, I would rest on my brief.</text>
