            <text syncTime="14.391" offset="206079">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.360" offset="217991">This case raises an issue involving the interpretation of the language chosen by Congress when it enacted Section 1988 of Title 42 which provides that a trial court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="295209">Specifically, this case raises the question of whether an award of attorney's fees seven times the amount received by the plaintiffs in a private action resulting only in monetary relief can possibly be deemed reasonable under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.016" offset="360620">More broadly, this case also raises the question of whether Section 1988 mandates some relationship between the results obtained by a prevailing party in a civil rights action and the fees which a trial judge may award thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.560" offset="426762">As such, it caused them to question the efficacy of the continued use of the lodestar approach to fee calculations in cases which are essentially private court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="473051">It is the position of the Petitioners that the lodestar approach in a case such as this, rather than producing a fee which is presumptively reasonable, can often, as here, produce a fee which is unreasonable on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.057" offset="720796">It is likewise Petitioners' belief that a fee calculated on the same basis as fees for similar litigation in a given community not only provides a more accurate reflection of the true value of legal services rendered in a private 1983 case, but, moreover, would produce a fee more consistent with the goals of Congress when Congress enacted 1988, which is, of course, a fee that is reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.643" offset="947121">Factually, this case began following an altercation between the Respondents and various members of the Riverside City Police of Riverside, California, in August of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.153" offset="997172">Thereafter, the Respondents filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against 32 defendants, including the City of Riverside and its chief of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.778" offset="1043670">Their action included civil rights claims as well as a mixed bag of pendent state claims, including claims for assault and battery, claims for property damage, infliction of emotional distress, malicious prosecution, defamation, false arrest and false imprisonment, and simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.406" offset="1118171">In addition to seeking money damages, the Respondents herein sought wide-ranging injunctive and declaratory relief as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.262" offset="1149622">Ultimately the matter was tried to a jury in 1980 and when all was said and done Respondents recovered jury awards against only six of the 32 defendants against whom they had litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.801" offset="1195807">No police officer above the rank of lieutenant was found to have any liability to any of the Respondents and 26 of the defendant officers, including 17 who had been previously dismissed by the first trial judge assigned to hear this case on summary judgment, 26 of the defendant officers were found to have no liability to any of the Respondents on any theory whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.509" offset="1782621">They were fully recompensed for the time they spent pursing the 26 defendants who were found to have no liability, any of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.143" offset="3473162">But, Congress, when it passed 1988, I don't think was looking to provide access for the marginal or less than good case.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.735" offset="3527497">We have triers of fact who give value to these cases and they are the jurors and in this case the jurors said the value of this case was $33,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.656" offset="3559157">In other cases, the value might be less, but certainly the trial judge would retain some discretion to raise a fee if the value of the case in the trial judge's mind was in excess of that set by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.998" offset="3612551">Briefly, on the facts, a petition for certiorari was filed in this case initially and was granted by this Court which vacated the first award of attorneys' fees herein and remanded the matter back to the district court to be considered in light of this Court's then recent decision of Hensley versus Eckerhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.062" offset="3692799">Thereafter, at spreading of the mandate from the Ninth Circuit, the trial judge announced that it was going to reinstate its previous award to the penny and subsequently did exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.085" offset="3732923">Petitioners again appealed and once again the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court and then this Court granted cert last October.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.607" offset="3763017">I believe the legislative history of Section 1988 makes two things clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.659" offset="3783183">First, Congress' purpose in passing the legislation was to provide civil rights plaintiffs with effective access to the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.665" offset="3815261">Secondly, in so doing, Congress' intend as to any fees to be awarded thereunder were to be adequate to attract competent counsel but not so large as to result in windfalls to the attorneys involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.425" offset="3870223">Congress called such fees reasonable and left it up to the trial courts to decide what a reasonable fee would be in each individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.281" offset="3905645">Since the passage of Section 1988, however, this Court and other lower appellate courts have provided numerous guidelines to be followed by trial courts to aid calculation of such fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.688" offset="3955278">Heretofore, it appears that this process required the district court to make two distinct calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.842" offset="3979937">First, the district court had to determine the lodestar figure, that is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.281" offset="4017658">Secondly, the district courts had to examine the relationship between the claims on which counsels' efforts were expended in light of the ultimate relief which was obtained by those efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.588" offset="4062902">In that regard, this Court has stated in Hensley that where a plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award such fees as are reasonable in relation to the results obtained by the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.663" offset="4115252">However, the fee award here, nearly a quarter of a million dollars, following judgments aggregating $33,350 in a tort suit brought solely for the monetary benefit of the eight respondents, is not one which under any stretch of the imagination could be called reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.243" offset="6073495">Yet after arriving at the lodestar figure in this case, the District Court failed to meet its duty both under Blum and under Hensley to adjust the lodestar figure to fit the degree of success achieved to insure that the fee herein was proper, that it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.787" offset="6139741">We would argue that where the lodestar fee such as here exceeds or equals the damages recovered by a plaintiff in a case resulting solely in that form of relief that the lodestar produces an unreasonable fee and should be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.999" offset="6212571">On the other hand, the free market test of contingency fee arrangements in general use in a given community not only provide a more accurate reflection of the true value of a fee petitioner's service in a private tort action, which this was, but also produces a fee more consistent with the goals of Congress when it enacted Section 1988, again, a fee that is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.412" offset="6298252">For these reasons, petitioners suggest the implementation of new guidelines to be followed by district courts awarding fees under Section 1988, guidelines, which if adopted, would preclude the kind of result which has occurred herein.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.785" offset="7687653">The distinction is that Congress and this Court invited this attention said we don't want courts, district courts or the Supreme Court, to muck around with the incredibly difficult finding of whether or not one case, one right, one remedy, equals more social value than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.647" offset="7759124">What is important in civil rights cases, as it has been important in antitrust cases, in fair trade cases and the like, is that Congress makes the decision as a matter of national policy that some classes of cases deserve national attention through private litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.958" offset="8552411">Then the question becomes do they overlap sufficiently, thus that it may be fairly said that you can't distinguish between the unsuccessful and the successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.230" offset="8589505">While I think there are always sensible arguments to be made by the losing party which says some of the claims weren't successful, others were, separate them... In order to be successful with that, you would have to demonstrate that something in the record, something in the trial transcript, which I might add was never ordered here, would justify the substance of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.993" offset="8676545">While the argument might obviously be sensible and, indeed, reasonable, it was, after very careful analysis, and twice rejected by a district court, a district court that I might add which add probably significantly greater experience in major litigation and with respect to police abuse than most other district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.807" offset="8751777">The second question, whether or not the size of the damage alone might itself be reason--</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.233" offset="8813531">The second question, namely whether or not the size of the damage alone, might offer reason for the petitioners the losing defendants to argue, that the whole amount of the order is not reasonable surely is just the kind of argument among 11 others that this Court, that Congress decided was relevant for what it takes to determine the highly practical question of what should be awarded after winning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.099" offset="8908930">The key thing to understand, however, is that when you isolate that amount of money you are not trying to determine social value but rather whether in light of what the actual damage rules are, Carey v. Piphus, the injuries that were awarded some dollar amount, actually were awarded a dollar amount, that good, experienced counsel might have gotten for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.547" offset="8998791">In this case, that is precisely what the District Court found, namely that this sort of injury is typically awarded, indeed, something less than what we gain and in light of the fact that social value wasn't her job to determine, that was gained through these findings and through the jury's judgment justified the hours expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.509" offset="9074546">If I might elaborate in a slightly different way, while I think that the answer to the question put before this Court, the reason this Court is concerned about the case, is found within the pages of the legislation and its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.535" offset="9134732">It occurs to me that only slightly beneath the surface both of what petitioners' counsel has said and what this Court has asked is the suspicion about what happened in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.026" offset="9576620">For all that was said about what happened before the District Court, conspicuously absent are the findings of the District Court, a peculiar omission, you might understand, in light of the challenge that one should have to make to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.285" offset="9633671">In addition to what Justice Powell underscored, let me just briefly iterate some of those findings relevant to your consideration today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.789" offset="9667735">The District Court found that both the City of Riverside and individual officers, including two of the only three supervising officers involved, participated in lawless, unconstitutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.449" offset="9726354">The District Court also found that this lawless, unconstitutional product was not simply the product of individual acts, but also the product of racial animus, the product of hostility toward the Chicano community in the City of Riverside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.076" offset="9792914">Finally and importantly, the same District Court said that this racially motivated police discrimination, this lawless and unconstitutional conduct, had to be stopped, and I now quote the District Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.586" offset="9854876">"And nothing short of a lawsuit like this could have done this. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.490" offset="9874520">Now, obviously, these findings by the District Court mirror what the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.644" offset="9899180">The jury found after all that the City of Riverside's customs or policies themselves caused a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.833" offset="9935856">They also found that not only did the individual police officers intentionally deprived people on constitutional rights but they did so with malicious intent, the very predicate for the punitive damages that we gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.926" offset="9992280">It was on the basis of those findings, on those specific findings by the trier of fact after four and a half years of discovery and nine days of jury trial, that the District Court found that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.149" offset="10341172">When 1988 was enacted, it had two forms of fee understandings in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.471" offset="10366458">One was an hourly rate and it concluded that most of the people who file civil rights claims typically can't pay the hourly rate of attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.559" offset="10398746">Somewhere in there, I suspect, is your understanding in private practice about what the relationship is between what is recovered and what may be fairly charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.397" offset="10430197">The other type was the contingency fee record; that is the typical understanding which says, listen, for these kinds of cases isn't it true that you shall get a recovery that provides you for taking out attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.472" offset="10482442">It also specifically found, Congress that is, that this simply wasn't working in civil rights claims, that as a matter of empirical understanding too many of these claims giving the damage rules that don't permit you to easily evaluate what a constitutional right is worth, apart from physical injuries, lead predictably to such little money that any sensible P.I. type or anybody else who is not otherwise funded or was not incredibly heroic in time they are willing to give away was simply not taking the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.193" offset="10613368">The result of those definings was to say that much like in many other statutes, it is not simply civil rights statutes, we are going to find that the typical understanding of Justice Rehnquist's or anybody else's practice is not what operates in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.305" offset="10677733">What operates in these cases is we shall make the plaintiff's attorney suffer the difficulty of deciding whether or not a case is worth it, because if it is not going to win, you can put in four and a half years of stuff and nothing shall happen, but if it wins, if it prevails, the single predicate and the critical one, then what shall happen is you are entitled presumptively to a reasonable fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.959" offset="10812421">Actually it differs enormously little which is what my study of all the statutes suggests; that is the fee shifting statutes have actually gone back to something like a hundred years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.584" offset="10850873">These are not novel things, though they typically weren't very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.286" offset="10865710">What happened quickly over time, when people began to discover that as a result of sometimes not terribly careful and sometime very careful empirical study the national investment in particular kinds of rights wasn't being actualized because attorneys simply weren't taking cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.330" offset="10933838">So, what they decided typically was to throw out normal understandings which weren't working and to conclude that given that you had to prevail that people should otherwise be awarded fees that are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.221" offset="10985456">Your next question I suppose should be that you don't mean to ask that we simply invite the District Court discretionless to take a look at these things and having concluded that you prevailed give you all that you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.296" offset="11037701">I think not and clearly Congress never intended that, these courts' three opinion on this question have never said so, nor did we act so presumptuously as to push that either at the District Court or the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.420" offset="11082213">We carefully elaborated precisely what we thought we were entitled to specifically as this Court directed us in light of Hensley and it was exactly that that took into account both the size of the monetary damage, the total award, along with the other 11 features that Johnson made relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.815" offset="11155774">So, while I do think that Congress said you have to throw out normal understanding, not only hourly rates, but most importantly the equivalent of what the Solicitor General proposed and what petitioners now endorse, namely, this effort to relegislate what Congress threw away as an appropriate interpretation of 1988, because those aren't the way that these kinds of cases shall be vindicated in the private market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.949" offset="11252323">There is one final glimmer of something that is ugly about our performance here, perhaps other civil rights attorneys' performance, that I think should be made slightly more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.340" offset="11305926">That is there is either... and this is probably the weaker of the two notions... some sense that plaintiffs, either in this case or in other cases, highly romanticized what has happened to them, that they put a higher dollar figure than actual damage rules permit and, therefore, when confronted with sensible offers, somehow refused them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.219" offset="11373426">Coupled with that is the idea of a lawyer, either who sees the case as an easy winner or for some economically irrational reason given empirical doubt about this case, nonetheless figures this is where I shall gouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.161" offset="11433194">Both those concerns, it seems to me, follows from an understanding which says either this case, Mr. Lopez, or these cases in the aggregate surely concern us because, while you may be right that Congress said this is okay, what is happening is the taxpayers in general are made to foot the bill that is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.606" offset="11506964">The focus is then, you, Mr. Lopez, somehow justify what is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.260" offset="11533609">Aren't you the party that decided that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.378" offset="11542073">This is the way it had to be litigated, you put too much time and charge too high a rate, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.699" offset="11559314">While I think the concern is immensely justified, I think the focus is badly skewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.369" offset="11586063">The party that had most to do with this case going on and on was not the plaintiffs but the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.792" offset="11619709">The defendants were the ones after all, and I speak now of both the City of Riverside and the individual defendants, who decided that after the filing of the administrative complaint, before a federal lawsuit was ever in mind, never to respond by saying that in light of what was done, ultimately unconstitutional and lawless, we shall both apologize and offer you something like what was actually the damages here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.740" offset="11715526">The defendants were the ones that, after refusing to make that offer after the administrative complaints were filed, then pursued without probable cause of finding of the District Court the longest misdemeanor trial in the history of the City of Riverside simply to avoid having the lack of probable cause finding against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.219" offset="11793475">The defendants were the one who, after the filing of the suit and for some four a half years, as a matter of the finding of the District Court, never made a sensible offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.425" offset="11838301">The defendants were the ones, and perhaps this is most critical, most critical in light of Justice Stevens' opinion in Marek v. Chesney and the operation of Rule 68, the defendants were the ones who decided never to make an offer of judgment to both the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs' attorneys who they now describe as gouging, an offer of judgment that would have foreclosed the capacity to gain costs if, in fact, the jury's verdict were, indeed, less than what the offer was, costs in light of Marek, including attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.014" offset="11980617">When that is the behavior of defendants, then you have little doubt about why it took four and a half years to try and get information that was solely in the hands of the defendant and why you went to trial on a case where we knew too, in light of Carey v. Piphus and the actual damage rule, that it was immensely likely that the damage award would be small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.815" offset="12083852">What was important nonetheless was that these clients were treated disrespectfully, not as a highly romanticized matter, but as a kind of insistently practical matter because all they were asking was not to be treated, because they were Chicanos in a place where they lived and worked, in an incredibly and institutionally discriminatory fashion so that the judgment, a monetary judgment to be sure, was thought to subsume the important social value and the deterrent value that at least thus far in this argument has been presumed solely to follow from either declaratory relief or an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.892" offset="12248110">And, if there is concern about what the taxpayers have to pay here, taxpayers who include my clients, I will add, then the real scrutiny ought to be of defendants and defendants' behavior in these kinds of cases, particularly when they have all the tools to put an end to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.068" offset="12308819">If they fail to take advantage of it, it hardly strikes me as an appropriate argument or at least one you ought not make without significant embarrassment to then claim that plaintiffs' counsel are the ones who gouged and plaintiffs are themselves the highly romanticized unrealistic people who don't know that a case actually isn't worth much.</text>
