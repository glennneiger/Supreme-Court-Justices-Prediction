            <text syncTime="88.387" offset="496757">On June 27, 1962, the Kings County Grand Jury returned a true bill indicting Respondent Booker T. Hillery on a charge of first degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.317" offset="564466">Jury selection for the guilt phase of Respondent's trial began on October 23, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.627" offset="589753">Respondent was found guilty of first degree murder and in another phase of the trial the same jury voted unanimously to impose the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.789" offset="698422">Mr. Hillery received two subsequent penalty trials after his first penalty trial was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.801" offset="722455">The third penalty trial was conducted in another county in California in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.721" offset="746070">In both cases, the juries voted unanimously to again impose a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.453" offset="769057">In all, 36 jurors have decided that Mr. Hillery deserved nothing less than death for the brutal murder of Marlene Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.433" offset="808972">Twenty-one years after the initial jury verdict, Respondent's conviction was reversed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.054" offset="855470">Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court found that there had been purposeful discrimination against black persons in selecting the grand jury between 1956 and 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.808" offset="1122442">And, one of the factors that we think the Court can look to in making that decision is the passage of time, the changes in circumstances that have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.756" offset="1166223">Here, again, there was 21 years from the time of the initial jury verdict until the time when the District Court finally issued its opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.290" offset="1448346">What these kinds of cases are looking for is an overall deterrence effect on the criminal justice administration system and we believe that where, for example, the record indicates that there is no continuing history of discrimination, and, in fact, in this particular record, Your Honor, I think it is important to note that when the trial judge made his remarks, he indicated that efforts had begun even before this particular challenge had been made to locate black persons who could serve on the county grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.166" offset="1583869">So, the District Court's finding that this particular motion precipitated a change may not be entirely supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.818" offset="1626501">In fact here the trial judge, who was dead at the time of the evidentiary hearing in the federal court, the trial judge, Judge Wingrove, indicated on the record at the time of Mr. Hillery's motion to quash, that he was making efforts to try to find black people that could serve on the county grand jury before the motion was brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.017" offset="1819284">What the trial judge indicated was that he was looking for a representative cross section of the community to serve on the Kings County Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.951" offset="1858990">He was especially concerned about the ability of the jurors to serve in California's grand jury system which plays a watch-dog role over county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.009" offset="1907265">They oversee the operations of the fiscal aspects of county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.930" offset="1918968">In other words, it is not something that would come easily to every citizen in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.161" offset="1951882">But, if you look at the record as a whole, especially the transcript of the trial judge's remarks, it becomes very clear that the trial judge considered black people to be qualified and capable of serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.327" offset="1996499">So, I think those factors, the factor of the continued history or the history of the county is one thing the Court can look to in determining whether or not this form of constitutional error requires reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.894" offset="3202834">In this particular case, Your Honor, I think there are other factors that are much more telling on the necessity for imposing the harmless error standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.000" offset="3235226">First of all, in this case, black people were serving on trial juries on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.841" offset="3262602">The record is replete with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.294" offset="3268349">There is an acknowledgement in this case, Your Honor, by Mr. Hillery's trial counsel, the attorney that represented him at trial, the attorney who made the motion to quash, that had this case been brought to a preliminary hearing, there is absolutely no doubt in his mind that Mr. Hillery would have been bound over for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.631" offset="3337730">That fact, the fact that there is nothing to remedy... The purpose of the grand jury as noted in the dissent in Rose and in Justice Jackson's dissent in Cassell, the purpose of the grand jury is to provide probable cause to determine whether a trial is to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.482" offset="3421113">And, here, even Mr. Hillery's trial attorney has acknowledge that there is overwhelming evidence to support probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.212" offset="3456012">In fact, the California Supreme Court in commenting on the evidence in this particular case, the evidence of guilt, characterized this case as being overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.598" offset="3497599">The fact that Mr. Hillery received a full and fair trial in front of a jury, the fact that he received three trials... I grant the Court that the second two trials were penalty trials, but a jury deciding whether to impose the death penalty must first obviously be convinced of the Defendant's guilt before they would consider imposing such a harsh penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.835" offset="3626540">You have three separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.882" offset="3634795">All of those unanimous findings beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.145" offset="3647751">Again, the point we made before that jury discrimination was being looked to already by the superior court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.124" offset="3711699">There really is no basis for imposing the kind of relief or deterrence that is addressed in many of the cases, because here the mechanism of change was already in place and there is nothing in the record before this Court which suggests that there is a continuing pattern or a continuing history of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.568" offset="3797485">We think that in these kinds of cases application of the harmless error rule would continue to serve the significant deterrent interest which the Court has espoused on many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.982" offset="3883167">In other words, the process would remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.433" offset="3896959">Petitioner would be required to make a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.228" offset="3912110">The state would have the opportunity if that case has been made to rebut it, then the trial court would make its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.975" offset="3939069">There would still be a finding of whether or not there has been purposeful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.614" offset="3957668">That finding in and of itself is a significant undertaking for the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.552" offset="5181452">The sole claim in this case, and it is a significant one... I don't mean to diminish the claim... but the sole claim here is that there was purposeful exclusion of blacks from 1956 to 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.359" offset="5240698">Our point here is that absent a showing of some prejudice in a grand jury process where black people regularly served on the trial juries, harmless error would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.180" offset="5299944">Harmless error, as I have tried to point out, serves several important functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.006" offset="5323245">It gives effect to the principle that the essential purpose of the criminal law is to decide factual questions regarding the Defendant's guilt and not technical questions regarding the composition of a pre-trial hearing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.062" offset="5399418">Again, in this particular case, where you have three separate juries voting unanimously regarding the Respondent's guilt, you are seriously eroding the public's respect for the criminal justice process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.555" offset="5473397">The public does not and has difficulty understanding why what would amount to close to 23 years now, later we are reversing a criminal conviction that is supported by overwhelming evidence where the trial was fair, where black people participated in the trial juries, simply because blacks were excluded from the grand jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.842" offset="5566602">In the absence of anything that would indicate that Mr. Hillery did not receive a full and fair trial, the law, as we see it, should permit the trial judge to engage in a harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.868" offset="5626684">Finally, again, we would like to point to significant changes in the area of deterrence which we feel are now in place that were not necessarily in place when this Court considered such cases as Cassell v. Texas and Reece and some of the other grand jury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.420" offset="5732845">In the current situation, there is a great deal more public attention focused on such types of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.915" offset="5778925">The media, for example, would surely bring a claim like this in a judicial finding of discrimination to the public's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.176" offset="5815915">There are civil and criminal sanctions for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.284" offset="5828349">There are also public and private agencies that are concerned and are ready to perform a deterrent function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.234" offset="5860114">All of these suggest that deterrence by the courts by way of reversing a criminal conviction are no longer necessary or essential; that the courts can rely on some of these other deterrent mechanisms that are now in place and are now willing to function in order to prevent a reoccurrence of any form of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.426" offset="5960946">The second issue that is before the Court is the question of whether or not there was a significant change in the evidentiary basis of Mr. Hillery's claim when it finally reached the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.485" offset="6009116">We have included in the Joint Appendix the elaborate computer model that was set up to process information and spit out a result that told the District Court supposedly the level of discrimination that was occurring and the possibility that this could have occurred by chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.929" offset="6090932">Here, there was actual testimony offered from citizens of Kings County that was never offered in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.722" offset="6126145">The trial court's remarks contained in the transcript are indicative that the trial court felt that Mr. Goodwin had simply not proven his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.109" offset="6167627">There had been no evidence offered on the size of the county's population of blacks that were eligible to serve or the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.980" offset="6207124">And, this failing lead the trial court to deny the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.822" offset="6218514">Twenty years later all of these failings, these shortcomings, were remedied and were placed before the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.991" offset="6255190">The Ninth Circuit, in a split decision, did affirm the District Court's order, but the dissenting judge there did find that there had been a significant change in the character of that particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.250" offset="6312241">I have been touristing here in Washington a little bit and when I went to the Air and Space Museum I saw what this case represents to me, the Wright flyer on the one hand and the space capsule on the other, and that is what this particular case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.869" offset="6378697">What Mr. Goodwin presented to the trial judge was a Wright flyer of discrimination and what was presented to that Federal District Court judge was a space capsule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.243" offset="7156205">Hillery filed his first petition in Federal Court in 1978, filed in the Northern District of California, the wrong forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.614" offset="7197688">It was a per se petition and it was transferred to the Eastern District of California where Chief Judge Thomas J. MacBride was assigned the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.955" offset="7231020">Judge MacBride, in reviewing Hillery's petition, decided that Hillery had set forth a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury which had handed down the indictment against him in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.807" offset="7294445">He formed that opinion fundamentally based on Hillery's allegations that in the history of Kings County, California, which was formed in 1893, until 1962, there had never been a black person on a grand jury in that county.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.168" offset="7431849">I think if there had been some evidence that in the history of the county there had been a black or blacks on the grand jury, I think Hillery would not have a position here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.617" offset="7473645">I think that would be part of his problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.522" offset="7481273">There are many ways you can look at the problem, because if you got down to the individual grand jury that indicted him and he could show some clear discrimination there, he might have an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.441" offset="7520979">But, the argument basically, as Judge MacBride saw it, was that in the history of the county there had never been a black on a grand jury and that, in his mind, lead him to say... As far as he was concerned, that was evidence which established a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.120" offset="7595689">Now, when he took senior status, the case was assigned to Judge Karlton who had just been appointed chief judge of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.117" offset="7631634">When Judge Karlton took the case he had a problem, because he had the California Supreme Court's decision that Hillery had not established a case of discrimination in the grand jury that indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.095" offset="7687640">He had Chief Judge MacBride's opinion that a prima facie case had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.313" offset="7712509">Now, Judge Karlton was compelled to apply the presumption of correctness doctrine to the California factfinding, although he didn't have to do it to the legal conclusion, but at the same token, he had Judge MacBride's law of the case before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.505" offset="7809266">The first decision in the California Supreme Court was handed down in 1963, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.206" offset="7828075">The second decision was handed down in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.674" offset="7841867">Those are the only two decisions discussed in the problems we are discussing here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.423" offset="7856914">What Judge Karlton did was examine Judge MacBride's order, because the state had already responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.418" offset="7904875">The state had indicated Hillery had exhausted his state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.541" offset="7917413">They argued that the rich had not lied because a full and fair hearing had been held in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.023" offset="7943327">But, Judge Karlton believed that perhaps Judge MacBride's opinion was a little premature for the reason that the mere exclusion of blacks from a grand jury did not necessarily mean discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.797" offset="8006439">He believed there should be some other data in support of that which would tell him whether or not there had been some discrimination in the grand jury process in Kings County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.638" offset="8049802">Furthermore, the state record had not been lodged with the District Court until after the court had issued its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.305" offset="8084388">So, in that regard, he determined to set aside that portion of the order which said it was a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.178" offset="8107898">He was concerned that perhaps Hillery had not had a full and fair hearing in state court, because when he examined the Supreme Court's decision, it basically relied on what Judge Wingrove had said in terms of the fact that he did not discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.469" offset="8169129">It really did not discuss very much of the evidence that was presented other than to relate it to a prior case the California Supreme Court had decided, People versus Burwell, in 1955 and in that case they held the judge's testimony would be indicative of the fact that there was no discrimination and they related the Hillery case to the Burwell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.304" offset="8248437">Judge Karlton wasn't convinced that that was a completely correct analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.583" offset="8269544">So, what he determined to do was utilize the tools available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.145" offset="8283755">Those tools came under the rules that applied at 2254 Proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.439" offset="8304966">He determined to expand the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.110" offset="8315624">And, in that determination, what he did is ask both sides to answer some interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.279" offset="8340284">He indicated in his order that he would like to see some probability analysis to indicate to him whether or not this lack of blacks on a grand jury could have resulted by chance as opposed to discriminatory acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.038" offset="8407366">Hillery responded by providing information to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.348" offset="8436623">There were twelve interrogatories propounded and four of them really related to whether or not there were eligible blacks in the community, what were the total percentage of blacks throughout the various years, and it was that question that lead Hillery to present to the court census data from 1900 through 1970 with a cut-off data at 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.411" offset="9984848">There were three witnesses who testified at the hearing, Evvie Edwards, Joshua Richardson, and Reverend Folsom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.752" offset="10014210">They were elderly black people and they had been in the county long before 1956 and they were still in the county when the hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.719" offset="10042109">They merely testified to the following: That, yes, there were blacks in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.308" offset="10072411">They testified that the major influx came after World War II, that there was a small percentage of blacks in the community until after the war and then it gradually increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.273" offset="10112326">They testified that there were blacks eligible, as they understood it, to be on the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.927" offset="10134896">They had college graduates, people who had gone to colleges around the country and were now into the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.504" offset="10157257">They testified that if they had been asked, they would have served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.034" offset="10179304">But, other than that, I don't think they contributed anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.907" offset="10194873">Now, that testimony was essentially all before the Superior Court, because the Sheriff of Kings County testifying in Superior Court here, and the newspaper man both testified that they had never known a black to on a grand jury in the history of Kings County, which is what the elderly black people testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.040" offset="10275330">They testified that there were blacks in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.898" offset="10286824">Now, with respect to whether there were eligible blacks or not, none of the witnesses testified to that in the Superior Court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.051" offset="10315454">But, Judge Wingrove discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.097" offset="10323604">He indicated, yes, I had considered Lloyd Welcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.877" offset="10338755">That is Bessie Welcher's husband and Bessie gave a deposition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.188" offset="10355996">Yes, I did talk to Lloyd Welcher and I considered him, but then I decided it would interfere with his employment, so I chose not to place him on the grand jury, which must indicate that the court in Kings County was aware that there were eligible blacks, and if there is one eligible black, reason and common sense would suggest there is more than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.149" offset="10439797">So, I don't think the testimony of the elderly black people really altered anything that was before the California Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.255" offset="10468218">In any event, Judge Karlton, in analyzing all of the data that was presented, arrived at the conclusion that Hillery had established a prima facie case of discrimination and that that prima facie case was unrefuted by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.559" offset="10561423">Now, during the hearing itself the testimony from the actuary was taken and he explained his analysis and an interesting part of the problem that comes out of that hearing is that Judge Karlton asked the computer expert would you please do a probability calculation only for the years 1956 to 1962, the years during which Judge Wingrove was the only sitting judge in Kings County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.047" offset="10683363">He selected the people who would be candidates for the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.467" offset="10697051">After the review, he hand-picked the grand jurors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.420" offset="10712933">So, he was Kings County, California, as far as the grand jury was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.511" offset="10729234">He was the policy-making agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.089" offset="10735608">What he did with his pocket calculator was sat down and said, yes, I can do this calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.305" offset="10768417">He worked it out and in that calculation he said there would only be a probability of two chances out of a thousand in that seven-year period you could have had all non-black grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.814" offset="10810422">Now, in Judge Karlton's opinion, he restricted his thinking to those seven years and I think that is very critical to the analysis of whether he really went that far out of the state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.779" offset="10858383">At any hearing, you are going to hear evidence, you are going to hear testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.402" offset="10872803">You can't stop a trial judge from taking evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.777" offset="10882311">I don't know how you would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.652" offset="10885864">As I view the state's position, what they are saying is that Judge Karlton would not sit there and listen to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.383" offset="10920764">What he would do was sit there and say, am I going to hear a word which is going to take this outside of what the state court had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.177" offset="10947931">I don't think you can do that through a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.208" offset="10956081">He is bound to hear something that wasn't presented to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.206" offset="10967993">But, the question is what does he do with once he hears it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.689" offset="10981995">What he did was restrict his thinking to that seven-year period and I think that is very appropriate and very compelling in terms of how he handled the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.357" offset="11012610">He further, in analyzing the rules that apply to 2254 motion, made some conclusions which are all in the record to the effect that if summary dismissal was not... If he couldn't do that at the outset, then the hearing would be mandated, but there was this intermediate stage when he could expand the record, which is what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.521" offset="11097351">He then after that determined that even if something began to come out during the hearing which would significantly alter the posture of the case, he should still have the right to continue on, complete the hearing in judicial economy terms, finalize the case, finish the thing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.919" offset="11182928">So, what he did in any event was make his decision that a prima facie case had been established and it was rebutted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.446" offset="11220963">He issued his order that the writ should issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.365" offset="11240711">This went up on appeal in the Ninth Circuit, upheld Judge Karlton, with the exception of Justice J. Blaine Anderson, who dissented on the basis of... There were new facts and new methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.906" offset="11298808">And, Justice Anderson's opinion is a very interesting one, very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.482" offset="11321168">He really just talks about anything that wasn't presented to the state court.</text>
