            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140472">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Bowen against American Hospital Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.904" offset="172028">Mr. Cooper, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="10.289" stopTime="474.391">
            <label>Mr. Charles J. Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="10.289" offset="181536">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.991" offset="196374">The question in this case is whether Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits a federally assisted hospital from withholding nourishment or medically beneficial treatment from a handicapped infant solely because of that individual's handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="270666">The Court of Appeals, relying on an earlier ruling in the University Hospital case, held that Section 504 has no application in this setting at all, no matter what the circumstances, and therefore invalidated on their face the interpretive guidelines and procedural regulations issued by the Secretary to explain the application of Section 504 in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="370454">In so doing, the Court of Appeals affirmed a nationwide injunction that prohibited the Secretary from taking any action whatsoever, investigatory or otherwise, in an effort to enforce Section 504's non-discriminatory mandate in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.196" offset="433252">Now, there is no question presented in this case concerning the application of Section 504 to any particular set of facts or circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="474735">Rather, this case concerns only the facial validity of the Secretary's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.391" offset="498036">Now, it is our submission that the Court of Appeals was clearly incorrect in concluding that all handicapped individuals who are infants are as a matter of law outside the scope of Section 504 protection insofar as furnishing nourishment and lifesaving medically beneficial treatment are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.756" offset="595421">Therefore, we urge that the Court of Appeals is due to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.725" offset="611303">Now, as I shall explain, the language of Section 504 plainly prohibits a federally assisted hospital program from discriminating on the basis of handicap is this, as well as in any other context concerning a covered federally funded health services program.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.157" offset="697089">And, contrary to the Respondents' claims, there is firm support for this position at every stage of Section 504's evolution, from its origins in Title 6 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, through its enactment in 1973 and its amendments in 1974 and 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.872" offset="795936">The Secretary's construction of Section 504 is also supported through a consistent administrative construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.795" offset="827597">Turning first to the text of the Act, Section 504 provides in pertinent part as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="180.068" offset="860720">"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="198.529" offset="934490">Now, this language is majestic in its sweep, as one member of this Court described the almost identical language of Title 6 of the '64 Civil Rights Act, which was the model for Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.122" offset="992900">And this Court also noted in the Grove City case recently that it is very reluctant to read into the largely identical language of Title 9, involved in Grove City, a limitation not apparent on the face of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1050578">And it is with these principles in mind that we are met at the threshold by Respondent American Hospital Association, who argues that a handicapped infant is not a handicapped individual within the meaning of Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.824" offset="1119750">Now, the Court of Appeals rejected that argument and agreed with us that, of course, infants are entitled no less than adults to the protection of Section 504, that they have physical and mental impairments that limit major life activities, which is the statutory definition of what a handicapped individual is.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.791" offset="1215568">The court also noted, and we certainly concur, that to say otherwise defies common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.112" offset="1248900">Indeed, this Court in Smith against Robinson stated that 504 applies to all individuals without respect to their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.337" offset="1285785">The Court of Appeals below did conclude, however, that handicapped individuals are not otherwise qualified, which is also a requirement of Section 504, and that was a requirement that this Court scrutinized very closely in Southeastern Community College against Davis, and there it held that an otherwise qualified handicapped individual is someone who is able to meet all of the requirements of the program in spite of his handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.510" offset="1430503">Now, the requirement in Section 504 that a handicapped person be otherwise qualified simply reflects a Congressional recognition that a handicapping condition may be relevant, a relevant consideration, in some contexts, and that when it is relevant 504 doesn't require that it be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.041" offset="1528619">Thus, in the Davis case the ability to communicate effectively was very relevant to whether or not a person could function properly in a nursing training program, and the ability to communicate effectively was a legitimate requirement of that training program, and therefore a deaf person who could not meet that neutral requirement was not admitted and 504 did not require a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.263" offset="1657455">In the context of medical care, the principal requirement for administering treatment is that it be medically indicated, that it be beneficial to the health or to the life of the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.420" offset="1710118">That also is a neutral requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.206" offset="1721194">It applies whether the patient is handicapped or whether he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.110" offset="1744808">And the existence of a handicapping condition may well bear, and bear very importantly, on the question of whether certain treatment strategy is medically indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.270" offset="1797471">That is, whether or not it is likely to be beneficial to the life and the health of the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.607" offset="1822862">And when a medical professional concludes in good faith that the disabilities arising out of a handicapping condition render certain medical treatments contraindicated, that is not beneficial to the life and health of the patient, Section 504 does not require that the treatment be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.389" offset="1917948">But when a patient is denied treatment that is medically beneficial, such as let us say corrective surgery to unblock a blocked esophagus, and is denied that treatment solely because he's afflicted by some handicap, such as Down's Syndrome, it is claimed that that individual has been discriminatorily denied the benefits of a health care program.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.353" offset="2833801">Oftentimes, or at least not infrequently, hospitals are faced with the responsibility essentially to seek to override parents' refusal to consent to some clearly beneficial treatment, surgery or the withholding of nourishment itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.565" offset="3822692">From what I have previously said, however, we think it's clear that Section 504 does not reach, let alone attempt to interfere with or overrule, a health care decision that is within the realm of accepted professional medical judgment, because under those circumstances it can't be said that the handicapped patient has been denied beneficial medical treatment that would have been provided but for the handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.001" offset="3944423">And therefore, in light of these facts, what Respondents essentially seek from this Court is an exemption from the application of the statute, an exemption that permits them to make decisions that are based not only on handicap, but that are outside of the scope of professional medical judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.219" offset="4041285">In the context again of a handicapped infant whose parents have refused to consent to treatment, the analytical mode is to different than if the refusal was based on religious scruples and the doctor happened to be the same religion and concurred in that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.767" offset="4143476">Under those circumstances, hospitals, at least hospitals that became aware of the course of treatment or non-treatment that was agreed upon, would typically under state law be required to petition a court for review of that kind of decision.</text>

Title 6 if... or Title 6 of the '64 Civil Rights Act, if we are talking about medical decisions that are based on race, though candidly those are much more far-fetched than these, but in the context of a decision that is based on the existence of a handicap or a handicapping condition that in no way contraindicates the treatment that would be life saving to the handicapped individual, 504 suggests that the same procedures that are available to hospitals to review that kind of decision must be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.646" offset="8075009">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.854" offset="8115865">May I take the opportunity first to present a brief overview of the three basic points that I wish to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.077" offset="8172707">The first is that a decision to withhold medical treatment in a specific individual case, while it may constitute unlawful medical neglect at its worst under the laws of all of the states, it cannot constitute discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.133" offset="8292975">Our anti-discrimination laws, our view of discrimination, concerns the disparate treatment of people according to categories or classifications, such as race and sex and age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.510" offset="8366431">Medical treatment decisions do not constitute disparate treatment by category, but rather are based on the medical treatment needs of the individual, and no two persons' needs are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.806" offset="8435603">Second, in the face of the Government's struggle, if you will, to divine Congressional authority for its regulations under Section 504, the Child Abuse Act Amendments of 1984 demonstrate to us two things: First, that Congress has the capacity to speak clearly to this issue when it so desires; and that when in fact it did so in the fall of 1984, Congress acted to reaffirm the primacy of state regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.281" offset="11561520">The judgment below enjoins the Secretary from using Section 504 to investigate and regulate directly individual treatment decisions relating to severely impaired newborns.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.239" offset="11717419">State child abuse and neglect laws have historically regulated the first two decisions and addressed the vexing and sensitive questions of when states should override parents' treatment decisions for their children and when physicians should come between parent and child under state law and report to state authorities parents for possible medical neglect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.176" offset="12569115">That leaves then the question, because the final judgment regulates treatment decisions, it doesn't regulate child protective service agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.547" offset="12806621">They do not go to the fundamental question here of whether there is any problem with the states not effectively monitoring doctor decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.736" offset="12839326">There's a third reason, beside these two rules of 504 construction, why no deference would go to the agency here, and that is the fundamental rule of General Electric versus Gilbert about inconsistent agency interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.378" offset="12885928">As I indicated, what we're talking about here precisely, the hook on which the Federal Government tries to get into these intensive care nurseries, is where parents haven't consented what is the responsibility of the provider?</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.435" offset="12930128">In 1982 when the notice was first put out on this subject, they said the responsibility of the provider was to discharge the infant from the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.624" offset="12966908">There was an outcry about this, because that would obviously be inhumane and incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.576" offset="12986761">In 1983 when they put out an interim finial regulation, they said the responsibility of the provider was to override the treatment decision of the parents and provide treatment, neglecting the fact that, as I think Justice O'Connor pointed out, that would of course be a battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.686" offset="13043185">So by the time they got to put out the final req, they then go to this question of whether they can investigate whether providers are discharging their state law reporting duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.893" offset="13084041">We also indicate in our brief at great length why this is not an appropriate area for the Federal Government to be in, because state law reporting duties are state law reporting duties.</text>
