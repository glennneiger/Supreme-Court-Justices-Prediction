          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="351.345" stopTime="1212.591">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="351.345" offset="1535588">He applied the six year statute of limitations, but it's unclear whether the district court viewed the suit as a Tucker Act suit or whether it viewed it as arising under the allotment statute, Section 345 of Title 25, and the jurisdictional counterpart in Section 1353 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.146" offset="1598805">It's our submission that the six year Statute of limitations would apply under either view of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.847" offset="1625658">Of course, a suit under the allotment statute would go to the Eighth Circuit, unlike a Tucker Act appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.583" offset="1652617">Now, it's our submission that, even if viewed as in the nature of a Quiet Title Act suit under Section 345, that Section 345 was never intended, for reasons we have set forth at some length in our brief, to be a basis for a Quiet Title Act suit against the United States arising from the disposition of land after it was once allotted that Section 345, the allotment statute, applies only to disputes arising in the initial process of allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.383" offset="1763794">So it's our view that there was no at all for this sort of suit and that, even jurisdiction if there was, that the Quiet Title Act passed in 1972 has become the exclusive means for adjudication of disputes concerning the United States' title to property, as this Court held just several terms terms ago in Block versus North Dakota in a suit brought by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.386" offset="1851774">And lastly, as I mentioned, that even if this suit does arise under the allotment statute, there is no basis for exempting suits such as that from the six year statute of limitations in Section 2401 that the district court applied, and that in fact the Court of Appeals assumed was applicable, but announced a special rule under which it said that the statute of limitations did not actually run in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.411" offset="1947905">With respect to the approach that the Court of Appeals did take, its particular disposition of the statute of limitations issue was seriously flawed in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.340" offset="2003598">The court relied on this Court's 1922 decision, in Ewert versus Bluejacket, and in that case the Court held that a state statute of limitations does not apply of its own force to a suit, to an Indian land title claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.681" offset="2064934">And the Court did not suggest in Ewert versus Bluejacket that if the state statute of limitations had applied that the period under that statute wouldn't even have commenced because the cause of action hadn't yet accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.689" offset="2121045">And therefore Ewert furnishes no basis for the special accrual rule that the Court of Appeals announced in this case, under which an explicit federal statute of limitations would be rendered inapplicable to a suit brought by an Indian whenever the suit is based on a transaction that is allegedly void.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.793" offset="2197427">And a fortiori, we submit that Ewert doesn't support any such exception to a statute of limitations in a suit against the United States, which is a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore goes to the jurisdiction of the court even to entertain the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.394" offset="2259807">And in fact, if Respondent were connect that the cause of action hasn't even accrued under such a rule, then she presumably has no right to even bring the action and the suit is premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.331" offset="2307559">But of course, that's not her submission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.592" offset="2316649">And I should also note that the Court of Appeals approach to the statute of limitations issue seriously undermines the nature of a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.031" offset="2366387">First, it would require, effectively require resolution of the merits of the dispute, in other woods whether the underlying transaction was void, in order to dispose of what should he the threshold question of whether the suit is barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.709" offset="2421139">And beyond that, it has no connection to the purpose of a statute of limitations, which is to foster repose, irrespective of the merits of the underlying dispute, and to save the courts and the defendants from having to deal with cases in which the evidence might not be available because of loss of memory or loss of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.662" offset="2500865">In fact, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, but didn't give weight in this case to, the Government's submission that it would be difficult to piece together the records of transactions such as occurred here in the 1950's, many years after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.921" offset="2557916">But aside from the particular defect of the Court of Appeals' decision, we thank that it was also wrong, as I have said, in not viewing this case as arising under the Quiet Title Act, because, as this Court said several terms ago, the Quiet Title Act is the exclusive means for challenging the United States' title to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.914" offset="2641926">The Quiet Title Act contains its own statute of limitations, which provides that any civil action under that Act must be brought within 12 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.154" offset="2694903">And the Quiet Title Act specifies when a cause of action shall he deemed to have accrued, and that is within 12 years from the date on which the plaintiff either know or should have known of the claim of the United States to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.361" offset="2747670">In this case, the district court found, on the basis of Respondent's deposition, that she clearly knew of the sale of her land in 1954, and that the cause of action accrued, albeit for Section 2401 purposes, as of that date because she was put on notice of the United States' interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.064" offset="2822485">Moreover, in this case Respondent expressed a desire to BIA in 1967 to sell all of her interests in allotments that she then held, and BIA furnished her with a list of those interests, but did not include any indication that she still owned an interest in the three allotments at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.537" offset="2900434">And so therefore, when Respondent filed this suit in 1981 it was 27 years after the sales, of which the district court said she had knowledge, and 14 years after BIA had confirmed that she no longer held an interest in the three parcels that are at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.518" offset="2964277">So for Quiet Title Act purposes, this suit is clearly barred by the statute of limitations in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.884" offset="2993743">Furthermore, as this Court held in Block versus North Dakota, the statute of limitations applies to all claimants who seek to take advantage of the waiver of sovereign immunity under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.283" offset="3043376">In Block, the Court applied that principle to bar suits brought by states, and the principles the Court applied we think apply equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.308" offset="3079529">First of all, the language of the statute of limitations refers to "any civil action" under the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.663" offset="3104921">There's no exception expressed for suits by Indians, just as there was not for suits by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.386" offset="3131774">Beyond that, there's no suggestion in the legislative history of an implied exception that doesn't appear on the face of the Act for suits brought by Indians, just as there was not for suits brought by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.124" offset="3178795">And in fact, as we have set out in our reply brief, there is acknowledgment of the possibility that suits would be brought by Indians against the United States under the Act, and yet Congress did not fashion a special statute of limitations for Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.893" offset="3233861">And finally, the purpose of the statute of limitations articulated by the Court in Block versus North Dakota was to serve the overriding rational purpose of preventing the national government against stale claims and claims based on evidence that might be difficult to assemble.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.564" offset="3308467">And that policy was perceived by the Court to be one that requires uniform application in order to be effective, and we think that that applies equally to claims brought by Indians as to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.303" offset="3355487">Now, Respondent has suggested in this case that the Quiet Title Act does not apply to this suit because of the provision in the second sentence of subsection (a) of the Quiet Title Act which states that it does not apply to trusts or restricted Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.855" offset="3429675">Respondent claims that these are trust or restricted Indian lands and therefore it falls outside the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.360" offset="3455693">But of course, that assertion begs the very question that would have to be decided on the merits if the case was not barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.788" offset="3497384">And if Respondent were correct, that would mean that the waiver of sovereign immunity that Congress has afforded to all other claimants would not apply to Indians who want to bring claims against the United States claiming that land that the United States claims title to in fact should be deemed to be held in the interest of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.800" offset="3569482">And Respondent hasn't suggested any reason why Congress would have wanted to exclude Indians from the benefit of that waiver of sovereign immunity that was afforded to all other claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.798" offset="3609397">And in fact, the text and legislative history of the Act demonstrates that Congress did not intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.700" offset="3629041">Whether the exception under the Quiet Title Act applies for trust and restricted lands depends on the nature of the interest the United States claims in the land, not the interest that the plaintiff thinks the United States should claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.100" offset="3686615">And in this case it's clear that the United States holds the land for the Forest Service, not in a capacity as trustee for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.585" offset="3724545">And this view of the application of the exception is confirmed by the general consent to suit in the Quiet Title Act itself, which grants consent to resolve disputed title questions to land in which the United States claims an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.914" offset="3781910">It's not dependent upon what it's interest actually is.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.088" offset="3798628">Beyond that, if the United States disclaims an interest the Quiet Title Act does not even apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.272" offset="3823392">And the legislative history, beyond that, indicates to the same effect, that the exception for Indian lands was intended to apply to situations where land is "held in trust for Indians", and in this case the United States is not purporting to hold the land in trust for Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.907" offset="3909910">The purpose was to prevent Indian lands from being subject to suit and challenge by third parties where the United States and the Indians are in agreement about the Indians' interest in the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.465" offset="3964140">It wasn't to prevent resolution of disputes between the Indians and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.208" offset="3983053">And finally, as we pointed out in our reply brief, a provision of the Quiet Title Act in an early draft of it was deleted that would have excluded suits involving lands to which Indians or Native Americans claimed an interest based on aboriginal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.868" offset="4053688">And one of the objections that the Justice Department raised to that was that it might preclude suits brought by Indians against the United States where there was an interest claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.036" offset="4094439">And the provision was deleted from the bill, and we believe that confirms that suits brought by Indians are not intended to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.661" offset="4128921">Now, with respect to the Tucker Act, if this suit does arise under the Tucker Act there is, of course, the jurisdictional question mentioned, but it would be barred by the statute of limitations under 2401(a) in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.816" offset="4221498">That statute of limitations applies to every civil action commenced against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.121" offset="4246785">There's only one exception to that, and that's for a person who is under a legal disability; and the existence of that one exception indicates that Congress has foreclosed other sorts of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.750" offset="4297254">This same principle applies when one considers the application of Section 2401(a) to a suit under the allotment statute, Section 345, if in fact that statute were thought to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.179" offset="4346991">Congress has made the statute applicable to all civil actions, has created one exception for persons under a legal disability, but has not included any exception for suits brought by Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.495" offset="4400281">Now, it has been suggested that there is a limitation to the statute of limitations for situations in which property is held in an express trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.747" offset="4465273">Now, precisely what Respondent means by that isn't clear, and it's not clear that any such concept was intended to be incorporated into the statute of limitations is Section 2401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.515" offset="4520339">However, the Court of Claims, in construing the parallel statute of limitations under Section 2501 of Title 28, has recognized that in a situation where the United States actually holds money in a treasury account and doesn't dispute that it belongs to a particular party, a particular Indian, let's say, in a treasury account, and that the money is already existing, no statute of limitations applies to require the claimant to request that money or sue for it within a particular period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.386" offset="4639771">But that's because the United States in those situations is not disputing that the land... that the money belongs to the Indian and that it's available whenever he requests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.281" offset="4675402">However, if the claimant requested the money and the United States denied that it belonged to the Indian in this case, then that would be a situation where there was a repudiation of an express trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.068" offset="4726498">And even under the rule that the Respondent has advanced in this case, the statute of limitations would begin to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.374" offset="4755755">That rule is reflected in the cases upon which Respondent relies and the other cases that we set forth in our reply brief discussing this express trust concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.300" offset="4791490">So in this case, even if what this Court referred to as the bare trust under Section 5 of the allotment act is the equivalent of an express trust for purposes of application of the rule that Repondent relies upon, in 1954 when the land was sold out of its trust status by the United States there couldn't have been a clearer repudiation of any trust relationship between the United States and Respondent with respect to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.749" offset="4909250">And even under the rule Respondent suggests, that would trigger the running of the statute of limitations at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.045" offset="4938403">And whether the statute of limitations is six years or 12 years, that period would have long since expired by the time this suit was filed in 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.470" offset="5920085">What they did is they decided to sell some Indian land, and they sent out consent forms to thousands of Indians around Leech Lake, Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.271" offset="8467337">It was not a general statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.642" offset="8476845">It was a jurisdictional statute that contained within it a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.983" offset="8494191">And in 4120 it says that the statute of limitations only applies to "under this paragraph".</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.029" offset="8522403">When that was changed in 1948, they moved 24... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.396" offset="8559810">They moved 4120 to 2401(a), and they moved the jurisdictional provision to 1346(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.471" offset="8592098">In other words, all that they did is they combined the statute of limitations for contracts and for torts under one provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.977" offset="8622191">And the revisor, Barron, in his article "The Judicial Code" makes express the following statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.760" offset="8661270">He states that:</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.351" offset="8663673">"Because of the necessity of consolidating, simplifying, and clarifying numerous component statutory enactments, no changes of law or policy will be presumed from changes of language in revision unless an intent to make such change is clearly expressed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.003" offset="8726263">And there was no express intent in the revisor's notes, and there is no intent to change that in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.178" offset="8758968">To go back to the question, again, I think that's why the U.S. never applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.090" offset="8778612">Strictly going by the words, the defense can be raised, but the intent and the purpose I think might change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.127" offset="8818736">There has been some suggestion here that Section 345 only applies to the issuance of original allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.212" offset="8851128">The Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit have all held to the contrary on that, and the language of the statute that I just read talks about exclusion of commencing and prosecuting or defending any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.791" offset="8901387">We think that it's pretty clear that that statute covers ongoing allotments, not just the original issuance 80 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.789" offset="8941407">We feel that the Quiet Title Act did not repeal Section 345.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.132" offset="8966798">What the Quiet Title Act... the position of the Government is saying that in effect Section 345 was repealed by the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.709" offset="9009116">There's nothing to show that that was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.200" offset="9019043">There's nothing to show that it was, and there is some authority to show repeals by implication are not favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.314" offset="9043494">There is also some language in 28 U.S.C. 2415, which really doesn't resolve these problems because it refers to actions brought by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.644" offset="9108800">But here was a lot of work that went into that Act, and we think you can infer Congressional intent there that they did not mean to bar Indian claims without referring to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.613" offset="9160731">The uncertified class action that we have in this case we think is a good remedy, because it doesn't involve bona fide purchasers for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.332" offset="9215588">It doesn't involve the innocent people that may have purchased the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.515" offset="9232307">In the Mottaz case, the Government sold the land to themselves, and we do not get into that question if it's a matter of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.122" offset="9274729">The Caippewa National Forest, with these acres in the middle of it, doesn't really lend itself to anything except monetary compensation, and that's pretty much what the Eighth Circuit said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.852" offset="9329691">So we're proceeding under the election of remedies law that I think is nationwide, although I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.396" offset="9363859">It certainly is in the state of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.457" offset="9372114">It says in rescission cases you can either take the land back as a remedy or go after money damages if the land back isn't appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.495" offset="9412238">And here it seems to be the only workable solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.247" offset="9431255">In the Mottaz case, individually she did not receive payment and the Government has nothing to indicate to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.354" offset="9471693">We do disagree with the Eighth Circuit in one point, and that is that payment itself should not be able to transform non-consent into consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.351" offset="9515683">It takes something more than an Indian getting a check in the mail on the reservation, who would probably cash it without asking any questions, to turn that into consent of his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.158" offset="9558837">If the statute of limitations closes the door here, we feel it would be a wrong without a remedy for literally thousands of people, and we ask the Court not to close the door on these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.908" offset="9617874">They're innocent, they didn't do anything wrong, and they don't deserve that.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2381.657" stopTime="2674.808">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="2381.657" offset="9656849">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.432" offset="9684016">I'd like to respond to the argument that this suit is in fact a suit for an allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.403" offset="9699898">Respondent concedes that in order to win this case she has to establish that she has title, equitable title to the land, and in our view that's just one species of a Quiet Title Act suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.991" offset="9750263">It doesn't matter that Respondent happens to be basing the claim of title on an allotment, just as it doesn't matter what form any other claimant bases a claim of title on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.808" offset="9789446">So in our view this clearly does arise under the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.949" offset="9806060">Now, as we've explained in some detail on our opening brief, Section 345 and its jurisdictional counterpart in Section 1353 of Title 28 was intended to apply only to what Felix Cohen described in a 1942 treatise as a suit for an original allotment, and the language of the Act is not to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.595" offset="9896653">Respondent refers to the language pertaining to prosecuting or defending a suit, and a suit for an allotment or a suit concerning being excluded from an allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.903" offset="9941897">And as we explain in our reply brief, that language embraces suits where there is a dispute between two Indians claiming the entitlement to the same allotment in the initial allotment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.840" offset="9985574">One Indian might already be occupying it and the other one is then excluded from the parcel that he had selected and is claiming should be allotted to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.486" offset="10016189">And in that same situation, the Indian who was occupying the land would be entitled to defend the suit under 345 by the competing claimant for the original allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.561" offset="10056522">So even those phrases don't suggest a broader reading, and in fact other portions of the language suggest to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.527" offset="10084316">The jurisdictional grant in Section 345, after the description of the sorts of suits that can be brought, grants the district courts jurisdiction only over suits involving...</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.515" offset="10132277">"involving the right of any person to any allotment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.756" offset="10149309">It is clear that it's limited to suits seeking an allotment in that fashion, and 1353 is worded in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.633" offset="10180761">And then finally, particularly telling is the nature of the effect of the judgment that is prescribed in Section 345 itself, which says that a judgment in favor of the plaintiff shall have the same effect as if an allotment had been allowed and made by the Secretary of the Interior in the first instance, which obviously refers to the issuance of a patent or other allowance of the allotment in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.365" offset="10267696">The origins of Section 345 are to the same effect, that it arose in an allotment and an appropriation act dealing with the initial allotment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.653" offset="10300819">And as we outline in our briefs, there were four statutes that Congress passed during the 17 years after Section 345 was enacted in 1894, all of which confirm that it's limited to situations involving initial allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.072" offset="10362573">In fact, Congress excluded the Osage and the Five Civilized Tribes from the operation of 345 because disputes over original allotments were otherwise provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.230" offset="10407190">And this Court's decisions in First Moon versus White Tail and most recently in Affiliated Ute also describe Section 345 in similar terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.416" offset="10447941">In First Moon versus White Tail, the Court says that the jurisdictional counterpart has reference to suits for original allotments and it does not involve disputes concerning valid and unquestioned allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.094" offset="10498618">And here no one's questioning the validity of the initial allotment to Respondent's ancestors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.927" offset="10517949">So all of these points, to which Respondent really doesn't answer at all, indicate that 345 in its origins was intended to apply to original allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.542" offset="10560372">The first contrary Court of Appeals decision was an isolated one from the Ninth Circuit almost 50 years later, and the other decisions which Respondent refers to were all in the 1970's, 75 years after the statute was passed, giving it a scope far beyond what was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.312" offset="10619513">Even putting all of that to one side, we come back to the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.836" offset="10637590">This Court said in Block versus North Dakota, in that situation whether an officer suit could have been brought before 1972 was problematic, but that the Quiet Title Act made that remedy exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.763" offset="10685342">Here, even assuming that a suit against... a Quiet Title Act suit against the United States was problematic under 345 prior to '72, the Quiet Title Act makes that remedy exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.350" offset="10727660">In fact, the second sentence of the Quiet Title Act explicitly preserves certain other remedies... Tucker Act suits, suits involving lands, and the McCarran amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.677" offset="10764963">But it does not preserve Section 345 suits or Section 1353 suits as a means of challenging the United States' title to land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.433" offset="10799967">So Congress knew how to preserve other remedies when it enacted the Quiet Title Act and didn't do so for these allotment statutes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2674.808" stopTime="2678.751">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2674.808" offset="10829433">Well, it did refer to Indian trust lands, of course.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2678.751" stopTime="2789.282">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="2678.751" offset="10845211">It referred to Indian trust lands in terms of exempting them where the United States was essentially the defendant on behalf of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.483" offset="10868199">And the fact that it referred to Indian lands I think suggests that Congress would have created an exception for other sorts of remedies against the United States by Indians if it had wanted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.303" offset="10923474">But it did not, and the reason, it's understandable, because only six months earlier in Affiliated Ute the Court had given the narrow construction to 345 that we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.399" offset="10959836">Section 345 also does not provide a damage remedy against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.421" offset="10979898">As we explain, the Tucker Act is the exclusive remedy for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.253" offset="10991288">And then finally, even if Section 345 does apply, the statute of limitations in whether 2401 bars this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.538" offset="11024411">By its terms, Section 2401 applies to every civil action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.781" offset="11045414">There's no exception for suits by Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.854" offset="11053668">And prior to 1948, the six year statute of limitations was in the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction and said suits under this paragraph are barred if not brought within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.980" offset="11094210">In '48, Congress lifted the statute of limitations out and put it is a separate chapter of Title 28 applicable to suits against the United States generally, which would encompass suits under 1353 and 345, and said not... and did not limit it by language, such as suits under this paragraph or suits under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.092" offset="11174667">It said every civil action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.157" offset="11186893">And I would point out that every Court of Appeals that has considered the question of the scope of Section 2401 has rejected the argument that it is limited to suits under the Tucker Act, as its predecessor was, and the Ninth Circuit has applied it to suits under 345.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.794" offset="11245407">And even the Eighth Circuit in this case did not suggest that Section 2401 is inapplicable to suits under Section 345.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.231" offset="11279157">If there are no further questions.</text>
