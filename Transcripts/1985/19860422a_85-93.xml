            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143918">We will hear arguments first this morning in Bazemore against Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.686" offset="170563">Ms. Kuhl, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="11.138" stopTime="357.480">
            <label>Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl</label>
            <text syncTime="11.138" offset="188431">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address in my argument this morning three of the issues raised in this case, but first I would like to articulate briefly our position with respect to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="235556">The first issue concerns the intentionally discriminatory pay disparity between black and white Agricultural Service agents which originated pre-Title 7 and continued after the effective date of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.407" offset="289472">Both courts below agreed on the existence of these disparities, but the Court of Appeals held that because the difference in pay originated before Title 7, the current pay practice was not actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.871" offset="339314">It is our position that a current practice of intentionally paying blacks less than whites on the basis of race cannot be immunized by the fact that the practice began before Title 7's effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.914" offset="391559">The second issue concerns use of the statistics in Title 7 disparate treatment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.723" offset="410785">The issue framed by the private petitioners is whether a statistical analysis must take into account every conceivable nonracial variable before the statistics may be considered probative.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.328" offset="461149">We do not believe that a plaintiff's statistical proof must account for every conceivable factor that might bear on salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.449" offset="489675">Indeed, a statistician would tell us that that is not possible, but we do take the position that the plaintiff here has met the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in proving discrimination on the statistics presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.444" offset="553622">In contrast to petitioners, however, we argue that in order to raise an inference of intentional discrimination, it is necessary for the statistical analysis to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory reason for the disparate treatment, leaving racial discrimination as a logical inference, and we also believe that the plaintiffs must offer statistics raising that inference as part of his prima facie case in accordance with the order of proof set forth in McDonnell-Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.807" offset="671069">Finally, the third issue concerns disestablishment of the pre-Act segregated system of operating 4H and Extension Homemaker Clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.928" offset="707536">Private petitioners now seem to be arguing that the courts below erred in not addressing whether there was current discrimination in recruitment for membership in the clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.892" offset="751422">This is essentially a fact-found question, and although we believe that recruitment was addressed by the courts below, we would have no objection to a remand on that liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.590" offset="794262">However, in their petition, the private petitioners seem to state a different legal issue, that is whether as a matter of law respondent should be held to have failed to disestablish a formerly segregated system when some all white and some all black clubs continue to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.334" offset="869182">On this legal issue, we believe that the court below was clearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.441" offset="885587">A state that has ensured that all of its practices relating to admissions are truly race neutral need not eliminate an open admission membership system that would otherwise be the norm in order to assure a particular racial mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.872" offset="947340">To return then in somewhat more detail to the first issue, the continuing race-based salary disparity, it is important to note that pre-1965 the entire Agricultural Extension Service was operated on a de jure segregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.755" offset="1022886">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that agents working in this system were paid different depending on whether they worked in the black branch or in the white branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.297" offset="1073041">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals also found that this pay disparity was intentionally continued by the service and persisted after 1972, when Title 7 became applicable to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.448" offset="1129675">The error of the Court of Appeals was in excusing this post-Act discrimination on the basis that it originated in the pre 1965 de jure period, but the Court of Appeals analysis, we think, misreads this Court's decisions in Evans and in Hazelwood, and misconstrues the nature of the violation proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.577" offset="1230194">The wrong alleged here is not that the service failed to correct the effects of pre-Act discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.294" offset="1257048">The wrong here is rather a current post-Act practice of paying blacks less than whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.838" offset="1283170">As was stated in Evans, the question is really whether a present violation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.382" offset="1305427">An employer is entitled to treat pre-Act discriminatory practices as to which the time... either pre-Act practice or practice as to which the time has run, as if it was totally legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.096" offset="1368225">Thus, in Evans the firing of the stewardess was merely considered an unfortunate event in history, but there we have something entirely different from a pre-Act promotion or hiring decision or firing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.620" offset="1434367">What we have here is a present violation of the sort that was lacking in Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.195" offset="1460698">The violation here rests solely... does not rest solely on pre-Act conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.365" offset="1485358">Rather, there is a purposeful post-Act practice of paying blacks less than whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.191" offset="1508659">On the second issue of the statistical proof of discrimination in the agent's salaries, we have shown in our brief that the statistics offered in this case were sufficient to meet the plaintiff's burden of showing purposeful discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.242" offset="2388881">With respect to the desegregation of the 4H and Extension Homemaker Clubs, the main point that we wish to make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.192" offset="2420646">This Court has never held that the traditional free choice of non-state actors must be eliminated before a system can be found to be desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.017" offset="2459934">Even in Green versus the School Board in the school desegregation context, the Court explicitly left open the prospect that a free choice plan might sometimes be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.855" offset="2507268">The Court held that the free choice plan in the context of that case was, however, a contrived way of doing business with no legitimate rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.132" offset="2548437">In contrast here the norm, the normal way of operating these 4H clubs is by an open membership system.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.738" offset="2582814">It is further important to understand here that the District Court has found no discrimination in services or membership with respect to the clubs as of the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.593" offset="2630253">Indeed, the Court expressly found that any racial imbalance existing among clubs was the product of exclusively and wholly voluntary choice of private individuals, that is, of non-state actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.290" offset="2697022">The private petitioners argue that freedom of choice with respect to club membership has not been the norm in the 4E system because whites were required to attend white clubs and blacks were required to attend black clubs, but that misperceives how one determines what the norm would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.031" offset="2783957">In any de jure segregated system there is assignment on the basis of race during the de jure period, but the issue is, what happens with respect to, say, whites among whites and blacks among blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.681" offset="2842576">Thus, in a situation with respect to, say, parks or seats on a bus or indeed colleges, the norm is a free choice admission program, and in those situations we believe that disestablishment certainly can be found even though free choice has been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.359" offset="2945289">I have nothing further unless the Court has any further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.192" offset="3040584">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address my comments first to the second issue in our petition, the statistical evidence problem, and I would like to begin by responding to the questions that Justice Rehnquist and Justice White asked of my colleague regarding the nature of the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.214" offset="3132744">It is our contention that the issue here is an entirely legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.867" offset="3151343">The Court of Appeals and the District Court have somewhat different theories, and the legal issues that they raise are therefore distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.287" offset="3181018">In the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals held that statistical proof was in its words "unacceptable as evidence of discrimination",</text>
            <text syncTime="768.502" offset="3217903">"and that was as a matter of law, unless, and again I quote. "</text>

            <text syncTime="776.811" offset="3251131">In other words, in a case where there was evidence, as here, that blacks and whites in the same job were getting different salaries, and further evidence that that couldn't be explained by differences in experience or education of job performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.588" offset="3302227">In the Court of Appeals view, as a matter of law, that evidence was simply insignificant, and the District Court could not have made a finding of discrimination on it even if it had wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.380" offset="3337335">On the contrary, on the Court of Appeals' view, this case should have been dismissed--</text>

            <text syncTime="856.639" offset="3570452">On the District Court's view, a defendant can rebut proof of salary discrimination merely by offering evidence that additional factors go into its salary determinations which were not included in its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.367" offset="3625309">The District Court clearly held, and I think this is inconsistent with this Court's previous decisions, that a defendant is under no obligation to adjure any evidence that those factors in any way correlated with race.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.539" offset="3778073">The District Court's view was that if plaintiff was required to do more than show that there were differences in the average salaries of blacks and whites even when controlled for education and a number of other factors, the District Court's view was that we had to control for everything, and even for a number of issues which the District Court frankly said it was impossible to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.812" offset="3855082">If that is the standard, it simply would be impossible to use statistical evidence under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.561" offset="3878070">This isn't a case in the District Court in which the District Court said, look, given how much you did do, and given the evidence on the other side, on balance I am persuaded that there was no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.977" offset="3927807">This is a case in which the District Court said simply the fact that the defendant can think up something else that you might have done in your statistics, even though there is no claim that it would have changed the result, that is dispositive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.791" offset="4995066">Initially the plaintiffs made clear that they had evidence that the average salaries of blacks and whites in the same job were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.803" offset="5023069">The defendant undertook to meet what we all understood to be the defendant's burden, that is, to come forward with evidence which tended to show that some legitimate non-racial factor could have explained it, and they retained a statistician, and they said, look, we think there are three factors which would explain why blacks earn less than whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.108" offset="5100287">We think it is job experience, we think it is education, and we think it is sex, and they said, go recalculate the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.355" offset="5125260">We believe it is going to show that when you take those three things into account there is no disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.057" offset="5140098">Well, the statistician did exactly the calculation that I think Dothard and Hazelwood and all this Court's cases require and came back and said, you are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.414" offset="5173534">The evidence in fact is that when you look at these factors it doesn't eliminate disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.692" offset="5194641">Indeed, in some cases it increases the disparity... through the defendants, rather than attempting once again to offer evidence of a factor that might have explained away the discrimination of the differences in salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.375" offset="5245319">The defendants took a completely different attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.063" offset="5252111">They said, well, we can think of nine other factors that might have explained this, but we aren't going to show you any evidence that in fact it did explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.027" offset="5283980">We are, for example, to focus on the issue of particular importance to the Court of Appeals, but also emphasized in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.555" offset="5314073">The defendants argued, it is possible that the reason blacks earn less than whites is because blacks are concentrated in the poor paying counties in the state, and the District Court said, well, since that is a possibility, the plaintiffs are going to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.300" offset="5365064">Defendants never introduced any evidence that blacks were in fact concentrated in the poorer counties in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.563" offset="5386067">Indeed, the evidence is quite clearly to the contrary, but it was the District Court's view and the Court of Appeals' view that the fact that some other factor which never had been dealt with, hadn't been dealt with, hadn't been dealt with, was dispositive in and of itself, without regard to there being any evidence or any claim that that factor had an explanatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.837" offset="5455239">To take a simpler example closer to the original facts in McDonnell-Douglas against Green, imagine a case in which a plaintiff introduced evidence according to McDonnell-Douglas that she had applied for a job as a teacher, that she was qualified, that she had been turned down, and that the defendants had then gone on to fill the job with a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.893" offset="5535487">That would clearly lead to the plaintiff's initial burden under McDonnell-Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.251" offset="5548862">What the defendants did in this case was to offer a defense limited to the following evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.030" offset="5571954">We prefer people who specialize in romance languages, but no evidence that the plaintiff individual didn't in fact herself specialize in romance languages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.525" offset="5613959">As we understand McDonnell-Douglas, the minimal amount of evidence require to rebut a prima facie case is not only that there is a racially neutral policy, but that the racially neutral policy had explanatory power, that it indeed could have accounted for the disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.332" offset="5669234">That is precisely what the defendants very deliberately did not attempt to show here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.846" offset="5687206">And at least in a number of these instances the reason they didn't attempt to show it is clear, because the evidence was quite the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.168" offset="5896499">Their standard hinges on the distinction between major variables and additional variables, and depending on whether a variable is major or additional, the plaintiff or the defendant has to adduce the relevant evidence, and cases will be won or lost depending on how a court classifies the variable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.474" offset="5957730">We think that the teaching of Akins is that the Court should not use that sort of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.691" offset="5978628">We think the various factors identified by the government ought to be considered by a lower court or by this Court in weighing evidence of statistics, but that the Court should not try to formulate a mechanical standard as to just precisely what has to be in a plaintiff's prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.325" offset="6049159">We don't think that the government standard is particularly workable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.348" offset="6281231">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this morning I feel like I am watching my own autopsy, because as the lawyer who tried the case, working 14 hours a day, day and night, weekends, and being in that courtroom, I am not hearing the same case that we tried in 1981 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.976" offset="6403797">All we are hearing are legal theories that are not related to the facts that the trial judge, Frank Dupree, found after hearing all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.424" offset="6453534">There is one thing about this case, Members of the Court, that we have hammered all the way through, and it is the truth, and it is the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.389" offset="6497420">North Carolina is a state of 100 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.997" offset="6507869">The Extension Service has a branch in each one of those counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.449" offset="6525632">That is indisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.668" offset="6534514">It is uncontroverted, and it is in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.215" offset="6544754">The facts in this case dealing with salary, which the petitioners and the government as so interested in, go to the salaries of individual agents in each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.162" offset="6608493">The biggest fallacy that you will hear and read in their briefs and hear in rebuttal is that it is the same job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.126" offset="6640362">It is not the same job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.656" offset="6654468">It is not a similar job situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.000" offset="6663872">The record shows, take, for example, the record which showed that an agent in the mountains of North Carolina, where there is no golden leaf tobacco, where there are poor people, where they scratch a living out in the soil, where the county tax base is poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.866" offset="6739314">The evidence shows that that agent who goes out and teaches the farmers, because that is what an extension agent does, they are teachers, but they teach to an unstructured group, when they go out and teach to the farmers in that county, those people are hired because they are trained and educated in truck farming or apple growing or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.623" offset="6838370">When you go to North Carolina's tobacco belt in the big counties down there, they want agents that are trained in tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.947" offset="6875673">They want them that are trained in soybeans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.181" offset="6884555">When you go to Charlotte and those areas of the state, Union County, where Mr. Bazemore is from, where they have livestock, they want an agent like Mr. Bazemore, who is trained and knew about pig farming, and knew about animal husbandry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.018" offset="6943905">It is this type of employment that we are talking about that requires special qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.313" offset="6973162">It is not blue collar work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.108" offset="6980267">They are college-educated, and most of them have master's degrees, and each one of them are hired in their particular county based upon the needs of that particular county and their educational background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.493" offset="7029796">It is just like hiring a tax specialist to come to work in a law firm, or a litigation specialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.898" offset="7055500">It depends on what the needs of each of the 100 counties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.240" offset="7068875">Now, we are not going to... one other thing I would say, that much, that is the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.252" offset="7100849">If you look at the facts, you will see that the jobs are not similar, and once you understand that principle, their arguments are bouncing off the beautiful walls in here, because Judge Dupree and we knew it, and we told him that those are what the facts are, and they just have disregarded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.793" offset="7175036">They disregarded it this morning in their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.026" offset="7187993">They disregarded it in their briefs, because we are not dealing with similar jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.679" offset="7206592">The way their statistical case and their case fell apart is that they didn't take this into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.206" offset="7240656">They came in and Judge Dupree let in all one evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.924" offset="7255598">He didn't keep anything out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.783" offset="7263017">All the statistical regressions, all of these averages that everybody put in comparing black and white, all of this came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.671" offset="7298543">But they didn't take into account that you can't compare the agent in Ash County, North Carolina, a poor county in North Carolina who is doing apples, and who is teaching people in Appalachia how to truck farm more effectively, you can't compare his job or the economic conditions in which he is paid with that of the chief tobacco agent in Wilson County, North Carolina, where the tobacco crop brings in millions of dollars a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.164" offset="8132476">Those are the three... four sources of funding from the time you start.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.108" offset="8680316">But the next point that I would make in connection with that and in answer to that as to whether that continued in salaries or not is to look at the chart which we attached to the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.696" offset="8742697">If that theory was true, and it continued, and we say it did not, then there would be a market, and this is Appendix Exhibit A, there would be... the pre-'65 blacks and the pre-'65 whites would be spread like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.408" offset="8805495">If you will take a look at that chart, which is everybody who was there in 1965 and there in '72, you will find all over the board, from the bottom to the top, whites and blacks are dispersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.903" offset="8859516">There were 42 black agents who were there and there were 65 white agents there, and if you will take a look at it, you will see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.557" offset="8890132">The point I am making is that from 1965, when the law took effect, the Extension Service, and both courts so found, operated on a non-discriminatory basis, and that is what Judge Dupree found as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.426" offset="8949587">He did not find a prima facie case on the evidence that came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.345" offset="8969231">Judge Dupree said that a careful weighing and assessment of the plaintiff's statistical and non-statistical evidence led the court to conclude that the plaintiffs had probably made out a prima facie case with respect to defendants' promotion and salary practice, and the analysis of the court proceeded on this assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.572" offset="9042165">While not conceding that the plaintiffs have made a prima facie case, the defendant Extension Service assumed the burden, which we did, of articulating plausible reasons for its action, and its evidence, which the court, the trial court found convincing, has been set forth therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.598" offset="9106217">The plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence that our reasons, defendants' reasons were protectual, and their case failed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.647" offset="9230455">They were doing the same analysis on where the money comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.256" offset="9248845">If you will read that portion of their opinion, what they were saying was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.849" offset="9263265">There can be no discrimination in across-the-board wages that the state gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.691" offset="9282596">There was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.269" offset="9284894">There was none in the county across-the-board wages, which is the way most employees in government service get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.735" offset="9310808">The only two places that there could have possibly been any discrimination, and what they were saying in i.e., what Justice White had said, a lingering effect of what was there, salaries of pre-'65 hires who were there in '72, and then they said the other one is the performance or the merit pay system, which is the quartile system, which we use because our employees don't do the same jobs, and they said it in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.300" offset="9441107">They then said that they did not feel that under Evans or under Hazelwood, that under those conditions, that those, if there were lingering effects, that they were presently actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.871" offset="9499307">I personally would agree with that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.511" offset="9517907">I don't know how the Court is going to agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.947" offset="9523654">I would say seven years later that that is how they... that is the context in which they discussed it, which leads into our point that we have tried to make and Judge Dupree saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.366" offset="9565345">The manner in which our agents are paid comes from a system which... and not appeal, and not before this Court, which is found to be in all facets, in hiring, in promotion, in in-house education, to be non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.156" offset="9636502">The Extension Service, members of the Court, if you read in this entire opinion, and what they didn't appeal from was found to be non-discriminatory completely in its employment practices and when you look at the... going to the variable question that Mr. Schnapper was talking about a minute ago, that these were imaginary things that Judge Dupree rejected, what I have just told you is hardly imaginary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.005" offset="9751859">It is in evidence, and it is the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.347" offset="9757293">Those were not included in their statistical case, nor did they ever take them into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.627" offset="9778400">The other thing that I think which shows the Court immediately that what we are saying about our services, it is not uniform from county to county, is the extension chairmen's salaries, all of whom are the head person in the county, and that is found in the joint appendix on Page 165 for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.056" offset="9868052">The range in salaries of the top person in that county is between $2,000 and $5,000 a year, and everybody under him or her is going to be... is not going to be paid any more regardless of what kind of job they do or regardless of their specialty, and this is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.703" offset="9946628">North Carolina's situation is not a factory setting, like a wiget factory, nor is it everybody examining tax forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.479" offset="9997828">The other thing that is different, that is a major factor that Judge Dupree pointed out in balancing the regression and not swallowing all of these comparisons that everybody put forth to him, were that the county salaries, percentage of state and county, varied with each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.206" offset="10080689">For example, if Justice White and I started out at the same time out of law school or out of the agent school with the same degree, and we both got a salary of $10,000 a year to start, and he went into a county that had a 70 percent county... state supplement of his salary, and mine was 40, and that example is in our brief, at the end of the first year, if he got a 5 percent state raise, he would have gotten a $350 raise, I would have gotten a $200 raise, and that happens every year in 100 counties, and affects all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.489" offset="10233871">It has nothing to do with race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.738" offset="10238782">That is what Judge Dupree and the trial court saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.299" offset="10253097">Now, moving to the question which is one of the issues raised this morning, is that the county extension chairmanships, and this goes to the head person in the county, and I just briefly would say, because it hasn't been argued, but I want to make the point that both courts were correct there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.007" offset="10343898">There were 23 individual cases on that issue, five futility applicants and 18 actual black plaintiffs who were present in court, whose cases were put on very ably by Mr. Reblin, who is here this morning, put on very ably, and we answered every charge, and Judge Dupree in his opinion on the individual claims found that we had offered a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for each and every single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.759" offset="10486945">That is a factual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.679" offset="10494573">He decided it on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.413" offset="10501469">It was not found to be erroneous by the Court of Appeals, and these arguments about General Telephone and these other cases, they shouldn't be here, because that case was decided on the facts, and nobody has said that Judge Dupree is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.063" offset="10568134">With respect to the club issue, there is one, Members of the Court, that is astounding to hear what I have heard this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.779" offset="10610974">The Extension Service, as Justice White pointed out, was in fact segregated prior to 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.992" offset="10647859">At the end of 1965, and when it came into effect, they set about to integrate that service and its programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.317" offset="10685162">The 4H Clubs and the Homemaker Extension Clubs are viable, educational, voluntary groups run by volunteers and assisted by extension workers in every single county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.608" offset="10746289">Mr. Schnapper's brief asserts that there was intentional discrimination in recruitment, and the government pointed out in their brief there is no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.369" offset="10793309">We tried this case for ten weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.509" offset="10805952">If you look at the fact that extension programs like this are not static, and the membership changes all the time, we have run through 100,000 kids a year and volunteers in that program since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.314" offset="10869169">Among those, 40,000 or whatever the numbers show are black, black male and female volunteers that come to those clubs, who organize those clubs, and black children and white children, and if you look at our figures, we integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.948" offset="10939699">The one thing that the plaintiffs never brought forward out of the hundreds of thousands of participants in North Carolina, male, female, and those who were children in '65 who are adults now, was that there was any evidence that they were ever rejected from membership in a club, that they ever felt the least discrimination in engaging in programs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3320.416" offset="13425511">We are in pretty much agreement with the government that there really aren't factual findings with regard to the 4H Club issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.051" offset="13460098">I would like to just briefly respond to some factual questions the Court raised about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.722" offset="13474726">First, with regard to the size of the state involvement in this club, there was testimony at Page 4,956 of the transcript that the equivalent of 122 full-time state employees worked on 4H and Extension Homemaker matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.357" offset="13537316">Secondly, at Page 5,069, there is testimony that the budget for these activities totals approximately $5 million on a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.119" offset="13576290">With regard to efforts to assure that new 4H Club and Extension Homemaker Clubs are integrated, Mr. Manning said that there was indeed such an effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.488" offset="13621848">I believe that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.410" offset="13629476">If you look at Page 1,823 of the Court of Appeals transcript, you will see an express proposal to require that when someone comes in with a new club in an integrated community and the club is all black or all white, that the organizer be directed to go out and try to recruit members of the other race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.247" offset="13692901">If you look at Page 1,827, you will note it says deleted from the 1974 Civil Rights Initiatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.260" offset="13720904">That proposal was deliberately and expressly rejected by the service, and they have expressly decided not to do exactly what the court asked if they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.973" offset="13763745">There is indeed, as I think Mr. Justice Blackmun inquired, have been an increase in the number of single race club in mixed communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.532" offset="13801988">If you look at Pages 103 and 134 of the joint appendix, you will that the total number of single race clubs in integrated communities has indeed gone up from year to year since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.200" offset="13856636">We agree with the government that the recruiting--</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.870" offset="13871369">May I just interrupt there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.370" offset="13873355">Hasn't the percentage gone the other way?</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.916" offset="13883490">--The percentage... well, with regard to the 4H Clubs, the percentage has gone down only because the number of integrated clubs has gone up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.726" offset="13910762">The number of segregated clubs--</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.959" offset="13919748">--That's right, but the number of single race clubs has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.660" offset="13930511">Well, it has gone down 2 percent in eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.348" offset="13937302">It was, I think, 890 and it is now 880.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3451.159" offset="13948483">But the trend, even though it was very modest, the trend was in the other direction, at least on a percentage basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="3457.235" stopTime="3492.595">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3457.235" offset="13972829">Well, that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.140" offset="13984427">I mean, we agree on what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.810" offset="13987144">With regard to the Extension Homemaker Clubs, there has been no such trend, well, to speak of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.699" offset="14010654">The latest data is 98 percent of all the Extension Homemaker Clubs in the state are either all black or all white.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.790" offset="14039076">There is something less than 200 blacks in the entire state that belong to a club that has a white member in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.460" offset="14061750">Now, I suppose technically that is progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.240" offset="14068855">They have made 2 percent in a number of years, and at that rate, I suppose, in a very, very long period of time there might be substantial progress, but I don't think that's the kind of progress that Mr. Justice Stevens had in mind when he asked the question.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3492.595" offset="14114204">You say there are only 200 blacks in integrated clubs in the whole state?</text>

          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="3497.734" stopTime="3584.558">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3497.734" offset="14134788">In the Extension Homemaker Clubs, the data is at Page... well, at Page 103 it says there are only 22 integrated clubs of about 1,800.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.523" offset="14213991">Later in the record at 107 it says the number of members of integrated... the number of non-white members of integrated clubs is in the right-hand column, about the middle of the page, is 197.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.313" offset="14273133">As I said, the government has suggested that we need to have a remand with regard to the recruiting problem because the lower courts simply failed to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.730" offset="14318795">The lower courts accepted the view that Mr. Manning has put forth today that the only obligation that the state had in this area was to assure that if a black actually found his way or her way to a club and applied, that he or she was not rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.178" offset="14376578">Because of that, the Court of Appeals and the lower courts simply thought there was no reason to decide whether there was discrimination in recruiting or to decide whether there were in fact continuing effects that date from the original de jure system, and there simply aren't findings on either of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.422" offset="14441570">We would ask the Court to sustain our views that there is such an obligation, and that discrimination in recruiting is illegal, and remand the case for appropriate relief.</text>
