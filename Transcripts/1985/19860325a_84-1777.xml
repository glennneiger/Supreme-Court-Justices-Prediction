            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="20.040" offset="223936">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.036" offset="255910">In this case, the UAW sued on behalf of its members to overturn a directive issued by the Secretary of Labor that resulted in denying trade readjustment allowance, or TRA benefits, to thousands of UAW members.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.263" offset="324768">The UAW requested the district court to decide a single federal question, whether the Secretary of Labor's interpretation of federal law was in error, and if so, to direct the Secretary through his agents to correct that error by reconsidering under a proper standard claims denied under the invalid directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.442" offset="413480">The district court agreed with us that the Secretary's directive in facted violated federal law, and that thousands of UAW members had in fact been illegally denied TRA benefits and granted the requested relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.358" offset="469173">On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals did not reach the merits of this controversy, nor did it reach any number of procedural defenses raised by the government, some for the first time in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.774" offset="522881">Instead, the Court of Appeals decided the case on an issue that had never previously been raised, principally on this issue, and that is whether the UAW had standing to litigate this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.769" offset="570842">It is this standing issue that we have brought to this Court on certiorari, principally, and that is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.173" offset="600412">If, as we believe it must, this Court reverses on that issue and decides that the UAW may in fact serve as the collective voice of its members in this litigation, then the other procedural issues would be opened on remand in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.808" offset="658927">What this says is that the issue before this Court is considerably simpler than the government's brief might suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.976" offset="695603">There is a standing issue, and the remainder of the issues are procedural issues opened on remand in the Court of Appeals, as the government's brief--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="144.722" offset="722665">Well, Ms. Berzon, you are speaking generally of what you call procedural issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.299" offset="744922">Is the question of whether this is a proper use of the declaratory judgment in this situation where Congress appears to have thought review should go through the state courts, is that what you call a procedural issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="163.716" offset="798630">That issue which the government is willing to assume in this case, that is, that we do have subject matter jurisdiction--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.448" offset="825483">Well, I don't know how you define subject matter jurisdiction, but at any rate, address yourself to the question I asked you.</text>

          <turn speaker="marsha_s_berzon" startTime="180.053" stopTime="297.474">
            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="180.053" offset="863936">--I think I am, and that is whether in fact there is review under federal question jurisdiction of federal questions concerning Trade Act benefits, or whether the Trade Act itself requires that all such questions be decided in state court, and our answer to that question is that what the Secretary of Labor keeps asserting, that there is something in the Trade Act that requires that the questions be decided in state court, there is simply no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.666" offset="978456">What the Trade Act says in Section 239(d) is that determinations with respect to eligibility for benefits are to be decided in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the state unemployment insurance law.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.189" offset="1060481">That language does not say that the review is to be in state court or under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.342" offset="1077095">Instead, it sets up a comparative standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.826" offset="1091096">If you look at the relevant body of comparative law, that is, state unemployment insurance law, one finds a long line of cases in this Court and in the lower federal courts, and one would expect to find such cases, in which there is ordinary federal question jurisdiction to decide federal issues with respect to those benefits, and in fact, if there is any doubt about this, this Court decided in... a year before this statute was passed with respect to precisely parallel language in 5 USC Section 8502(d) in Christian v. The Department of Labor of New York that there was federal jurisdiction in that case to decide a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.653" offset="1262355">Consequently, Congress has not created an anomaly such as is suggested by the government and sent off to state court issues with respect to a purely federal benefit program where all the money is federal, the administrative money is federal, this set of law that governs this case is federal.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.087" offset="1448138">--In this instance, the relief did, for reasons related both to the fact that the UAW was the plaintiff and I think took proper regard for the state system and for the administration of the district court, decide only the single federal question and remand all claims back to the administrative system.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.672" offset="1542388">But that's the same thing that would have happened had the case gone up in a state court, the state--</text>

            <text syncTime="353.483" offset="1557643">Yes, but what you're saying is that these players can split off one issue in the question of whether they are determined to get benefits, all the other issues going through a state court, and have the federal court decide that by a declaratory judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.378" offset="1669239">The Secretary of Labor in this case requires that the states follow its statutory interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.218" offset="1700585">In this instance, in fact, while... this is a particularly inappropriate case to be contending that we ought to have stayed in the state administrative system because what happened here is that while these claims were in fact pending before the appeals body in California, for example, the government wrote a letter directly to the Appeals Board, not to the agency in general, but to the Chairman of the Appeals Board, and told the Chairman of the Appeals Board that if the Appeals Board decided in favor of the claimants, that the, first, that the Federal Government would pay, second, that the state was going to have to pay out of its own funds, third, that the state's entire unemployment insurance system could be decertified with enormous tax consequences for the employers in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.104" offset="1904132">To say that under those circumstances we are to sit there and continue to deal with the state administrative system which has been completely biased by the Secretary of Labor asserting itself--</text>

            <text syncTime="798.895" offset="3339299">For example, in Duke Power Company, one of the litigants was a union.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.790" offset="3466881">For example, would the union have standing, in your view, to file a suit to secure Food Stamps for employees who are substandard in income or something like that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="873.522" offset="3637826">--I think it would depend on whether that could be construed as being within the purposes of that organization, as governed by its history and by its governing documents, and not by whether the name of the organization was union.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.218" offset="3704595">In this instance I think there is no doubt that these particular benefits were squarely within the union's purposes, and indeed, there is express authorization and indeed some measure of responsibility upon the union to represent members with respect to unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.898" offset="3775335">Indeed, the decision to act collectively here was one that came from the involvement of this union in the Trade Act for a while, from the fact that it was representing individuals throughout the country in obtaining benefits, and from the fact that it turned out that the single reason for denying benefits was recurring repeatedly, and when inquiry was made, we discovered that there was a directive from the Secretary of Labor that was in fact governing the benefits, and in addition, discovered that the biasing of the state administrative assistants were going on, and it was for that reason that the members of the UAW joined together to do something that none of them could have done on their own, and that was to bring a major federal lawsuit challenging the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.984" offset="3999674">This joining together to enhance the voice of individual members is within long political tradition and constitutional tradition of this country, and this is a perfect example of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.900" offset="4059338">Consequently, when the Court of Appeals held that the UAW did not have standing in this case, it was going against a long line of cases in this court summarized relatively recently by the Chief Justice for this Court in Hunt v. Washington State Advertising Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.112" offset="4136138">In Hunt, the Court stated three requirements for finding that there... an organization can in fact represent its members, and in this case, the conclusion that we were satisfying all three of those prongs of the Hunt inquiry is really relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.887" offset="4219312">First of all, the first requirement is that the individuals have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.023" offset="4239792">There is really no question here as to that if looked at as it properly should be as a standing inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.255" offset="4268736">There was direct injury to thousands of our members that were denied this money, and money is the most concrete sort of injury that one can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.111" offset="4304158">Similarly, only I think I covered the second germaneness requirement of Hunt in answer to Justice O'Connor's questions; and the third prong of Hunt, therefore, is the focus, it seems to us, of the Court of Appeals' concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.714" offset="4378554">That prong is whether there is any need for individual participation either with respect to the claim for relief or with respect to the belief itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.863" offset="4435188">And in this instance it seems that there were several things bothering the Court of Appeals, none of which have any validity as a reason why individual participation is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.704" offset="4478551">First of all, the Court mentioned that the relief granted might affect different members differentially, and that is, of course, true, but it is true not only in any organizational standing case but in any 23(b)(2) class action, and this Court expressly noted in Califano v. Yamasaki that it is one of the strengths of collective litigation of this kind that it is possible to focus only on the joint uniform problem and to leave the individual adjudications to an administrative system, which is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.375" offset="4621284">Similarly, the fact that monetary relief was involved is of no consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.404" offset="4645317">This Court in Schweiker v. Gray Panthers expressly recognized standing to obtain monetary relief, there in the form of future prospective benefits on behalf of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.369" offset="4693173">Similarly, the fact that the relief is in some sense retrospective in that it reopens old claims or it regards claims that have already once been decided is again not relevant to the standing inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.253" offset="4756703">It is not relevant to the standing inquiry because, as Warth noted, the basic question is whether or not the Court will have to determine any of the individual matters involved, and as Warth also noted, it would therefore even be possible to award retrospective damages if the damages could be equally divided or divided in some way that does not get the Court involved in the dividing up of the benefits, and that is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.992" offset="4867671">Finally, the government tries to support the Court's retrospectivity finding on the grounds of this Court's recent case of Green v. Mansour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.689" offset="4922528">Green v. Mansour, as its language confirms, is deeply imbedded in the Eleventh Amendment and has no viable existence outside of the Eleventh Amendment context here, there is no Eleventh Amendment consideration because we are dealing with purely federal funds, a purely federal program and purely federal defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.322" offset="5161079">The states were simply agents of the Secretary of Labor, as the statute says repeatedly, and the Secretary had full authority to grant the relief requested.</text>

Hodory, New York Telephone Company v. New York Department of Labor, and a slew of other cases, both in this Court and lower courts, have in fact adjudicated state unemployment insurance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.048" offset="5387926">It would make no sense for those cases to be able to go forward in federal court but for cases that deal with a solely federal program not to be able to go forward in federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.847" offset="5835142">The principal issue in this case, of course, is whether Petitioner United Auto Workers has standing to bring the suit and to seek the relief requested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.078" offset="5876102">But because this Court has inquired about Christian and because the Petitioners make so much of that case, perhaps I should first explain that Christian does not hold that the sort of claim splitting that was done here can be undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.133" offset="5948305">Christian first of all is a classic collateral order type of case within the meaning of Mathews v. Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.333" offset="5985085">The principle at issue there had to do with procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.314" offset="6000968">More than that, it didn't just have to do with state procedure, it had to do with a procedure that the federal agency would have to go through with respect to redetermination or reasons why persons were tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.403" offset="6069304">Wasn't Christian a mandamus?</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl</label>
            <text syncTime="1484.090" offset="6080066">That's another basis for distinguishing it, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.212" offset="6092605">The question... the jurisdictional question that was raised there and is articulated in that case and discussed is whether mandamus jurisdiction is available with respect to a suit against a federal officer, not on the basis of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.910" offset="6151328">Furthermore, in that case the Court also suggested on remand that the Court might want to hold the case open and let the state administrative process go forward to further ripen the suit, so that for all those reasons we don't believe that Christian, et al. is some kind of a sweeping holding that under 239(d) cases issues can be plucked out of state proceedings and taken into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.928" offset="6279433">Because the United Auto Workers has alleged no injury to itself as an organization here, it must satisfy the requirements for representative standing that are set forth in Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.890" offset="6347351">In our argument we show, first, that the Petitioner has not satisfied the Hunt requirements, and in the alternative, we suggest that the Hunt test does not really fully address the concerns raised by the standing issue in the context of this case, and that the Court might wish to look to class action principles to inform its representative standing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.535" offset="6441914">As has been stated, returning to Hunt, the Hunt test has three parts: first, whether members would be able to sue in their own right; second, whether the interests that the union seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and third, whether the claim asserted and the relief requested require the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.447" offset="6545568">And we have argued that the Petitioners have not satisfied any of the three prongs of Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.851" offset="6567093">Turning to the first prong of Hunt, then, whether members can sue in their own right, we have shown in our brief that no member would have been able to bring an action similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.314" offset="6621010">Petitioners' primary argument in rebuttal is that we have gone too far in asking that someone actually be able to come into court and bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.341" offset="6669075">They say that it should be enough that some member show injury to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.400" offset="6693317">But actually, the Petitioners' own assertions in their brief disprove their argument because in their reply brief they have disclaimed any desire to represent those persons who went through the state administrative process and then went to state court and were denied benefits in state court and say we have no desire to represent those people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.453" offset="6789552">That certainly suggests to us that they are admitting that something more than just injury is required under the Warth test, and that Warth really looks to whether someone could bring a justiciable case... and those are... that is the language of Warth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.853" offset="6855172">It requires that a justiciable case be able to be identified with respect to a union member.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.226" offset="7032595">It requires that someone, there actually be some member who could come into court and bring suit, and we have actually narrowed it down now to two groups of people that the Petitioners suggest among their members would be able to come into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.753" offset="7086721">First, they suggest that members who pursued their claim through the state administrative process but did not go to court would be able to come in, and secondly, they suggest that members who began but did not complete the state administrative process would be able to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.792" offset="7158923">But both those groups include persons, first, who would be estopped by administrative collateral, collateral estoppel, because they would have let their... they would have intentionally abandoned their claims, having gone to the administrative process, they would have dropped out at some stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.133" offset="7944269">But the Court granted certiorari in this case on the issue of standing, and therefore, we have briefed and argued this case in the context of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.972" offset="7995678">But our reading of this Court's cases is that when the first Hunt inquiry is made as to whether any individual would be able to come into court, that that goes beyond some sort of determination of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.436" offset="8057536">Warth itself looked to rather a member of the housing association, whether a member applied for a variance and had a ripe claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.399" offset="8101317">One member of the association had applied for a variance at one tie, but his claim was stale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.177" offset="8132455">So we read Warth and Hunt as requiring something more than that there be a member there with injury, but rather, that there be something who can be pointed to who would be able to come into court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.479" offset="9169621">Turning then to the second prong of the hunt test, whether the interests that the union seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purposes, the petitioner states in its reply brief that the Secretary and this Court may not define for the union what its purposes are, but that assertion on their part seems to run contrary to the second, what is required by the second prong of the Hunt test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.014" offset="9287799">Moreover, the... I think that it is quite unclear, certainly unclear from the complaint in this case, as opposed to the UAW constitution which has come in only in the reply brief, that union members would have expected the union to be bringing this kind of action on their behalf, and Congress in particular, I believe that the congressional scheme should inform this germaneness inquiry because Congress has explicitly provided for union standing to seek certification, to seek the certification of groups of workers as part of the earlier stages of this trade reallowance or readjustment allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.900" offset="9487374">But Congress has created quite an individual process for the part where workers go into the state administrative process to actually get their money, so that under Block v. Community Nutrition Institute where Congress has set up a detailed mechanism for review at the behest of a particular group of persons, in this case, the workers applying themselves, it may be found that review by others is impliedly concluded, and that the union should not be able to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.633" offset="9658319">The third prong of the Hunt test, of course, asks whether individual members of the association must participate in order to provide the relief requested, and as I think was clear from the questions that Justice O'Connor was asking of Petitioners' counsel, it is quite an individual process that is going to be required here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.764" offset="11606845">We also think that there is a benefit to litigants generally to having litigation conducted in a way that assures some adequacy of representation with regard to different groups whose interests are at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.396" offset="12017281">Well, what should have happened is that individual members should have moved for class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.580" offset="12038074">If that had been done, it is our contention that the Court would have been required to focus early on, as happens in some of these Social Security cases that come to you, on the different subjects that people should have exhausted, the people who got to the end of the process and have res judicata effect with regard to their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.525" offset="12121875">Now, we think we would have prevailed as to all of those subgroups, and we also would have made our jurisdictional argument, but as the litigation proceeded, at leas you would have known which people the district court would have certified, which it had dropped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.845" offset="12183106">If it had blocked out various groups for a particular reason, a representative of that groups could have intervened and sought to appeal the denial of certification as to that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.686" offset="12230440">So, you know, we don't feel that this is a particularly parochial argument we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.043" offset="12251861">We have looked at this problem as it is has evolved in this case, and we think that the class certification procedures really have a lot to offer in dealing with cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.414" offset="12297418">There's also another anomaly that I think the Petitioners' brief points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.349" offset="12321137">As I mentioned earlier, they seemed to chafe at the second prong of the Hunt test of a judicial inquiry into the appropriate purposes of an organization, and there's something to their discomfort with that because the organization should be able to define its own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.011" offset="12415805">If a class action procedure were used, however, you wouldn't have a judicial inquiry into the organization's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.164" offset="12452376">What you would have is a complaint by an individual which sets for the issues that they plead and that they wish to present to the Court, and then a comparison can be made with regard to other persons in the universe and the extent to which their interests share in the interests that are asserted in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.623" offset="12542238">It doesn't require a sort of a going into, as I say, judicial inquiry into the organization's proper purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.886" offset="12579332">And in closing, I might just say that I think what we are proposing here is not a particularly radical concept nor one that would disadvantage to any particularly great extent litigants, organizational litigants because it would only require that they can't litigate, that they can't have their name as the plaintiff in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.046" offset="12683926">They would have to join an individual member, they would have to go through the class certification process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.014" offset="12707750">If the interests are very cohesive in the organization, it may well be able to be a (b)(2) class, and then there's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.913" offset="12771384">--Well, Justice O'Connor, I'm not sure that it's substantially more burdensome because they still have to make the showing which may turn into a factual showing with regard to the three-pronged Hunt inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.455" offset="12817568">The notice requirement, if there is one, may not be in the (b)(2) class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.188" offset="12832510">It is a (b)(3) class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.719" offset="12838571">The notice requirement may be able to be met quite easily by an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.530" offset="12857901">In fact, in this case the union says that it used its magazine, Solidarity, to let its members know about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.605" offset="12894159">An organization might well have routine ways of communicating with its members, and that might be utilized by the court to lessen any burdens of a class notice procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.675" offset="12966466">So I really don't believe that what we are arguing here is that burdensome or that radical, but rather, a refinement of what Hunt searches for but perhaps doesn't quite get to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.725" offset="13078688">I think I might clarify some of the subject matter jurisdiction questions in this case, to look at the way an actual unemployment insurance cases raising similar issues can proceed, and in fact has proceeded in this case, in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.970" offset="13147652">In Hornry v. Ohio Security, Employment Security Division, the situation was basically the same as what it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.730" offset="13186626">A group of employees were denied unemployment insurance benefits based on a state statute which they claimed violated federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.961" offset="13227586">They took that claim in a class action into federal court and they obtained from the district court, which this Court reversed, an adjudication of the substitute federal issue, if they had one, and the order of the district court was precisely again what it was here, and that was to send the claims for reprocessing under a proper federal standard to the state agencies from whence they had come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.901" offset="13355377">There are, in addition, lots of similar cases, both in the unemployment insurance field and in other government benefit programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.663" offset="13394352">In the lower federal courts there have been welfare cases in this Court, there have been food stamp cases in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.175" offset="13428416">Indeed, the reason where there is not retrospective relief in this point in the bulk of benefit programs is that most of them, unlike this one, are cooperative state/federal programs which operate with state funds under state law, and under Edelman v. Jordan and its progeny, there is, because of Eleventh Amendment reasons and not for any other reason, an inability to grant retrospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.035" offset="13571880">But on the arguments that the government is making here today there would have been no federal jurisdiction over those cases whatever aside from the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.859" offset="13615139">The Eleventh Amendment would have been irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.265" offset="13620781">Edelman v. Jordan would never have had to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.780" offset="13630812">In addition, this Court in Migra v. Warren City School District has now decided that state actions covering 1983 matters are res judicata in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.867" offset="13703224">What that means is that if these individuals had done what they were invited to do and go back to tens of thousands of individual state court proceedings instead of this single federal case to litigate their federal issues, they never would have gotten to the federal courts on their federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.327" offset="13777098">You would have had 70,000 separate state court determinations that would--</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.304" offset="13856928">--No, I'm suggesting that it is at least unlikely, in light of this long line of federal cases treating other government benefit programs in exactly this way that I am describing, that Congress in 1974, when writing 239(d) of the Trade Act in some very inefficient and inarticulate way, because the language does not say this, intended to set that requirement to set up a situation in which the only recourse in a purely federal benefit program is the chance of this court with your certiorari, and also to set up the situation in which 70,000 separate claims have to be litigated in order rather than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.647" offset="14010319">At least it is both inefficient and unlikely, and the language just simply won't support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.208" offset="14028605">With respect to the state joinder on related issues, Wycoff has been cited, which was a ripeness case and one in which there as no injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.671" offset="14086388">Here we have injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.247" offset="14096732">We have a situation in which the states are operating solely as the state agents... as the federal agents, federal government's agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.697" offset="14130483">They are, of course, bound by the federal court decision, just as any agent would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.336" offset="14149082">To say that the states have to be sued is equivalent to saying that the clerk in the benefits office of the Secretary of Labor would have to be sued in a... or there was no relief against, no effective relief, and no finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.705" offset="14206551">That simply isn't the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.814" offset="14211044">And the Secretary of Labor, moreover, has efficient resources within this administrative scheme to assure that the states conform to any order that he gives them pursuant to this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.232" offset="14256706">Finally, the two main arguments on the standing question that the government makes, first of all, attempt to import all manner, not of this jurisdictional question but strictly procedural questions into the standing inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.709" offset="14326610">I think this case shows why that's inappropriate because one ends up with nonjurisdictional issues that have never been adjudicated below popping up for the first time in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court and being called a standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.547" offset="14377914">They haven't been explored below, and they should not be explored now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.389" offset="14389304">Finally, the suggestion has been made that somehow there are members, there are people dropping quit of this lawsuit or we are refusing to represent people we said we were representing and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.807" offset="14438936">The Complaint in this case says that we are suing on behalf of UAW's members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.852" offset="14455132">The relief granted was conceivably broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.632" offset="14470283">The government did not object to that relief either before it was granted or by a petition for reconsideration in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.612" offset="14506228">Perhaps it was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.502" offset="14513751">More likely, the government would just as soon grant relief to everyone as to go through and figure out who the UAW members were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.514" offset="14541754">But that really gets to problem of structure of this lawsuit.</text>
