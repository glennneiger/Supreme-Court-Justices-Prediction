            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="63.912" offset="402056">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.252" offset="431418">The question presented by our petition is whether under the Fourth Amendment respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a fishing boat, the Sea Otter, and thus was entitled to challenge the search of the boat as the basis for seeking the suppression of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.840" offset="489827">The District Court held that respondent had no such standing to move for suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="507695">On respondent's appeal pursuant to a conditional guilty plea that reserved the issue of his standing to challenge the cert, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and held that respondent did have an expectation of privacy in the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.942" offset="566210">Now, the facts relevant to this issue are set forth in the government's submission in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.283" offset="591601">Although respondent is the proponent of the motion, had the burden of proof on the issue of his privacy interest, he neither made a factual presentation of his own in the District Court nor contested the government's factual statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.872" offset="637890">In 1978, respondent solicited one George Mayberry Hunt to participate in a drug smuggling scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.557" offset="672685">Pursuant to that plan, respondent was to purchase a boat that Hunt and his crew would use to transport marijuana from Colombia, South America, to respondent's ranch on the coast of northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.019" offset="726497">After delivering the marijuana, Hunt and the crew were to take the boat and go to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.471" offset="748335">Pursuant to that plan, respondent thereafter purchased the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.171" offset="767143">In the spring of 1979, respondent turned over the Sea Otter to a crew that had been recruited by Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.200" offset="799222">The crew sailed to Mexico to meet Hunt, and then on to Columbia to pick up the cargo of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.400" offset="823986">The Sea Otter then returned to California and delivered the marijuana to respondent's ranch in June of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.319" offset="855646">Following delivery of the marijuana, Hunt and the crew started to sail the Sea Otter southward, but were delayed by bad weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.690" offset="885217">At that point, California fish and game officials boarded the Sea Otter because of suspected illegal fishing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.563" offset="912698">The state officials saw things that led them to believe the Sea Otter had been engaged in marijuana smuggling, and they so notified the federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.325" offset="947702">Coast Guard and Customs officers then went aboard the Sea Otter and found a number of suspicious circumstances, including admitted violations of Customs and Immigration requirements, a lack of documentation for the vessel, and evidence that two large rafts had recently been used, even though Hunt and the crew denied that they had been ashore.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.083" offset="1026801">The Sea Otter was placed under seizure, and escorted to a nearby Coast Guard station where its cargo holds were pumped out and marijuana residue was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.453" offset="1068283">No formal charges were brought against Hunt and the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.608" offset="1080822">Hunt remained in the San Francisco area for approximately nine months while the Sea Otter underwent repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.185" offset="1103183">He then took the boat to Costa Rica and used it for commercial fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.042" offset="1118543">Hunt turned over the Sea Otter to respondent in Costa Rica in November, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.274" offset="1139545">Now, our submission here is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.165" offset="1151039">Respondent did not have an expectation of privacy in the Sea Otter, and therefore the search of the boat did not implicate any Fourth Amendment right of his.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.020" offset="1186461">Mr. Levy, the respondent, of course, has changed the whole attack now that he is in this Court, and says, well, the real problem is the seizure of the boat and possibly the seizure of the marijuana revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.027" offset="1262530">It is no longer a challenge to the search as such, and I wonder whether the respondent... whether you think the respondent can properly raise those issues here.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.161" offset="1327104">We have addressed that issue in the reply brief, and in our reply brief we have traced the course of this litigation in considerable detail, and that discussion demonstrates that the entire focus of this case is on respondent's standing to challenge the search of the Sea Otter, not the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.843" offset="1389798">The seizure issue is not raised in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.029" offset="1402546">It was not preserved in the conditional guilty plea, and it was not submitted to or decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.788" offset="1461583">We have quoted it in our reply brief, and it is set out in the joint appendix, and the traditional guilty plea is at Page 21 of the joint appendix, and it says there, enters a conditional guilty plea, an order to preserve his right to appeal the District Court's decision that he had no standing to contest the search of the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.559" offset="1564610">The defendant's appeal will be limited to that one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.573" offset="1576730">As I say, we discussed all this in considerable detail in our reply brief, and we think that the entire course of the proceedings--</text>

            <text syncTime="363.851" offset="1601808">Well, I suppose his argument is that there is no right to search, because the search was the product of the illegal seizure, so that is the concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.707" offset="1645276">--That may be an argument that would have been open to him in the District Court, but it is certainly a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.987" offset="1662412">A challenge to the seizure is certainly a different argument from a challenge to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.189" offset="1675160">The seizure argument was not raised or preserved below, either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals, and we don't think it is properly presented here as an alternative ground.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="400.541" offset="1748616">Let me return to the search issue, since that is the issue that the Court of Appeals decided and the question presented in our certiorari petition, and one that we think warrants the consideration of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.520" offset="1792502">Now, let me begin with the recognition that this area of the law does not generally lend itself to hard and fast legal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.564" offset="1824685">Inherently, the concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy will frequently depend on all the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.357" offset="1855823">Close questions involving shades of gray rather than black and white differences will frequently be presented, and bright lines and categorical distinctions will sometimes be difficult to draw, but there are principles that guide that resolution of the privacy issue, and it is important for this Court to make clear the legal significance and proper application of those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.458" offset="1944221">The decision below establishes a Fourth Amendment standard that rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of those guiding principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.954" offset="1978285">Now, in this case, respondent from the very outset had no expectation of privacy in the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.202" offset="1999183">Our position is not so much as respondent characterizes in his brief that he abandoned the privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.388" offset="2023947">Rather, it is that respondent had no privacy interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.402" offset="2040038">First, respondent never personally used the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.307" offset="2051636">For example, he never maintained living quarters on the boat, but kept his personal effects there.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.445" offset="2072221">On the contrary, he specifically purchased the boat for the purpose of having others use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.692" offset="2093223">In addition, respondent had turned over custody and control of the Sea Otter to Hunt for a period of some two months at the time the search occurred, and respondent also contemplated that Hunt would retain the boat for an extended, indefinite period thereafter, which in fact proved to be more than two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.326" offset="2167725">Nor did respondent take any steps to preserve the privacy interest in the Sea Otter that he now asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.012" offset="2194474">In these circumstances where respondent did nothing that would give rise to an expectation of privacy and relinquish control over the Sea Otter for a considerable length of time, he had no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the boat.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="542.030" offset="2314533">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before the luncheon recess I was discussing that respondent had no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.136" offset="2346925">Now, in holding that respondent did have a privacy interest, the Court of Appeals majority relied on four factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.884" offset="2373987">However, those factors do not give rise to a privacy interest on respondent's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.162" offset="2395094">The Court of Appeals first relied on respondent's ownership of the Sea Otter, but the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches protects personal privacy, not property rights, and this Court has made clear that ownership of the searched area or object does not as such create the requisite Fourth Amendment privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.701" offset="2481194">Bare title does not itself create an expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.730" offset="2501361">Now, this is not to suggest that the Court has abandoned all reference to property interests in analyzing privacy or that the fact of ownership is invariably irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.149" offset="2547023">Ownership will often be associated with some use or occupancy or control of the property, including the exclusion of others that raises an expectation of privacy, but it is the expectation of privacy deriving from the use or control of the property and not the abstract fact of ownership as such that is the governing Fourth Amendment consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.810" offset="2637615">Where, as here, the property was never used by the owner, who bought it for the purpose of having other people use it, and had been turned over to the custody and control of others, the owner's paper title does not establish a privacy interest on his part.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.338" offset="3011793">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.337" offset="3015764">I think the nature of the property that is put into place is relevant to the kind of expectation of privacy that one might have in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.162" offset="3043036">I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.006" offset="3046484">But let me say in this case all that is far removed from the facts here, where the respondent did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.565" offset="3072711">Let me also add that even if the owner had made some use of the property prior to turning it over to someone else, the duration of the relinquishment here would be such that we think he would have lost any privacy interest he might previously have had as the result of use, but our primary position here is that he never had any expectation of privacy in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.808" offset="3153690">Now, the second factor relied on by the Court of Appeals was respondent's possessory interest in the marijuana that was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.382" offset="3183992">This Court's decisions in Salvucci and in Rawlings unmistakably hold that a possessory interest in the items seized neither establish the necessary privacy interest in the areas searched nor serves as a substitute or a surrogate for that privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.546" offset="3256613">The Court of Appeals opinion confuses the analytically distinct concepts of an interference with a possessory interest in the seized items, which is the defining characteristic of a seizure, and the intrusion upon a privacy interest in the searched area which is the hallmark of a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.899" offset="3325994">Now, once again, this is not to say that the fact that a person keeps his possessions in a place may not be relevant to whether he has an expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.271" offset="3359535">The use one makes of a place, including its use as a repository for personal effects, is one indication of a privacy interest, and thus a possessory interest in the items found can be evidential of a person's expectation of privacy because of the use he made of the searched area.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.435" offset="3436126">But in this case it is clear the respondent never used the Sea Otter in a way that would in fact give rise to an expectation of privacy, and the Court of Appeals did not conclude otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.352" offset="3479803">Rather, it relied on the simple fact that respondent had a possessory interest in the seized marijuana, and it is that approach that was legally erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.640" offset="3560992">But Jeffers went well beyond that, as the Court has already recognized in Salvucci and in Rakas.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.624" offset="3580949">In Jeffers, the hotel room was rented by the defendant's aunts.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.027" offset="3598503">He had permission to use the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.932" offset="3606131">He had a key to the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.401" offset="3611983">He in fact entered it at various times for a variety of purposes, including the stores, the hiding of his drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.523" offset="3648554">The Court held that in that circumstance the defendant's access to use of the room gave him a sufficient expectation of privacy that he could move for the suppression of received evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.362" offset="3695888">Not just because of items other than drugs, but because of his access to and use of the room in ways that essentially made him a person who had a sufficient connection or had an expectation of privacy in the room even though he did not have a common law property right interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.059" offset="3750641">As I said, it was rented by his aunts, but he did have a key, he had their permission to use it, and in fact entered it at will for a variety of purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.072" offset="3778748">We have no quarrel with that interpretation of Jeffers as the Court has construed it in Rakas and in Salvucci.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.053" offset="3806647">We do not think Jeffers even at the time but certainly in light of Rakas and Salvucci, we don't think Jeffers can stand for the proposition that possessory interest in the item seized itself is enough to entitle defendant to challenge the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.548" offset="3856593">The Court held squarely to the contrary in Salvucci and in Rawlings.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.610" offset="3872894">Now, I should also say that Salvucci disposes of the respondent's argument that he was entitled to challenge the search because he was in constructive possession of the Sea Otter and its cargo of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.994" offset="3930363">Salvucci, in overturning the automatic standing rule of Jones versus United States, held that a possessory interest sufficient to establish criminal liability under substantive criminal law principles is not equivalent to a privacy interest protected under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.174" offset="3999117">The doctrine of constructive possession is probably the best example of the distinction recognized by the Court's analysis in Salvucci between criminal possession and Fourth Amendment privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.498" offset="4044466">Now, as a third factor, the Court of Appeals pointed to respondent's coventure status in the drug smuggling operation, but it is well settled by the decisions of this Court that a defendant cannot vicariously assert the Fourth Amendments rights of his confederates, and respondent concedes that proposition in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.037" offset="4122520">Nor did respondent acquire any expectation of his own in the Sea Otter by virtue of the smuggling activities of his co-venturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.972" offset="4158360">Nothing in Hunt's actions in this case created a privacy interest on respondent's part that did not otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.328" offset="4187721">Fourth Amendment privacy rights are personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.296" offset="4199633">And whatever the privacy rights those aboard the Sea Otter may have had cannot be claimed by or attributed to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.526" offset="4232547">And the Court of Appeals lastly considered the presence of water in the Sea Otter's hold which had to be pumped out in order to recover the marijuana debris to be a sign that steps had been taken to hide the marijuana and preserve privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.880" offset="4289912">This reasoning is flawed on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.253" offset="4307467">First, the fact that a criminal strived to conceal his acts from the authorities in the hopes that he will not get caught is scarcely the same thing as an expectation of privacy, let alone an expectation that society would recognize as reasonable and legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.591" offset="4364832">Moreover, there is no indication in this case that respondent had anything to do with the asserted attempt to conceal the marijuana or that it was intended to maintain his privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.648" offset="4409031">Furthermore, the most likely explanation for the presence of the water is not that it was used to conceal the marijuana that was being transported, but rather that it served as ballast after the multi-ton shipment of marijuana had been unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.675" offset="4465142">And as the government stated in its uncontested submission in the District Court, marijuana debris was observed on the Sea Otter in plain view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.387" offset="4683943">The reason it is put in the brief is not because it is relevant to the legal issue before the Court, but rather that there was an apparent discrepancy between the size of the shipment that was taken on in Colombia and the quantity that was attributed to respondent in the indictment, and we were simply trying to reconcile and make it clear that those figures could be explained in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.862" offset="4769834">Now, let me also say, and perhaps most importantly on this point, that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the cargo hold of a fishing boat, which is an area open to common access and subject to routine inspections by a variety of federal and state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.326" offset="4831692">Now, in reaching its holding, the Court of Appeals purported to rely on the conjunction of the foregoing four factors, but in this case none of those factors indicates that respondent had an expectation of privacy in the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.084" offset="4886758">Whether we take it individually or cumulatively, these factors do not suffice to give rise to a privacy interest for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.784" offset="4921553">Now, let me turn briefly to the seizure issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.611" offset="4936913">As I have discussed with Justice O'Connor before, respondent now places primary reliance on the brief in this Court, not on the issue of his expectation of privacy and the standing to challenge the cert, but rather on the argument that he was entitled as the owner to challenge the government's seizure of the Sea Otter and taking it to the Coast Guard station, and therefore can challenge the ensuing search as the fruit of that seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.976" offset="5034298">As I have discussed, we don't think that issue is properly preserved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.380" offset="5051956">It was not raised in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.020" offset="5058539">It was not preserved in the conditional plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.534" offset="5072541">It was not argued or decided by the Court of Appeals, and we think it plain that the issue of the validity of the search and the issue of the validity of the seizure are separate issues, and that the defendant had a legal obligation to raise and preserve that separate point below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.549" offset="6168639">At the time of the seizure, respondent had turned over custody and control of the Sea Otter to Hunt for a period of some two months, and Hunt's control was also to continue for an extended indefinite period thereafter as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.824" offset="6237707">Respondent is the owner, had no cognizable interest in the immediate freedom of movement of the Sea Otter, nor did the brief detention interfere with respondent's residual right to the return of the boat at some indeterminate time in the extended future, nor given its relative brevity did the detention deprive respondent of hits ability as the owner to determine the use that would be made of the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.032" offset="6342510">That would be true even if the detention had occurred before the marijuana was delivered to respondent's ranch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.014" offset="6374484">The few-hour delay that was occasioned by that detention in comparison to the two-month duration of the South American voyage was quite inconsequential, and did not impair the purpose to which respondent had put the Sea Otter, and beyond that, since the seizure in fact occurred after the marijuana delivery, we think it quite plain that the detention did not deprive respondent of any interest to determine the use of the Sea Otter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.502" offset="6476466">In sum, the brief temporary detention to take the Sea Otter to port did not affect any interest of respondents as the owner of the boat.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.868" offset="7669844">At 10:10 in the morning on the 28th of June of 1979, the fishing vessel Sea Otter was approached by a Coast Guard cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.909" offset="7710072">Three men from the Coast Guard cutter boarded the Sea Otter, seized it at a distance that may have been on the high seas, but the record is not precisely clear, took it under seizure, under detention some 15 miles into San Francisco Bay, under the Golden Gate Bridge, and still detaining the vessels, they put it in a berth at the Coast Guard facility at Urba Buena Island in San Francisco Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.553" offset="7836610">For an undetermined period, a fair inference would be between several hours and up to a day, both the crew and the vessel were detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.814" offset="7873703">At some point during that seizure, and as a fruit and direct result of the seizure, the Coast Guard pumped out the holds of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.764" offset="7917485">Pumping out the water, and apparently by some mechanism straining the contents of the marijuana, at the conclusion of which they had a little less than a handful of alleged marijuana residue, actually less than half a gram.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2014.219" offset="8203264">It was a fishing vessel, and it was a substantial size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.451" offset="8216221">The issue before the Court is very narrow, whether Mr. Quinn's ownership possessory rights of the vessel gave him standing to contest the seizure which produced the ultimate search to which we object, or whether independently Mr. Quinn's conjunction of interest in the vessel and his relationship with the members of the crew give him a privacy interest, but we should not and need not get to the ultimate inquiry if it can be satisfactorily answered by an analysis of the seizure issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.327" offset="8363761">Why, first of all, because a temporal analysis requires that you look at events in the way in which they occur, and in this case the seizure was first, the seizure was prerequisite to and antecedent to the ultimate search of which we complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.586" offset="8436799">In United States versus Place, the Court held that although no privacy interest of the defendant in that case were infringed, the fact that there was a seizure, an illegal seizure by virtue of its prolonged nature vitiated the subsequent opening of the luggage even though the dog sniff violated no reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.545" offset="8528645">This Court's cases in recant years have made explicit and clear that the Fourth Amendment protects the people against not only unreasonable searches, but also unreasonable seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.993" offset="8582353">In Jacobson and Maryland versus Macon the Court made clear the distinction between the interests protected by the proscription on improper searches as opposed to improper seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.582" offset="8636792">Seizures and the proscription on improper seizures protects people's interest in property, their possessory interest in things, and therefore it follows as a logical matter, as indeed Footnote 6 of the Salvucci opinion suggests, and I think Place on Pages 707 to 710 rather clearly holds that one need not show an expectation of privacy to object to a seizure, and also as Place tells us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.789" offset="8749537">If the search which is complained of comes about as a fruit of the improper seizure which precedes it, the rule of Wong Sun means that the search must follow independent of any separate judicial inquiry as to the privacy interest involved in the search of which defendant has complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.624" offset="8832920">In this case it is very simple, and I think although the government makes pro forma protestations to the contrary, and I won't make their concessions for them, it is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.137" offset="8870954">Mr. Quinn's possessory and proprietary interest in the vessel here give him standing to object to its seizure, which was of a prolonged nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.758" offset="8909406">His mere absence from the scene does not constitute a constitutional relinquishment of his right, because the owner of property can object to its improper procedure whether or not he is present at the time of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.065" offset="8958725">In order to object to the seizure, Mr. Quinn need not show an expectation of privacy in the item seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.780" offset="8993521">Indeed, the Fourth Amendment prohibition on improper seizures protects not a privacy interest but a possessory one, just as, for instance, in my briefcase here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.197" offset="9035212">I have two interests in it of a constitutional nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.494" offset="9056423">It is mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.648" offset="9061021">I own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.070" offset="9062693">Somebody gave it to me as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.179" offset="9071156">I have a right to the privacy of what is inside it, assuming that I don't do anything improper to give up my right, so the contents of it are protected by the Fourth Amendment's proscription on improper searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.203" offset="9131238">And thus, if someone were to come in, a government official, and look inside, and rummage through and find my rather messy notes inside, I could say I object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.371" offset="9179930">You violated my right to be free from improper seizures and either sue the person, if appropriate, or if evidence was found which the government sought to use against me, move to suppress it, and in order to do that, I need only show that my reasonable expectation of privacy, to use the language of Rakas, Rawlings, and Salvucci, was infringed by the governmental action or interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.565" offset="9268642">But suppose the government on the other hand does not open the briefcase, but a District of Columbia policeman on no basis whatsoever, let us assume for purposes of discussion, comes in here and seizes the briefcase, takes it out, puts it in a locker in the District of Columbia police headquarters, and keeps it there for three days, at the conclusion of which they bring Rex, the D.C. sniffer dog, up to my briefcase, and he takes a sniff, and terrible for me, Rex's tail points toward the sky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.237" offset="9423392">I am in serious trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.564" offset="9432691">And based on Rex's tail going up, and his sniffing and whining and the other information that he gives us as a trained, keen-eyed investigator, the District of Columbia police, having that probable cause, opens it up, and instead of finding mere old Xeroxes of 1800 cases, they find a quantity of a controlled substance, or a 1040 form which has been tampered with and suggests improper manipulation of the Internal Revenue Code by yours truly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.426" offset="9560169">I have not had my privacy expectations improperly violated because they had probable cause to open it up, but do I have a motion to suppress?</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.922" offset="9598098">Do I have a right to say I object, I move to suppress, or even a civil suit, assuming maliciousness of bad faith on the part of the police officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.731" offset="9629341">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.419" offset="9636133">Place tells us so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.412" offset="10504025">There are three reasons for that, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.787" offset="10509563">Number One is that we elected to rely on the government's submission as we have a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.112" offset="10530879">In other words, we are entitled to rely on the state of the record, and if we feel that it is sufficient, we need not add to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.720" offset="10557315">The burden is ours in the first instance, but if the Court has before it facts of record, we can rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.858" offset="10577899">Second, with respect to this Court's decisions in Rakas, Salvucci, and Rawlings, have put defense counsel in a terrible box, because in every case we have to analyze the situation and determine under the Court's holdings whether we should put our client on the witness stand or the witnesses on the witness stand and evaluate whether we have enough without that or whether that is necessary and what strategic advantage, if any, you give up to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.785" offset="10685524">And I felt that in this case I did not want to put my client on the stand because the government's submission was sufficient, and I elected to rest upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.016" offset="10718438">Third and finally, the real problem here is that standing, although in Rakas the Court noted its standing and the substantive issue really merged, they are always theoretically and temporally separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.354" offset="10771832">Standing is a threshold issue, and on many cases the record that comes before you is a record after plenary evidentiary hearing, so that you have a transcript which gives you a full set of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.162" offset="10823032">In this case, the District Court judge denied us an evidentiary hearing, and therefore many of the facts that would have been adduced had we been allowed to go forward would have been established and would be before you, and there are facts left out that hurt both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.968" offset="10890324">For instance, you cannot rely upon a fact which is not in the record that this vote was apparently under constructive seizure for weeks and months afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.448" offset="10920208">It is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.479" offset="10924387">And on the seizure issue, for instance, that would held us greatly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.325" offset="11387695">He was arrested living on the vessel in San Diego on August 8, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.153" offset="11403055">With respect to this case, the government's position comes down essentially to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.693" offset="11449240">Presence at the scene of the seizure, at the time of the seizure is the sine qua non for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.596" offset="11476825">In Rakas the Court says mere presence on the scene is not enough absent some other interest, and clearly for the government contend that would require everybody in order to protect their Fourth Amendment rights to run from place to place or thing to thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.479" offset="11556342">Presence at the scene is not the sine qua non.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.992" offset="11570343">It is in some cases an important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.101" offset="11582778">With respect to the constitutional protection which Mr. Quinn invokes which gives rise to his rights to object to the improper seizure of his vessel, the Court has said that history, although not determinative, is often illustrative in giving is an idea of the Fourth Amendment's scope and of its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.156" offset="11666996">The history of our country and indeed of the whole Revolution was one which in large part came about because of improper seizures of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.854" offset="11713808">In researching the brief, I was gratified to find that one of the incentive for the Revolutionary War was the seizure of John Hancock's sloop Liberty by the British because... it didn't have marijuana, it had Madeira wines on which the British allege that Mr. Hancock had not paid the appropriate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.236" offset="11799385">The history of the Fourth Amendment is steeped in the right of maritime ship owners to object to the seizure of their vessels, and Wong Sun tells us that Mr. Quinn as a ship owner who has not relinquished any interest has a right to object to the seizure and to any fruits of that seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.884" offset="11886007">Finally, there is one point that I wish to make that is suggested by the government's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.881" offset="11905965">In this case, if the government had gone to Mr. Quinn, an agent of some kind, a DEA agent, a Customs agent, and said, Mr. Quinn, we want permission to seize your vessel, bring it to Urba Buena Island and pump the holds, do we have your permission?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.639" offset="11993005">Sure, go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.028" offset="12002513">If at that time instead of Mr. Quinn having been charged in the District Court, the crew members had been charged, I think neither the prosecutor nor the District Court judge would have properly permitted an objection to be made by those persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.660" offset="12077014">He would have said, after hearing the facts to make sure there was a full and voluntary consent, he would have said, no, I find that Quinn had the capacity to consent, and therefore you are bound by his consent under Matlock, Bumper, and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.874" offset="12133961">It would appear to be only logical and fair that if a person has the capacity and power to consent to a seizure or search, they should have a correlative right to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.385" offset="12187983">I would submit to the Court that under the Matlock case if reason, logic, and a Fourth Amendment analysis tells us that a person has the capacity and ability to consent, then that same person has the capacity under the Fourth Amendment standing to raise an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.391" offset="12268022">Finally, if I could briefly address the issue of Mr. Quinn's privacy interest, in this regard, we rely on the Jeffers case and on Bumper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.449" offset="12320267">In Rakas the Court cited Jeffers and Bumper with approval for the proposition that ownership of the property searched coupled... ownership or possessory interest in the property searched coupled with the possessory interest in the property seized gives a reasonable expectation of privacy to allow one to object to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.861" offset="12413890">In Salvucci, the Court in, I believe, Footnote 5, cited Bumper and Jeffers for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.904" offset="12450043">In this case, Mr. Quinn was the owner of both the item searched, the place searched, and the item seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.558" offset="12476688">Under the holding of Jeffers and Bumpers, he has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.276" offset="12491525">Finally, the government appears, although they do not urge it here today, in their brief to raise an issue that one can never have an interest in contraband to permit the assertion of a Fourth Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.879" offset="12545965">While it is undoubtedly true that contraband in plain view, such as in Texas versus Brown, gives right to no fault amendment claim, it is also clear that in Rawlings, for instance, the Court held that Rawlings' ownership of the contraband was plainly a factor to be considered on the expectation of privacy issue, and in Trupiano and specifically in Jeffers the government made an identical argument, the very same argument that they made here today, urging that because Title 21 at that time provided that no person shall have an interest in contraband, that meant that no person could raise a Fourth Amendment objection to the seizure of contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.722" offset="12705312">The Court in Jeffers very plainly and conclusively held that that was erroneous, and that was in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.938" offset="12742196">In sum, Mr. Quinn as the owner and a person who had a possessory interest which was not relinquished by his giving or entrusting the vessel to a joint venture, has standing, has a right to object to the seizure of the vessel because it infringed his possessory right, just as any tuna fleet owner in a similar circumstance could raise an objection to the seizure and pumping of the hold of his vessel, so, too, does Mr. Quinn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.721" offset="12865285">An analysis of the facts and this Court's holding in Bumper and Jeffers show also independently of the seizure issue that Mr. Quinn has a reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.717" offset="12909276">However, proper Fourth Amendment analysis and this Court's holding in Jacobson, Macon, and Place would suggest that the resolution of the seizure issue alone takes care of the subsequent search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.883" offset="12982001">I have a few brief points, Mr. Chief Justice, none of which is central to the resolution of the case, but may help clarify the Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.989" offset="13014392">First, the District Court in this case did not deny an evidentiary hearing to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.907" offset="13030066">After the events that Mr. Iredale described, Mr. Iredale then asked the Court, will the court allow us to call Mr. Hunt in order to establish standing on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.014" offset="13074474">This is on Page 9A of the appendix to the petition, will the Court allow us to call Mr. Hunt?</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.669" offset="13089103">The court said, sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.091" offset="13094745">Then Mr. Iredale said that Hunt was in Costa Rica and would be brought back by the government for trial, at which point he would like to call Hunt on the standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.681" offset="13129122">The court said, make any motion you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.197" offset="13135183">The respondent chose to enter a conditional guilty plea at that point, and Hunt was never culled as a witness by either party, but the District Court did not cut off respondent's opportunity in any way to make the record that he desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.755" offset="13181472">Now, in his argument today, as in his brief, respondent's attorney has relied on a number of facts outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.375" offset="13211878">Again, we don't think any of them is particularly important to the disposition of the case, but it does illustrate the problem that arises when a defendant does not meet his burden as outlined in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.856" offset="13253883">It is the defendant's burden to make the record and to advance the proper legal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.464" offset="13268303">As an example, Mr. Iredale today referred to the constructive seizure of the Sea Otter that continued after the hold had been pumped out and marijuana was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.304" offset="13307591">I simply don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.788" offset="13313547">At that point the government could have seized, that is, forfeited the boat because it had been used in marijuana smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.411" offset="13332041">So the fact that the government retained the boat at that point simply has nothing to do with the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.065" offset="13354716">Now, contrary to Mr. Iredale's characterization, our argument is not that a defendant has to be present at the time of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.031" offset="13382510">Aldermand and Jeffers and countless other cases make that clear as we acknowledge in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.497" offset="13404453">Our argument here is much different.</text>
