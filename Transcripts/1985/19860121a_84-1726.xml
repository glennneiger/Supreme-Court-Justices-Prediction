            <text syncTime="22.428" offset="232078">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.974" offset="246289">All of the circuits that have addressed most of the questions that are here under consideration indicate agreement on certain aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.125" offset="306893">One, all circuits agree that admiralty law is applicable to this type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.028" offset="334478">All of the circuits also indicate their full agreement that strict liability in torts is applicable in admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.055" offset="382544">Four of the five responding circuits had enunciated a rule relative to the damages that are pleadable and collectible in a strict liability and tort claimed under admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.406" offset="452029">One circuit assumes a different posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.936" offset="470106">Before I address specifically the question involved, I would most respectfully invite the Court's attention to two or three, quote, "facts" as set forth in the opinion here under consideration and of the Third Circuit which do not seem to comport with the record upon which those particular findings were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.689" offset="581179">And the most grievous, if I may refer to it as such, is the references in the opinion written by Judge Hunter that the one ship involved, the Bay Ridge, never left the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.652" offset="652963">Indulge me for a moment to succinctly outline the differing factors of the first of the three ships and the Bay Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.601" offset="692774">The episode all started by the problem that was encountered by the Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.472" offset="728300">At the time the Stuyvesant encountered that particular problem, there was then under construction at a shipyard in Brooklyn the Bay Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.514" offset="780441">The shipyard that constructed the four of these supertankers was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.745" offset="805309">The supplier of the turbines that were installed in these particular supertankers was also the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.883" offset="841881">Now, at the time the Stuyvesant experienced its problem, there was a decision made... The basis for the decision I will review very shortly... that the circumstances required an exchange of the ring that was then at the Bay Ridge, and have it transported for installation into the Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.432" offset="972075">Thereafter, as far as the Bay Ridge was concerned, there was manufactured a ring different than the original four rings, which newly constructed ring incorporated the recommendations of these plaintiffs' experts, and that ring was thereafter installed in that Bay Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.465" offset="1104255">It is that plaintiff's position relative to the Bay Ridge that at the time that Bay Ridge left that shipyard and while it was en route to its destination, the problem encountered by that ship had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the manufacture of the ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.391" offset="1215954">What happened, at the time that properly constructed ring was being installed in that turbine of the Bay Ridge, some of the appurtenances that had to be installed in order for that turbine to be functional, more specifically a guardian stern bow, was installed in reverse and this installation occurred under the supervision of the representatives of Delaval.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.098" offset="1342805">As a result of that valve being installed in reverse, improper steam got into that turbine and it was the improper steam that got into that turbine that caused the disintegration of the components of that particular turbine.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.731" offset="1417306">At the time of the episode with the Bay Ridge, when that ring was taken out it was thereafter, it being the first ring, it was thereafter installed in the Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.303" offset="1479582">Now, it may be appropriate now to note that the opinion of the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit made mention on page 7, part of it is carried over to page 8 of its opinion, that the plaintiff did not seek to order a new part from Delaval but in lieu of doing that, obtained the ring out of the Bay Ridge.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.509" offset="1596402">Are you asking us to make some factual determinations in this Court that... don't we take the facts as we find them in the court of appeals opinion, or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="377.629" offset="1652930">Well, on the point that I just mentioned, I thought if the fact would be a fact obtainable from the record and the specific circumstance, in the court of appeals opinion... the court of appeals expressly states that it's making its findings on a hypothesis that that ship never left the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.135" offset="1738926">That ship not only left the pier, but that ship was in the middle of the ocean when it encountered this difficulty, when it was in total distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.163" offset="1779050">And that was never a circumstance--</text>

            <text syncTime="418.237" offset="1815308">--I am, sir, but there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.283" offset="1831504">That one has to do with the question of the negligence, and the other has to do with the specific circumstance of the applicability of strict liability and tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.090" offset="1870687">Now, what is suggested by the question that's submitted, factually outlined, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.180" offset="1919066">May the manufacturer of a turbine, which turbine is to be the power unit of a 225,000 &lt;DWT&gt; [= DWT] ton tanker, represent to the shipyard that if that manufacturer can supply a turbine to that particular ship so as for that ship to acquire propulsion, and thereafter when that ship is completed and that ship is sold and that ship is chartered, should that charterer as was the fact here, be responsible without redress to collect in damage approximately two million dollars paid by these plaintiffs to this defendant, Delaval, for that defendant then to do that which that defendant was obligated to at the time of the particular initial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.980" offset="2202338">Differently stated, the split in the circuits seems to suggest, according to the Third Circuit, this plaintiff may not collect this type of damage in strict liability in tort, even though the damages that were caused to this particular charterer are without question damages caused by the negligent or improper construction of the turbine at the time of original construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.979" offset="2358341">There has been much suggested in all opinions relative to this phrase, "economic loss".</text>
            <text syncTime="561.852" offset="2389793">The damages that were sought to be collected here were basically four in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.302" offset="2415602">One, those monies paid by these plaintiffs directly to Delaval, an amount just the right side of two million dollars, which monies were paid to Delaval to do to those rings that which the law imposed upon Delaval to do in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.167" offset="2519046">Two--</text>

            <text syncTime="618.470" offset="2616222">That which this plaintiff paid to that manufacturer, the amount I refer to, roughly two million dollars, was for that manufacturer to give to that charterer a turbine which that manufacturer, not by means of contract but by operation of law was required to supply in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.372" offset="6675859">The issue before the Court is whether under federal maritime law damage to a product caused by a design defect is recoverable in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.274" offset="6723507">The product in this case is the main propulsion units for four vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.193" offset="6743151">Both the district court and the Third Circuit en banc held that petitioners do not have federal maritime tort claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.231" offset="6991314">We draw no distinction between strict tort liability for negligence and product liability law, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.666" offset="7020989">This is exactly the type of tort that appellate courts in both the states and federal appellate courts have dealt with many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.255" offset="7067383">It is not an unusual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.786" offset="7073548">It is a routine matter for them, and what they have held in the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions is that recovery is denied in tort where a product itself simply fails to function properly but is not unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.075" offset="7134674">In these circumstances, they leave the parties to their contractual remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.370" offset="7155886">At the commencement of this action there were ten plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.805" offset="7181590">In addition to the four petitioners there Sea Train Lines which is a large, substantial corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, Sea Train Shipbuilding which built the four vessels involved and which contracted to have them built with the respondent, four wholly owned subsidiaries of Sea Train Lines which were the original owners of the four vessels involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.280" offset="7283468">Respondent had an extensive agreement with Shipbuilding for the design and manufacture of the main propulsion units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.010" offset="7322442">The contract contained an express warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.056" offset="7334563">It disclaimed any warranties other than the warranty expressly set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.648" offset="7356924">It provided for certain remedies such as repair and replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.177" offset="7375105">It expressly excluded liability for consequential damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.894" offset="7389943">Respondent moved for summary judgment and on the motion asked for dismissal of the breach of contract and the breach of warranty claims on the basis of the statute of limitations and various contractual provisions which limited plaintiff's remedy, and the disclaimer of warranties other than the warranty that was expressly granted under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.026" offset="7478446">The claims, Sea Train Lines Shipbuilding and the four other Sea Train subsidiaries which are not now before the Court, all were dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.505" offset="7524421">In addition, all the contract claims and warranty claims were dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.158" offset="7555037">Therefore, we had... the current owners, as you know, are not before the Court, so what we have is that the four petitioners, the present charterers of the vessels, are the only remaining plaintiffs and their claims are exclusively in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.981" offset="7610312">All of their contract and warranty claims have been dismissed on the merits and with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.869" offset="7633822">There are five counts in the complaint that this Court is asked to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.539" offset="7656496">The first four counts involve a particular component of the main propulsion units for the guide bucket ring, and in each of these counts which relates to a particular vessel, that each of the charterers is a charterer of one of those vessels, the complaint is that there was a malfunction of the guide bucket ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.530" offset="7736535">On the fifth count one of the owners claims... this is the Bay Ridge which is the ship that's involved in counts four and five... there was a negligence claim, the only negligence claim before you, and the claim is that the respondent failed to supervise the installation of the stern guardian valve which was installed in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.445" offset="7816157">And I would just point out as an aside, the record reveals that the Bay Ridge was the fourth ship built.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.990" offset="7838308">The same part had been installed properly by Sea Train Shipbuilding in the three prior ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.738" offset="7861296">In any event, the damage was confined to the main propulsion units themselves in all of these counts, but consisted only of internal deterioration and breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.920" offset="7910093">There was no damage to persons or other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.637" offset="7920960">There was no unreasonable risk of harm to persons or other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.416" offset="7936006">And as Mr. Durkin has candidly said, what is sought here is consequential damage in the form of nature of cost and replacement and lost profits from down time, primarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.647" offset="8296914">Your Honor, the construction of the Stuyvesant which is the Stuyvesant ship and its events are the seminal events in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.220" offset="8335262">The Stuyvesant's construction was completed in 1977, and I should add that the construction contract which I described before is a 1970 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.685" offset="8373087">In December '77, as the Stuyvesant was entering the port of Valdiz in Alaska, it had a steam escape problem of some dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.072" offset="8410704">The problem was solved in the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.009" offset="8422406">There is no allegation that that steam escape problem led to any damage of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.507" offset="8448424">The Stuyvesant then proceeded to load the oil on the ship and proceeded two days later on its voyage down to the Panama Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.191" offset="8479144">On that voyage it experienced a problem with its turbine, and I want to say that I heard in the opening argument a reference to a ship without power being in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.686" offset="8521149">The Stuyvesant was not without power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.950" offset="8530135">The Stuyvesant operated at a substantial amount of power at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.808" offset="8549570">What occurred with the Stuyvesant was that it was not able to attain its normal speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.447" offset="8568170">The record shows that the guide bucket ring and the main propulsion units did not function the way they were supposed to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.054" offset="8598576">There was a malfunction of the main propulsion unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.989" offset="8606308">But even as it is suggested on the record that the Stuyvesant encountered high seas and some drifting on this voyage down the West Coast off the Panama Canal Zone, nevertheless it made sufficient headway even in a storm that is described by petitioners as having some severity, it had enough power to weather the storm and it made the voyage successfully and in fact off-loaded its oil at the Panama Canal Zone and then proceeded back without incident to the port of San Francisco.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.114" offset="8778821">I agree with the test enunciated by the Third Circuit, and as I understand the majority of land-based rule, one could have a risk without the harm occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.703" offset="8821139">It is very difficult, I think in most instances, to imagine liability without harm actually occurring but I suppose it would be conceivable under some circumstances that risk alone might give rise to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.369" offset="8867846">But, Your Honor, both the district court and the court of appeals for a practical matter have determined that there's no triable issue as to risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.914" offset="8898044">They have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.334" offset="8903686">So, I really don't think that that is left in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.193" offset="8915180">When the Stuyvesant reached San Francisco an inspection of the engine revealed damage to this guide bucket ring, and it was then replaced as we know with a part from the Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.281" offset="8971500">That part did not perform terribly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.561" offset="8984666">The Stuyvesant resumed operation with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.764" offset="8993443">There was no further malfunction, but ultimately the guide bucket ring was replaced with a newly designed guide bucket ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.089" offset="9018730">That was the story of the Stuyvesant, and really it is the only ship which involves much of any incident at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.851" offset="9045793">As far as the counts two and three of the complaint at concern, they involve the ships which we call the Brooklyn and the Williamsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.567" offset="9080692">Both of these ships have been constructed prior to the Stuyvesant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.753" offset="9101381">They were older ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.939" offset="9106083">They had already seen substantial service at the time that the Stuyvesant encountered the high seas leaving the port of Valdez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.000" offset="9138370">These ships never had a malfunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.138" offset="9150909">They never had any problem with their engines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.310" offset="9159582">After the Stuyvesant incident, and only because of the Stuyvesant incident, both of these ships had their engines opened in port and there it was discovered that there was a low level of deterioration which one could contend showed that they had the same problem as the Stuyvesant guide bucket ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.411" offset="9231993">Those guide bucket rings were replaced with newly designed guide bucket rings, ultimately.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.714" offset="10873215">The charterers had an opportunity to protect themselves by contract and they entered into an extensive charter agreement, one charter for each of them, which is contained in the record and that charter allocates the very risks that we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.130" offset="10938939">As a matter of fact it requires, if it is true that under the charter the charterers are required to make the repairs to the vessel, but that was a bargained for matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.781" offset="10973525">It was a matter that was within the realm of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.327" offset="10987631">So, there can't be any credible claim but that the exact claim that is made here could not have been protected as a matter of contract right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.899" offset="12137959">And the Court is very explicit in its language, and as a matter of fact they say very succinctly in a quote that I think summarizes our position very well, they say, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.066" offset="12334609">The contract that we entered into was a 1970 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.017" offset="12354462">Quite a few many years later, to be held to a standard of guaranteeing that product when there's no safety implication but the argument is that the product was qualitatively defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.543" offset="12408588">Indeed, I would say that if the majority land-based rule isn't used, it's difficult to see where the function of tort law, or I should say where the function of contract law would really function in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.879" offset="12477864">It seems to me that it would be tantamount to saying that the product manufacturer is a guarantor of this product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.080" offset="12502733">There's another point that I want to make that I think also supports the view that the majority land-based rule should be used, and that is that in fact on the contract side, the Uniform Commercial Code which is what we're talking about predominantly on the contract side, has been adopted in 49 of the states and even in the 50th it has been adopted in rather substantial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.976" offset="12602312">This is an opportunity for the Court to determine the federal maritime law would be uniform with land-based law and I would point out that there's basically no difference between ship engines and car engines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.014" offset="13010449">I can't say too frequently that the power... all that happened in our case, and with only one of the four engines, we're talking about, is that it failed to attain full power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.620" offset="13044826">It attained very substantial power because it powered right through whatever storm it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.821" offset="13065619">The second question that Your Honor raises, which I regard as a hypothetical question, as to whether or not a ship bereft of any power on the seas, one would wish to know what seas they were in, whether or not there were tugs available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.425" offset="13116088">Yes, there is some risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.893" offset="13121939">The question would have to rely upon the facts as to exactly how great a risk there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.250" offset="13139389">But your point you're making is, that is not this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.390" offset="13151928">Not this case, and it has been so determined not to be this case, Your Honor, by the Third Circuit en banc and the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.502" offset="13268434">It really seems to me that this is a matter that's better left to the area of contract law rather than tort law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.453" offset="13300199">There's one further consideration that I wanted to state, and that's frequently as a basis, the product tort liability law, the courts have said the manufacturer has a greater ability to distribute the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.730" offset="13349309">I think once again that as between large commercial entities, that rationale doesn't really operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.976" offset="13378253">I think as between large commercial entities, they both have the ability to insure or to otherwise spread the risk to their customers in the form of higher prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.082" offset="13410749">That rationale simply makes no sense here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.863" offset="13421825">And as a matter of fact, I would suggest that in many cases, actually the large commercial user of the product is in better shape to distribute the risk to the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.108" offset="13466756">It knows the particular use to which the product will be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.216" offset="13479190">It knows the particular voyages that will be undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.340" offset="13491729">It knows the particular hazards to which it intends to subject the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.886" offset="13505939">So, I think that that rationale doesn't hold up here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.213" offset="13519210">We urge the Court to adopt the majority land-based rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.476" offset="13540317">We believe that at least as between large commercial entities, the user of a defective product who is complaining about the quality of the product below, should be left to his complaint in contract law and not tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.345" offset="13595801">Commercial entities similarly situated should be left to their contractual remedies, those they can bargain for in the commercial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.435" offset="13632163">We say that unless safety is implicated, the tort principle simply shouldn't interfere with their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.230" offset="13659330">We ask the Court to confirm that petitioners do not have Federal Maritime Court claims, and we ask that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, dismissing this action, be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.239" offset="13719308">Very briefly, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.315" offset="13735608">In response to the questions that Justice O'Connor asked of my adversary, no matter what else we may disagree on, both of us fully agree that at the time that that Bay Ridge left that shipyard, that ring was 1OO percent good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.559" offset="13796630">There was nothing wrong with that ring at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.480" offset="13808333">When that turbine was being installed, not under any strict liability in tort or anything else, there is a valve that's required to be installed to govern the input of steam to that particular turbine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.910" offset="13866011">That valve was put in negligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.488" offset="13880326">It was put in, in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.283" offset="13887536">When that ship had traveled almost to Chile, because of that valve being put in wrong the turbine malfunctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.966" offset="13938214">Our claim on that Bay Ridge couldn't be more addressed to a straight negligence cause of action if we tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.947" offset="13978129">And the only damages that we're claiming there are the damages that are permitted under any rule when that negligence is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.255" offset="14023373">And the second, and hopefully the last point, with Justice Rehnquist, we're taking a position throughout that the rule that should govern is the rule of the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.485" offset="14076349">As long as the Third Circuit drafted a rule other than that, there is no way that we could rebel against the granting of a summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.760" offset="14129430">What the circumstance or the applicability of that risk is, of course is a factual question, or record of which is never in the shape it should be at this particular posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.552" offset="14180630">If the Third Circuit's rule in rejecting the risk theory is that there must be the actual, then concededly there is positively not fact issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.686" offset="14237159">There wasn't any injury, and there wasn't any additional damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.105" offset="14254818">But if the risk rule is to be adopted and applied in admiralty, then we respectfully request that the matter be remanded for a plenary hearing or fact determinations consistent with that participation.</text>
