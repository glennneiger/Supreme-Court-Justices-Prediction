            <text syncTime="18.056" offset="214993">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented today arose out of a state criminal proceeding in Jefferson County, Kentucky, in which the prosecutor employed four of the six peremptory challenges that were allotted to him under court rule to remove all black persons on the panel of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.110" offset="287196">These panel members had all survived the challenges for cause under the Kentucky system, which is called the blind strike system, and peremptory challenges are made at all... at the close of all challenges for cause, and they are made by means of striking from identical lists simultaneously names of the jurors that either party wishes to have removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.556" offset="376953">But before the jury was sworn, trial counsel for petitioner made a motion to discharge the panel on the ground that the removal of the four blacks by these peremptory challenges denied the right to trial by an impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution and also denied equal protection of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.516" offset="460753">The petitioner asked for a hearing on his motion, but it was denied basically on the ground that anybody can strike anybody they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.574" offset="497011">Those are the words of the trial judge in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.808" offset="505998">The same issue was raised on appeal, on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, and that court also affirmed by stating that an allegation of lack of a fair cross section on a jury which does not concern systematic exclusion from the jury drum, which is the composition device for the jury list, does not rise to constitutional proportions, and therefore the court refused to adopt any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.438" offset="604531">I think as the Court can see, neither of the trial court nor the Supreme Court of Kentucky was willing to consider any regulation of peremptory challenges, and I think both followed the conventional interpretation of Swain versus Alabama which this Court decided in 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.114" offset="715186">It was not argued, although it was mentioned, but there is no doubt that they could have proceeded on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.643" offset="737338">The conventional interpretation of Swain is that there can be no question of peremptory challenges and the way that they are exercised in any one particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.638" offset="781328">This has been the basis for decisions of the many state courts who have refused to consider the newer rules that have been advanced by the Supreme Court of California, the court in Massachusetts, and more recently by two federal appellate courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.716" offset="2497573">Put even before this Court's cases decided in the &lt;nineteen forty's&gt; [= 1940's] under the supervisory power, there has always been an idea that the jury must be representative of the community, and we have provided in our brief a compilation of some statements on this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.757" offset="2569775">And the practical reason for this is to interpose a body of untrained citizens between the defendant and the forces of the prosecutor, so that when the prosecutor employs his challenges to remove a cognizable group from the jury that is actually going to sit, he is destroying any chance that this jury is going to be as representative of the jury as is possible, given the fact that you must reduce the community to a panel and finally to a petit jury of 12 or 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.072" offset="2683042">When the prosecutor does this, he is attacking the democratic aspect of the jury wherein the community consents to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.522" offset="2724838">It is not left simply to the administrative officers in charge of the matter, but the community itself by its representatives' consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.394" offset="2756290">The federal courts of appeal have begun adopting a rule that basically follows the rule set out in Wheeler versus California, and these cases reject the convoluted and probably often poorly understood statistical analyses that are associated with the venire composition cases, and have instead returned to what I consider to be a more well known pattern of evidentiary inferences, and all of the cases that are listed in the briefs begin with the concept announced in Taylor versus Louisiana which talks about the federal right to jury trial, and that is that the selection of a petit jury from a representative cross section of the community is an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.904" offset="5578350">I believe the necessity for the change is shown by the large number of complaints that have been made in recent years concerning the practice of peremptory challenges used by the prosecutor to remove specific groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.679" offset="5657449">In the petition for certiorari that was filed on behalf of Batson we were able to list some 25 jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.862" offset="5690154">Since that time I believe five or six more jurisdictions have considered the matter, and this has come to a point that the court must rethink its decision in Swain and look again at the two premises on which the Swain decision was predicated, that of the history of the peremptory challenge and also of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.399" offset="5792345">I think in answer to Justice White's questions, we have spoken somewhat about the history and as our brief shows the peremptory challenge that is a peremptory challenge for the prosecutor has been in existence probably for only about 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.953" offset="5862562">Before that time, as the cases show, the process of standing aside was under the control of the trial court, and if the prosecutor used too this device too much, against too many prospective jurors, the trial court could intervene, so that regulation was the norm before the middle part of the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.960" offset="5954618">I think a more important reason is that at the time Swain was decided this Court had nothing to look at in terms of whether peremptory challenges could serve their function of removing jurors who might be biased but whom the parties could not show to be biased without interfering with that practice that now the practice can be regulated, and this is shown by the number of jurisdictions that have adopted the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.262" offset="9927738">The trial judge then would have to determine whether or not he believed counsel and, of course, whether or not there was a strong likelihood that there had been discrimination purely based on numbers wherein a situation such that the prosecutor struck two blacks out of four.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.390" offset="11456319">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the theme of the brief we have filed in this case is that far from standing as an aberration in the law, Swain against Alabama fits into a consistent pattern with all of this Court's related jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.162" offset="11539389">Swain was an equal protection case, but surely the opinion's careful analysis of the historic role and purposes of the peremptory challenge system is even more directly relevant to the meaning of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.216" offset="11627578">The Court in Swain suggested that the peremptory challenge at least on the part of the defendant may well be a necessary part of that right, although it also said that the Court had previously said the Constitution doesn't require it, but certainly the implications of the analysis in Swain is that the peremptory challenge system as we have known it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to trial by impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.780" offset="11761847">Some of the briefs filed in this case suggest that history more firmly supports the right on the part of the defendant than on the part of the prosecution, but even if that is true, that does not in any way undermine the constitutionality of statute law or rules of courts such as the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which allow the use of the peremptory by the prosecution as well as a counterbalance to its use by the defendant so that the objective of the Sixth Amendment, trial by an impartial jury, is more effectively achieved by lopping off from the panel those who in the judgment of the litigants are somewhat less likely in their own speculative judgment to decide the case impartially on the basis of the evidence in the context of the particular case.</text>
