            <label>Mr. William A. Coats</label>
            <text syncTime="6.654" offset="176397">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.522" offset="187891">The issue is this case is whether a public school district may regulate indecent speech in a public school setting that does not amount to obscene speech under this Court's Miller versus California standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.031" offset="245883">The facts in this case are that on April 26th, 1983, Matt Fraser, a 17 year old high school senior, gave a speech to the associated student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="287679">The speech was to introduce his candidate for the vice president's position of the associated student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.910" offset="325400">He gave a crude and vulgar speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.814" offset="341073">The speech is set forth in full in the briefs and there's no purpose to repeat it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.783" offset="360926">It is important to note that Mr. Fraser did obtain significant reaction to his speech, that some of the students hooted and hollered, some of the students looked bewildered, some looked embarrassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.775" offset="412858">Some students even acted out certain physical acts symbolizing various sexual acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.929" offset="441488">After the speech, the school administration investigated the incident and provided Mr. Fraser with his due process rights and suspended him for three days and struck him from the list of those candidates who would be considered to be a graduation speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="499898">Mr. Fraser appealed to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.824" offset="513064">The district court, as affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, has ruled that public school districts can only regulate student speech if it is obscene under the Miller versus California standard, or the one exception they seemingly recognized is if the speech caused a physical disruption or there was a reasonable prediction of a physical disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.487" offset="595715">Finally, the district court, as affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, struck down the district's disruptive conduct rule, holding it was overbroad and vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.362" offset="639287">It is well decided and we agree that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.433" offset="667499">However, it is equally well decided that those constitutional rights will be administered in a way that is sensitive to the speech environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.324" offset="715147">We are here because the Ninth Circuit we believe has misconstrued the extent of the rights a student has under the First Amendment in the public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.548" offset="756002">They failed to recognize the special relationship between students and their teacher; and finally, they failed to recognize the secondary effects such conduct has in the public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.522" offset="803859">In beginning our analysis of the First Amendment, it is useful to compare this case with this Court's decision in Tinker versus Des Moines School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.295" offset="842938">In Tinker, the facts were that students wore black arm bands into the public schools in protest of the Vietnam War.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.568" offset="880032">There was nothing intrinsically harmful about the black arm bands.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.637" offset="900303">What the school officials were concerned about was that the black arm bands stood for protest against this Government's position in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.212" offset="942621">Tinker was a viewpoint discrimination case, where the school officials determined that that viewpoint on an important student policy issue should not be interjected in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.003" offset="993821">Contrasting that case with this fact pattern, it is noteworthy that Mr. Fraser at testimony was asked,</text>
            <text syncTime="219.109" offset="1026213">"What was the purpose of your speech? "</text>
            <text syncTime="221.478" offset="1035721">He responded quite candidly:</text>
            <text syncTime="223.211" offset="1042618">"I gave the speech to humor my audience, in the hopes they would vote for my candidate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="230.750" offset="1072815">There's no overriding public policy.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Coats</label>
            <text syncTime="251.914" offset="1157452">It's a school that has sophomores through seniors, so the youngest would be 14, the oldest would be 18, and they would range in there according to their grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.202" offset="1194650">Mr. Fraser... you will note that the district did not take cavalierly his claims that he was being discriminated against or that somehow his viewpoint was being suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.510" offset="1243865">If you review the record in this case, you'll find that Mr. Fraser appealed to the district's hearing officer from the decision of his building principal, and I think if you read that decision, which is part of the joint appendix, that one of the conclusions that was not overturned by the district court was that there was no viewpoint discrimination here, that the district's sole concern was to limit vulgarity and indecent language in the school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.810" offset="1349086">This Court has been very clear and has often repeated that it does not want to get involved in the daily operations of the school system, that it only wants to get involved when core constitutional values are involved and sharply implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.487" offset="1415751">This Court has also indicated that the regulation of vulgarity and indecent speech is on the periphery of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.878" offset="1453367">We submit to this Court that when you review this case one of the issues is where does the federal court system relate itself to the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.834" offset="1493178">And we would suggest to you, with the rights herein involved and the speech here involved, absent viewpoint suppression, that there should be minimal court review and that all a school district should be required to do is to justify its actions with a reasonable educational purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.445" offset="1567575">This is an extracurricular assembly?</text>
            <text syncTime="356.731" offset="1576770">It's not part of the regular... the students were not required to attend, is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Coats</label>
            <text syncTime="360.183" offset="1590562">Well, I want to be very clear on what the context is, because I think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.920" offset="1609475">It was, students had the option of either going to the assembly or going to a study hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.757" offset="1636851">Now, the ASB, however, in the State of Washington is an activity that is statutorily recognized and required.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.512" offset="1671855">And those statutes, which are RCW-28A.58.115 through 120, I think you'll find that they're somewhat uniquely specific in this area compared to the other states that I have seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.737" offset="1712711">And they make very clear that this activity is under the direction and control of the public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.891" offset="1741341">So this is no more an elective activity that, for example, when a student elects to take drama rather than going to a study hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.164" offset="1770494">This is a part of the educational program of this particular school district, as it is in other school districts in of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.705" offset="3784639">And I think it's important to note that the district acted with restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.407" offset="3799477">Again, if you read the record from the school district, one of the findings of the hearing officer who considered this was that a lesser form of corrective action would not have corrected this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.298" offset="3847019">Indeed, the speech district feels strongly that in its capacity as an educator and dealing with these students it had an obligation to respond to this particular speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.940" offset="3889547">Mr. Fraser seems to argue that the school district's sole remedy is to talk it over with him, to debate with him the appropriateness of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.211" offset="3930611">We submit to this Court that Mr. Fraser's argument misconstrues the relationship of a student to an educator.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.215" offset="3958615">It's not a relationship of one debater to another, that indeed the educator has authority over the student when properly exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.440" offset="3995604">Finally, we submit to you that the real question is if the speech district could regulate this speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.492" offset="4015770">This Court held as recently as last week in the Public Utilities case out of California that the First Amendment does not dictate that you respond or ignore a speech, or as we would phrase it, the First Amendment may restrict a school district's ability to censor various views in the student school system, but once they are able to regulate an area, such as vulgarity and indecency, the First Amendment does not dictate how they must go about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.709" offset="4120678">We also note that there are important secondary effects in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.213" offset="4146696">We think it's important that this came up under the school district's disruptive conduct rule, and when you read that rule, clearly a school district has the right to proscribe disruptive conduct in the school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.223" offset="4202703">And this board of directors in advance gave notice and concluded that obscene and profane speech was inherently harmful and disruptive to the public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.613" offset="4252231">Essentially what the Ninth Circuit has held is that a public school district cannot reach that conclusion and cannot have such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.036" offset="4285981">We submit to you that the board's determination that vulgarity and indecency was inherently harmful in the public school setting is supported by a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.444" offset="4331539">First of all, the school has a duty to protect the young adults, who are there in essentially a captive audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.200" offset="4362572">Secondly, such conduct is inherently demeaning to the school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.187" offset="4390575">This is where we require in the State of Washington students to come to learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.139" offset="4406353">As this Court has recognized in cases such as Pico, where the plurality spoke, and where it expressed its concern in that opinion that the district did not have the authority to suppress ideas in the school setting, but it had no problem, it said, if there had been a facially neutral rule designed to prohibit indecent language in a public school setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.805" offset="4713031">And this Court has recognized that there are some lesser standards which may apply in particular situations, such as in FCC versus Pacifica, the Mini Theatres case out of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.898" offset="4769351">And we're suggesting that a lesser standard is appropriate in a public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.283" offset="4786905">Now, the standard that we have proposed essentially is that first you look at the constitutional right we're enforcing, and that when there is a suppression of ideas or a discrimination against ideas, that the school district have to show with a higher standard or show some compelling interest its reason for suppressing those ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.530" offset="4867885">But here, where the only... where the record clearly shows that the only purpose for the school's action was to suppress vulgarity and indecency in the public school setting, then we would suggest to the Court that a school district should only have to meet a standard of showing a rational educational basis, and clearly there is such a basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.459" offset="5047607">I think my response to you was that we have no written decisions in construing this, and that to my knowledge this is the first time that the district had construed its own rule where there was a record kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.002" offset="5109779">Now, school rules are enforced on a daily basis in the public school setting, and I can assure you that if a student swears or is vulgar in the school setting, whether it's in a classroom, in the hall, or in an assembly, school officials have taken corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.097" offset="5178219">But most of the time we don't get an appeal from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.501" offset="5195774">Here there was also, as is shown in the record, there was a prior occasion the year before where a student used, actually in as ASB assembly, used inappropriate speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.789" offset="5232972">And indeed, the district called the student into the office, and in fact the principal talked to him and what he would consider disciplined him, told him that, you know, that better be stopped or he's going to be in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.129" offset="5274350">Now, Mr. Fraser construes that, he says, well, he knew that speech was given and he thought that the only that happened was the principal called him in and talked to him about it, big deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.770" offset="5312907">I mean, he gives probably the best evidence we have of why the district in this case was compelled to take a more demonstrative action to impress upon the students that this was not appropriate speech in that particular forum, in that public setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.136" offset="5518334">He said that two teacher told Matt Fraser don't give it, is what he said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.725" offset="5548740">"I told Matt that his speech was inappropriate and that he probably should not deliver it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.860" offset="5569220">That was the first teacher, who was most critical of the speech, Mrs. Hicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.014" offset="5593880">That's at page 30 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.133" offset="5606314">The second teacher, I'm quoting:</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.370" offset="5627317">"My response at that time was that I told Matt that this would indeed cause problems and that it would raise eyebrows. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.476" offset="5655738">That was the extent of his warning not to give the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.661" offset="5672456">None of them suggested that it might violate a school rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.047" offset="5686040">If fact, the first teacher, who was most critical of it, said in her testimony afterwards at the trial:</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.783" offset="5712894">"I wasn't that there was a school rule regarding that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.604" offset="5728254">In this case, if the teachers don't have any idea that such a speech might violate a school rule, when they are charged with enforcement of the school rule as among their duties as teachers, the rule is clearly so vague and so lacking of adequate notice, at least when it comes to First Amendment rights, freedom of speech, that they cannot punish a student who gave a speech after previewing it with three teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.683" offset="13112548">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.802" offset="13124982">By way of response, Mr. Haley did read from the record, but he didn't go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.306" offset="13151000">And I did ask, when the teacher said, I told him I thought it could cause problems, I said: Well, could you explain what you thought you implied?</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.360" offset="13179212">And the teacher said: Well, I think by saying that it could cause problems and raise eyebrows, I also realized that the speech was indeed ambiguous and could be interpreted a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.883" offset="13213380">So rather than debate with Matt the morality and profanity in it, I thought it might be best to just point out or at last try to reason that it could indeed cause problems as far as his remaining few weeks at the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.856" offset="13253191">I didn't know what the consequences could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.558" offset="13264058">And indeed, the teacher does not administer the discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.177" offset="13274507">But when you read, a fair reading of the record, when you realize this is ten minutes before the speech, when these teachers had other students present, I think that they went... their comments could not be construed as giving this student license to say anything he wants to say at that assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.437" offset="13339604">I want to respond first to Justice Powell's question, is this political speech?</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.541" offset="13363950">And Justice Powell, I'd refer you to this Court's decision in Conick versus Meyers, and in that case the Court considered speech between an assistant district attorney, or actually a petition an assistant district attorney circulated in the office, and she was fired as a result of that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.385" offset="13431346">And this Court in considering that case said that there was only one question in that petition that had any public significance and the rest of it was just an internal communication within the office, and that this Court should not involve itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.793" offset="13484949">We would suggest to you that that case applies here, that there is no big political issue being discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.549" offset="13512012">It was a crude joke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.399" offset="13519431">Secondly, I want to follow up on Mr. Justice Renquist's question about, does it make any difference is this is a classroom or an assembly?</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.190" offset="13558615">And I would suggest to you that it's not up to Mr. Fraser to determine the school district's curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.260" offset="13586827">And indeed, what the statute says is that a school district shall have an associated student body, and it's under the control and direction of the board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.033" offset="13617965">Now, if the board of directors concludes that the best educational environment is a school assembly, that that's the proper place to inculcate values, that that's the proper place to in fact allow the students to learn public discourse, that that does not change any of the factors which give school districts the authority to regulate the content of speech in a school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.831" offset="13713155">There is still the relationship of student to teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.267" offset="13726843">There are still other students around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.385" offset="13735307">Now, he tried to distinguish away the captive audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.421" offset="13747532">But I would suggest to you that what he's suggesting is that in order to participate in your school activities such as this, in your own school government, you should have to put up with this type of behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.145" offset="13794344">That's clearly not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.181" offset="13806569">Now going to the issue of notice and this Court's concern about a disruptive conduct rule, I think, first of all, it's important you understand how these rules are adopted, and I think the record is clear, first of all, that we do distribute student codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.373" offset="13871248">This is the total student code for Bethel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.725" offset="13884727">Mr. Fraser testified that it was available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.194" offset="13894549">Now, we can't force him to read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.584" offset="14760143">Now, once we're over that hurdle, and assuming this Court says yes, you can regulate this particular speech, the issue is then what's the effective way of doing it, should it have been a two day suspension or should we just talk to him, should it have been more, that seems to me to be an issue that the First Amendment does not dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.545" offset="14836002">The First Amendment was never designed to dictate curriculum or punishment in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.299" offset="14855019">I think that is something that's clearly vested in the discretion of the school officials, within the parameters of the due process rules under which we operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.155" offset="14894412">And when you look at the rule and you judge its content, I think it's important to note that in Washington the rules aren't drafted by lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.745" offset="14920744">We have a statute that requires that students, that parents and administrators actually work on our codes and adopt them; that the legislature has adopted a policy of participation of those who have the greatest stake in the educational outcome to actually work on these rules and adopt them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.920" offset="14989498">So when you look at the word "obscene", most of the people who are drafting this have never heard of Miller and California, I would suggest, and are not aware of the standards set forth therein; and that the district's hearing officer was correct in looking at its common and ordinary meaning, which includes indecent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.882" offset="15057312">And so I think that we would hope that you would look at the context of the school rules, realizing that they're not drafted by attorneys for attorneys.</text>
