            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="129513">Mr. Crawford, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_d_crawford" startTime="80.577" stopTime="588.777">
            <label>Mr. James D. Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="80.577" offset="451760">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="84.498" offset="467433">I filed a reply brief in support of the petition of certiorari for Robert Davidson because I anticipated two questions that this Court might address in the Daniels case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.322" offset="514767">I asked that the cases be set down together.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.446" offset="523231">The Court saw fit to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.055" offset="529709">Those two questions were the question of damages which might happen in some non-prison context, damages common to the non-prison context, and the question of whether the immunity was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.139" offset="602016">What makes the Davidson case a good solution or a good vehicle for the Court to solve those questions is that Robert Davidson was injured when prison officials negligently failed to look into his suggestion that another prisoner was going to attack him.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.132" offset="677980">The prisoner did, indeed, attack him and injured him seriously, plainly a prison negligent situation not otherwise common.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.691" offset="708177">It is also clear that in New Jersey there is simply no liability whatever when... to either a public entity or an official for an injury caused to one prisoner by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="769095">That would also be true, one inmate of a psychiatric institution to another, that sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.073" offset="793755">Accordingly, although I think that the Daniels case and the argument which you have heard in it solves the problems that face me and that perhaps this argument was unnecessary, I do want to address those issues and some other related issues which make this case a clear case in which the rules which this Court announced, I thought with unquestioned clarity in Parratt versus Taylor and in Palmer versus Hudson, apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.843" offset="916844">Indeed, I am intrigued with the theory that somehow losing a hobby kit or stealing a couple of papers from a prisoner's cell plainly implicates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.337" offset="970760">There is a deprivation of property there, but when a prisoner's face is repeatedly gouged with a fork so that the prisoner suffers damages which Judge Brotman thought could be compensated at $2,000 and which I am sure that is minimal compensation, that that is not a deprivation of liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.688" offset="1052262">I am intrigued particularly by Justice Stevens' question as to whether we are talking about substantive or procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.276" offset="1098551">And, I believe we are talking procedural due process but in a peculiar sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.040" offset="1121644">I think that prisoners, because of their circumstance, perhaps have a substantive right to procedural due process that is meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.553" offset="1159678">And, I say that because you work from a situation in which the prisoner has a right, not just from South v. Maryland, but from English and American cases stretching back well before the Constitution and coming forth in cases like Youngberg versus Romeo, where you recognize that people in custody simply are dependent upon their custodians, and because a prisoner at least, probably someone in a sheriff's care or in a psychiatric or institution for the retarded, can't do the things the rest of us do to protect ourselves from attacks by other prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.740" offset="1316413">I assume... The first thing I do is I run.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.567" offset="1331773">Maybe before I run I went out and I bought insurance to protect me from various things that might threaten me.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.969" offset="1361343">If I felt it was wise to do so, I might buy a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.702" offset="1376285">I suppose I could hire a guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.295" offset="1390600">I could certainly fight back and nobody is going to say to me you are one of two prisoners who is going to be put in solitary confinement for fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.727" offset="1432396">So, there are a lot of things that I do or you do or anyone in this courtroom does to protect against threats of attack from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.974" offset="1469386">They are not open to prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.441" offset="1479208">And, for that reason, it is clear that, just as the state must make some kind of a meaningful remedy available for lost hobby kits that come through the mail, that the state certainly must have some sort of a procedure that says when prison authorities are warned that one prisoner is going to attack another prisoner and they forget to do anything about it, the prisoner can look to relief from the court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.868" offset="1584951">Normally what you do, and I think the civilized... That is unfair to New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.352" offset="1602819">What you would do in those states which do not have extreme sovereign immunity doctrines, states which haven't done what New Jersey did, and Judge Gibbons, an opinion that is full of learned language and obscure ideas, says what is peculiar to the New Jersey sovereign immunity statute is that it is introduced with a clause that says you can't give the state a duty to do everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.277" offset="1722564">Sovereign immunity isn't here because we are going to absolve the state from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.554" offset="1747642">In New Jersey peculiarly we actually absolve the state from duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.819" offset="1764778">And, it seems to me that if the Fourteenth Amendment did nothing else, it gave the state a duty to protect life, liberty, and property and says that a state cannot deprive anyone of those without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.969" offset="1837294">And, when New Jersey decided to take that duty away, it seems to me they did it in an unconstitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.104" offset="1865924">The Solicitor General makes much of the fact that my client, who was filling out a form... and this Court has seen plenty of the forms that come up through the prison system... filling out the form of complaint when he wanted relief, didn't say he wanted the statute held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.381" offset="1934992">So, plainly he was satisfied with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.770" offset="1944501">He said, I have been injured and I want relief which I can't get elsewhere, so please give me that relief and whatever other relief is appropriate to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.594" offset="1987864">I suppose appropriate relief might well have been to strike down the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.452" offset="2003224">I did not think it was necessary when I argued this case in the Third Circuit and I am the first lawyer that my client got to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.338" offset="2034780">I thought that Parratt versus Taylor made it very clear that you could have that kind of a statute, but you couldn't take away relief from the prisoner who brought a case to redress that deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.318" offset="2086711">If I have erred, I suppose the case should go back down for a determination as to whether the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.284" offset="2114610">That seems to me an inappropriate way to use the Court's time now when the question framed repeatedly on whether negligence can give rise to a 1983 action is here and is here under exactly those circumstances which allow it to be decided once and for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.651" offset="2188066">The deprivation question which troubled Justice O'Connor at the beginning of the preceding argument, it seems to me, could come down either way if you were construing language.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.738" offset="2264449">I would assume if the state were building a highway across the back of my property and the engineer designed it properly and said I am going to have to take the back two acres... I don't have two acres... but assume a large property to go with it... going to have to take the back two acres, the state would compensate me.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.698" offset="2344279">If they, on the other hand, had hired an engineer who said I can save you a lot of money, I will design you a cheaper highway, and he only took one acre off the back of my property, I am compensated for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.787" offset="2392657">Then the fill is put in and, of course, the first rain storm it flows over the additional acre, because he negligently has designed a highway that takes two acres of my property and pretended it was a one-acre piece of property that needed to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.780" offset="2456605">That would be a taking and I would go to court and I would get compensation because the property was negligently taken.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="588.777" stopTime="601.131">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="588.777" offset="2484609">There you could argue that the state actor did, in a general sense, intend the taking and meet a general intent requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_d_crawford" startTime="601.131" stopTime="664.169">
            <label>Mr. James D. Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="601.131" offset="2534032">I suppose, Justice O'Connor... I can't say and I wouldn't say that the prison authorities here intended that Robert Davidson have his face chopped up with at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.658" offset="2584083">But, I think that their duty toward Davidson says that if they aren't careful of him in a prison situation, that they have deprived him of rights, because the only way somebody locked up with a bunch of prisoners, many of them violent, can have any liberty at all is if the prison authorities undertake what I think is their clear duty of protection and that is a common law duty that is in state law, it is in federal law, it antidotes Swift versus Tyson, it antidotes both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.659" offset="2724099">And, for that reason, I would say here there is a deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.111" offset="2741862">This is why I, like Mr. Saltzburg, don't see 1983 action showing up when police officers drive down the streets, or as I was asked in the course of the oral argument in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="681.068" offset="2853771">How the body politic deals with the question of whether private citizens hit by police cars or ambulances are going to be compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.034" offset="2889611">It works in that whole political system we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.829" offset="2900791">The people who are walking the streets vote, they are also taxpayers, and they make decisions with their government as to what is going to go on about compensating ambulance accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.090" offset="2941856">You don't need a federal court action there.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.261" offset="2954499">I don't think it would foreclose one, but you certainly don't need one, and you can distinguish it.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.365" offset="3782894">Petitioner here suffered physical injury as a result of a deliberate act by a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.862" offset="3808912">He now makes a two-part argument here in order to assess liability against the state under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.952" offset="3845275">He argues first that because Respondents' negligence was in some tort sense law way, causally related to that physical injury; that, therefore, the state has deprived the Petitioner of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.694" offset="3924269">The second part of his argument is that that deprivation was without due process simply because the New Jersey state legislature made a decision to immunize negligent conduct for inner-prisoner injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.000" offset="3981425">Respondents urge this Court to reject both parts of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.747" offset="4004413">While it is necessary for this Court to reject only one, either one of those parts, and still affirm the judgment in favor of the Respondents by the Third Circuit, we would urge this Court to send out a clear message that, first of all, negligence does not equal a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and, secondly, even when their is a deprivation because the conduct has been worse than negligent, that there is not a deprival of due process simply because of the existence of an immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.391" offset="4143071">There is no such per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.390" offset="4151012">I would like to begin with the first of those two issues, namely, the question of whether negligence equals a deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.184" offset="4178179">Justice O'Connor has asked on a couple of occasions now about this very question; that is it seems to me that behind the question is does deprivation mean simply some kind of causal relationship or does it mean more than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.177" offset="4250173">Respondents would suggest that it means far more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.597" offset="4263861">We would adopt the definition that was given by Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in Parratt versus Taylor; namely, that deprivation means some kind of an intentional act to deny something to somebody or a deliberate decision to not act to prevent a loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.647" offset="4384024">Justice Rehnquist, I do not think that the Court rejected it in the specific sense that it was a part of the holding of the case in Parratt versus Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.284" offset="4426551">Respondents are well aware that there is language in Parratt versus Taylor to the effect that the alleged loss, though negligently caused, amounted to a deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.748" offset="4468452">However, that language was not crucial to or a fundamental part of the holding in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.713" offset="4500321">And, Respondents say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.244" offset="4506486">The Court in Parratt versus Taylor framed the issue as to whether negligence would support a claim for relief under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.288" offset="4538564">The answer was no in that case and rightly so, because what the Court saw there was what Taylor had conceded from the outside which was that there was a state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.502" offset="4591436">He had simply chosen not to go into state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.407" offset="4603139">There was a state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.140" offset="4610035">Nebraska took care of that and as a result of that, even if there had been a deprivation, even if all of the prerequisites for a due process claim had been made, there still would not have been a deprivation without due process and, therefore, no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.679" offset="5300191">But, what we are saying in this case is that this Court need not go that far if it does not want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.302" offset="5322656">It can limit its analysis to due process claims which is the precise claim being made here and then one needs to focus on the language of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.501" offset="5363511">That language has the word "deprive" in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.156" offset="5374065">And, what Respondents say is that negligence never amounts to a deprivation because it is not this intentional act, it is not deliberately doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.465" offset="5415338">It is the very antithesis of the whole purpose of the Due Process Clause from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.478" offset="5435400">That was designed to deal with petty tyranny, to deal with oppression, to deal with situations in which the government would go through the streets and take people off the streets and put them into prison and take away their liberty in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.660" offset="5488063">And, even there the government has the right to do that providing it provides due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.846" offset="5504886">But, the Due Process Clause has always been meant to deal with intentional acts, with something far more than simply negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.625" offset="5535920">And, both this Petitioner and the Petitioner in the other case argue that if negligence can ever be a deprivation within the Due Process Clause, it surely can here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.634" offset="5587955">Petitioners have that argument backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.758" offset="5596524">People who go into prison don't gain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.789" offset="5612615">They may not lose all of their rights as we well know, but they don't gain new ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.052" offset="5633617">Instead, they retain, as this Court said in Hudson versus Palmer, those rights which are consistent and compatible with incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.158" offset="5670084">In Hudson, this Court found that the right to privacy within one's cell was not compatible with incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.216" offset="5714284">Respondents would urge here that the right being asserted by the Petitioner is the right to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.010" offset="5745526">Specifically, they are urging, although perhaps not articulating, the right to absolute safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.757" offset="5764439">Respondents say that the right to absolute safety in a prison setting is not compatible with incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.441" offset="5795263">Yes, we have a duty to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.770" offset="5804563">Yes, we have a duty to exercise some reasonable care and it is only because we breach that duty that we were found to be negligent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.589" offset="6355851">But, with reference to this question of whether duty goes simply to negligence or goes to something more, since the Petitioner is really saying that he has a right to safety, that is precisely the claim made by the prisoner in Smith versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.581" offset="6423769">In that case, the Court found... This Court specifically said that if the prison guard had been simply negligent, that there would not be any cause of action there because of the need to protect prison guards in their day-to-day decisions in running a correctional institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.494" offset="6511436">In Smith versus Wade, as it turned out, the conduct of the prison guard was worse than merely negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.647" offset="6540066">It was deliberately indifferent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.397" offset="6547067">He knew or should have know what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.567" offset="6555740">And, in that instance, this Court recognized the cause of action and rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.988" offset="6573399">Smith versus Wade was analyzed under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.955" offset="6593252">This Court ought not to take the very same claim of a right to safety against injury by another prisoner, analyze it under a different constitutional portion as the Due Process Clause and apply some lesser standard as the Petitioner would have them do of mere negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.586" offset="6683844">That would not be consistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.857" offset="7556857">They are inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.528" offset="7563544">They were rightly decided, but they have nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.433" offset="7575142">One is Ingraham versus Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.026" offset="7585591">That stands for the proposition that the government can't hold somebody and punish them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.539" offset="7603668">We agree with that, but that is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.414" offset="7615162">The second is Youngberg versus Romeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.898" offset="7625089">There the Court found that an involuntarily committed person had a liberty interest in safety but that liberty interest was in being free from injury 63 times over a two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.345" offset="7682871">But, in both of those cases this Court said if the plaintiff had been a prisoner, then the question would have been whether it was cruel and unusual punishment because that was the issue that was presented and the Court rejected it because the plaintiffs were not prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.025" offset="7745565">Here, the plaintiff is a prisoner and Respondents would urge that the only right to safety they have is a right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and if it doesn't reach that level, there is no interest in safety that is recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.974" offset="7797392">Finally, on the issue of the immunities, if this Court were to determine that immunities are always... automatically means that there is no due process, you will negate tort immunity, you will call them all into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.095" offset="7849846">You may even call into question the judicially created immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.482" offset="7863430">You will deprive states of the right to fashion their own tort laws to the right expressly recognized in Martinez versus California, providing that that statute is rationale, is not arbitrary, and in this case this statute is, indeed, rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.678" offset="7936155">It is, in fact, a portion of the very same statute that was in Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.068" offset="7953709">And, in addition to that, the New Jersey courts have... the legislature has indicated that they recognized the practical problems inherent in supervising prisoners and in particular in preventing injuries caused by one prisoner upon another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.031" offset="8009611">They realized the problems in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.436" offset="8019224">So, the decision that they have made is that if you are merely negligent, then you will not be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.417" offset="8047123">However, there is another provision in the same act that says if your act is willful misconduct, actual crime, actual fraud, actual malice, if it is any of those, no immunity applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.147" offset="8098009">And, basically what New Jersey legislature has done is that we recognize that negligence doesn't equal a deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.097" offset="8129879">It is perfectly proper to pass this kind of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.313" offset="8146702">But, if the conduct gets so bad that it is willful misconduct, we will not protect those people, we will not provide them with any immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.295" offset="8178675">So, in conclusion, we urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Third Circuit, either by finding that there was no liberty interest in the first place because the Eighth Amendment claim was rejected, or if there was a liberty interest, that the negligent conduct here did not amount to a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.241" offset="8254431">And, finally, that the Petitioner is also wrong in saying that the existence of the immunity automatically means that there is no due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.951" offset="8345232">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.572" offset="8359756">If I may, before I enter the details of what we consider to be the defects in Petitioner's claim, may I suggest a more distant perspective on this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.725" offset="8412315">A hundred years ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes began the common law by insisting on a distinction which he said was so basic that it is part between being stumbled over and being kicked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.233" offset="8478352">In this case, Respondent can at most be said to have stumbled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.309" offset="8510744">If anyone kicked Petitioner, it was his fellow prisoner, McMillian, against whom, of course, Davidson retains a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.647" offset="8560063">The majestic purpose of the Due Process Clause, we suggest, is trivialized for it was intended to protect against oppression and there is no oppression here where a state officer has at most stumbled whether or not the state offers a complete remedy for the harm which is occasioned by that stumbling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.463" offset="8671345">Now, turning to the details, Petitioner claims there is a denial of procedural due process and I think we should try to keep distinct whether the claim is a procedural or a substantive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.442" offset="8731217">Petitioner claimed, or at least so it seemed from the papers, claimed there is a denial of procedural due process because of the existence of the state immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.453" offset="8779283">If that argument is correct, then every state limitation on liability, every gap in the complete garment of compensation gives rise to a due process violation, including such familiar limitations on liability as automobile guest statutes, no fault statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.333" offset="8870816">More remarkably still Petitioner's argument would put under a constitutional doubt limitations on liabilities, gaps in liabilities which have been established by this Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.015" offset="8937480">And, I think most strikingly of Chapel and Wallace in which this Court said that there is ground for grave hesitation before allowing a soldier to bring a cause of action against a military superior and denied the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.663" offset="9012086">And, I think some of the reasoning in Chapel and Wallace, some of the balancing of interest there is very similar to the balancing of interest which occasioned the New Jersey legislature to find immunity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.235" offset="9070391">It is our suggestion that that process of establishing an immunity where there seems to be good reasons for doing so cannot of itself create a procedural due process claim.</text>
