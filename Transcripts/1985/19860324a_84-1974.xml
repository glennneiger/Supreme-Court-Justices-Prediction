            <text syncTime="59.490" offset="373316">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.454" offset="393169">On the night of December 30, 1978, Joy Faulk and Charles Browning were shot to death in a rural area of Rutherford County, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.232" offset="440294">The Respondent Clark was indicted by the grand jury on two counts of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.027" offset="467462">Following a jury trial, he was convicted of the first degree murder of Joy Faulk and given life imprisonment and the second degree murder of Charles Browning and given ten years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.298" offset="520542">The malice instructions were not challenged at trial, but later challenged on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.980" offset="543217">The state appellate court affirmed the jury verdict and the Tennessee Supreme Court denied permission to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.865" offset="574773">The petition for the writ of habeas corpus, which alleged the malice instructions violated due process pursuant to Sandstrom versus Montana, was granted by the district court and this affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.226" offset="644258">This grant of the petition for a writ of certiorari is limited to the question of whether error in the trial court's jury instructions on malice was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.745" offset="702355">The facts in this case are extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.576" offset="713640">Joy Faulk and the Respondent had been involved in a stormy relationship prior to Faulk terminating that relationship several months before the slayings.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.984" offset="759302">Following their breakup, the Respondent threatened on six different occasions to kill Faulk if he ever caught her with another man.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.850" offset="794724">Two weeks before the slayings, the Respondent borrowed the murder weapon, a 25 caliber automatic pistol, after untruthfully indicating that his own gun had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.879" offset="842893">Several days before the slayings, the Respondent spoke to Browning's wife for the purpose of determining the relationship and during the course of the conversation he twice stated that he wanted to find out about Browning and Faulk's relationship before he did what he had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.932" offset="919066">And, at the time he made those statements, he was in the possession of the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.225" offset="940278">Now, prior to the commission of the crimes, the Respondent's truck was observed pursuing Browning's truck in which Faulk and her two daughters were passengers along the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.514" offset="993359">Some ten miles from this observation, Browning pulled into a private driveway, either to let the Respondent pass or to seek safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.500" offset="1037349">At that time, the Respondent parked his truck immediately behind Browning's, thereby blocking any escape, and left the lights on, then immediately went to the Browning truck, put his pistol inside the cab and fired the weapon at least four times at point-blank range.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.214" offset="1120209">Browning, who was, of course, the driver of the truck, had a fully loaded 22 caliber pistol in his right pants pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.440" offset="1161065">The pistol contained one spent cartridge which the evidence is clear was positioned so that it could not have just been fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.896" offset="1198890">He could not have removed the pistol from his pocket before he was shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.670" offset="1221982">Browning was shot once in the head from a distance of six to eight inches and Faulk was shot three times, twice in the head and once in the left shoulder, from a distance of less than 18 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.333" offset="1288647">Both Browning's and Faulk's brains were obliterated by the head wounds in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.006" offset="1315396">Physical evidence at the scene indicated that the Respondent fired his weapon almost immediately after causing Browning to stop his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.913" offset="1358969">Browning's foot was still on the brake pedal.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.634" offset="1373911">The motor in the truck was on, the radio was playing, the headlights were on, the driver's window was down, and the passenger's window was up.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.661" offset="1405989">And, finally, after the Respondent fled the scene of the murder, Faulk's two daughters who miraculously not injured in the shooting, crawled over the bodies and were found wandering around the roadway seeking assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.831" offset="1470668">Shortly thereafter the Respondent led the police on a high-speed chase at which time he discarded the murder weapon prior to his apprehension by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.411" offset="1525003">That night and at the trial, Joy Faulk's daughter identified the Respondent as the individual responsible for killing her mother and Browning.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.169" offset="1572023">Now, the primarily issue litigated at the trial of this case was the identity of the murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.114" offset="1603788">The Respondent sought to prove that someone else did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.177" offset="1620089">He mentioned two other individuals that he thought did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.718" offset="1634195">But, given the overwhelming evidence that he had committed the murder, the Respondent, who did not testify, also attempted to say that if he did it he was temporarily insane, he was voluntarily intoxicated, he had amnesia and didn't remember it at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.032" offset="1727504">The jury instructions given in this case by the trial judge were extensive and went into the first and second degree murders and the elements of those offenses, told the jury to consider the instructions as a whole, that the state had the burden of proof, the Defendant had the presumption of innocence, but the court gave the two Sandstrom type instructions, one which said homicides are presumed to be malicious in the absence of evidence to rebut, but that rebuttal evidence could be direct or circumstantial and either from the state or from the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.128" offset="1883821">And, secondly, if a deadly weapon is used under certain circumstances, then malice could be presumed to support a second degree murder conviction unless it is rebutted by other facts and circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.531" offset="1949440">General Cody, would you say that the instructions here were like those in the case of Connecticut versus Johnson and were conclusive presumptions or were these instructions, in your view, rebuttable presumptions?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="476.504" offset="2041391">That had the effect of maybe shifting the burden to the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.828" offset="2058632">--Justice, I think very clearly they were rebuttable presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.580" offset="2077649">I do not believe there is any contention made that this was a conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.584" offset="2101682">The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals held that these instructions did not violate Sandstrom and, further, that the Respondent could not have been prejudiced in view of his sole defenses of non-participation and insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.045" offset="2171481">The federal district court, however, found that the element of malice was a disputed issue at trial because of the defenses and refused to find it harmless.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="520.305" stopTime="525.167">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="520.305" offset="2216516">Did you tell us, Mr. Attorney General, that there was no objection to the instructions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_j_michael_cody" startTime="525.167" stopTime="609.584">
            <label>Mr. W. J. Michael Cody</label>
            <text syncTime="525.167" offset="2236056">There were no objections whatsoever to the instructions during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.561" offset="2257581">The error was not alleged in the motion for a new trial, but some three months after the trial in a supplemental motion for a new trial the error was then claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.619" offset="2317767">The Sixth Circuit, as I indicated, agreed with the district court and declined to reverse the district court despite its findings of the substantial evidence of the Defendant's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.269" offset="2376386">And, the Sixth Circuit indicated in its opinion that were it not for its prior precedent that it would inquire itself as to whether the evidence of malice was so dispositive of intent to be able to say that the jury would have found it unnecessary to rely on the presumption in determining whether the erroneous instructions prejudiced the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.375" offset="2472830">But, they felt bound by earlier precedent, primarily, we believe, based upon the Kohler case out of Michigan which allowed a diminished capacity defense to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.246" offset="2532284">It is a proper defense in Michigan but it is not a proper defense in Tennessee, and, of course, was not charged in these jury instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.875" offset="2582857">As I understand it, with respect to one of the killings, he was convicted of first degree murder and with respect to the other it was second degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.580" offset="2617653">The first degree murder was the murder of Joy Faulk, the woman who was shot twice in the head and once in the shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.896" offset="2662897">And, of course, this was the Respondent's former girlfriend who he had said, if I ever catch you out with someone I will kill you.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.061" offset="2695602">Browning, which was the second degree murder conviction... It was based upon that he was the person that she was found with on that occasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.928" offset="2739070">I take it the harmless error inquiry would be whether there was no possibility or no reasonable possibility that the first degree murder conviction might have been a second degree murder conviction?</text>

          <turn speaker="w_j_michael_cody" startTime="662.798" stopTime="808.271">

            <text syncTime="662.798" offset="2786508">I think the inquiry could go to both, but I believe that it is very clear in this case that the overwhelming... First of all, on the first degree charge, there is no question that premeditation and deliberation and willfulness were all properly charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.211" offset="2880235">And, under Tennessee law, voluntary intoxication, for instance, is not a defense to second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.806" offset="2906567">It is only a defense to premeditation and deliberation aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.010" offset="2923390">So, we believe that any jury which, under these facts, would have found that the murder was committed premeditatively and deliberately and wilfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.629" offset="2981904">Under these facts, multiple shots within the cab of the truck at point-blank range would have also found malice and could have certainly not have been harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.996" offset="3035298">Now, maybe the court... In response to your question, belatedly the Respondent in this Court for the first time has raised a self-defense claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.527" offset="3089424">Self-defense was never raised anywhere below, it was never argued, it was never charged to find, but certainly with respect to the first degree murder of Joy Faulk, who didn't even have a pistol in her pocket and was sitting on the far side of the truck... both victims were seated... there could be no indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.961" offset="3179181">If the Court please, the State of Tennessee submits first that the jury instructions in this case which incorporate a rebuttable presumption on the element of malice alone, are subject to analysis under the harmless error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.516" offset="3265385">Second, that the existence of malice was not placed in dispute by either of the two defenses raised by the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.112" offset="3307808">And, third and finally, in any event, the evidence of malice in this case, on the facts and the entire trial, is overwhelming and that the Respondent was not prejudiced by the instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.194" offset="3680105">And, we believe if the Court analyzes the record in this case and the evidence and defenses presented that it would find a harmless error clearly and reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.352" offset="3796715">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="919.045" offset="3811553">The Court has often recognized the harmless error doctrine serves salutary purposes in the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.580" offset="3837675">It is also clear from the Court's decisions that an erroneous jury instruction may generally be analyzed for its harmlessness in the particular facts of a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.426" offset="3873097">The question here is whether the Court ought to create an exception from those rules for instructions that have an erroneous presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.781" offset="3902459">In this case, the presumption is rebuttable, but the Court has looked at both rebuttal and conclusive presumptions in the cases preceding this one such as Sandstrom and Connecticut versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.606" offset="3941747">It is our position there is no reason to adopt the per se rule in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.561" offset="3961600">And, it is also our position that the analysis that the Court followed in United States versus Frady directly controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.723" offset="3986260">The question in Frady came up in the context of whether or not the Defendant had been prejudiced because he hadn't objected at trial to the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.590" offset="4017711">But, the question of whether the Defendant is prejudiced is simply the flip side of the question of whether the error is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.974" offset="4039236">So, the analysis the Court followed in Frady should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.886" offset="4054910">Two aspects of the decision in Frady are quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.889" offset="4070897">First, the Court found no difficulty in analyzing the record to decide whether or not Frady, in fact, had been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.504" offset="4101408">And, second, the Court found that for three related reasons he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.905" offset="4118962">The first was that the government's proof in that case of malice was overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.956" offset="4187194">That is also the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.341" offset="4148742">The second reason was the erroneous instruction did not affect the defense in that case of non-participation that Frady had raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.999" offset="4195344">Neither the defense of non-participation, voluntarily intoxication, insanity or amnesia could have been affected by this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.034" offset="4231497">And, finally, the last reason given in Frady why the error there was not prejudicial was that the jury found that Frady had premeditated and deliberated and that, too, is the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.887" offset="4370887">The question analyzing Frady was whether the erroneous instruction had affected the verdict in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.031" offset="4399517">The Court was able to find that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.804" offset="4410593">The Court gave a variety of different reasons for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.535" offset="4421460">Those are the same types of reasons that should apply in a case such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.608" offset="4437760">Now, as Frady demonstrates, the error that occurs in a case like this with an erroneous instruction of this type, is not a fundamental defect in the trial process that completely deprives someone of a semblance of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.587" offset="4497737">The instructions given in this case have been used in Tennessee murder prosecutions since the time of Andrew Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.471" offset="4521248">They were used elsewhere nationwide, both in state and federal cases, for some time thereafter, and this Court had even approved a similar type of instruction in the Allen case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1107.918" offset="4567014">Not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.250" offset="4572343">The rationale that we understand the Court to have adopted in Sandstrom is that there is a risk that the jury may misconstrue these types of instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.256" offset="4608392">But, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily to be equated with a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.948" offset="4627096">Instructions like this take place along a continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.500" offset="4637336">At one end of the continuum is an instruction that allows a jury to infer an ultimate fact from a basic fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.885" offset="4662831">The Court has never found any constitutional problem with that type of instruction so long as the evidence is sufficient to support it and so long as the type of inference the jury is allowed to draw is one that is entirely rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.142" offset="4711942">At the other end of the spectrum is a case where you have an actual directed verdict, either in whole as where the case is not allowed to go to the jury at all, or in part where the case is allowed to go to the jury on one or more issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.742" offset="4762306">The problem with an instruction like the type that was found in Sandstrom is not that it necessarily amounts to a directed verdict, it is just that there is some risk that the jury may misconstrue how it should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.800" offset="4810580">But, where the evidence is overwhelming, it seems to us quite unlikely that the jury is not going to be swayed by that type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.333" offset="4840673">If it is a problem of uncertainty, certainly isn't present where there are other findings by the jury that are untainted by the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.888" offset="4874841">For example, in Frady, there was a finding of premeditation and deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.882" offset="4890828">That is also the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.022" offset="4899396">The erroneous presumption in this case affected only the instruction on malice, not the instructions on willfulness premeditation and deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.419" offset="4928967">The additional findings the jury made in this case, therefore, show that they necessarily found malice regardless of whether or not the error was brought to their attention or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.665" offset="4977973">Secondly, it is also not the type of error where an inquiry is inherently impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.860" offset="5002737">This Court was able to make that type of inquiry in Frady and the lower courts, both state and federal, have found that they are able to distinguish cases where there are erroneous presumptions, conclusive or rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.509" offset="5057385">They are able to distinguish the cases where they are harmless from the cases where they are prejudicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.904" offset="5082985">It is pretty much the same question I asked before, but are you saying it is perfectly clear that they would have found him not guilty or they could not have found a murder one conviction to be a murder two conviction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.104" offset="5139723">That is the thing that puzzles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.253" offset="5144320">I would have thought the evidence is overwhelming as to murder one on both victims, but the jury apparently didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.326" offset="5168666">Well, I would explain that the same way the trial judge explained it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.588" offset="5181728">Page 132 in the record contains the trial judge's order denying the motion for a new trial and making sentences consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.623" offset="5213806">There he said he found that there were two cold-blooded killings, one premeditated and the other flowing out of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.751" offset="5254348">It seems to me what happened here in this case was the jury thought that the killing of Faulk was premeditated, probably largely because there had been numerous threats made by the Respondent that he would kill her if he found her with another man and also because she was shot multiple times and Browning was shot only once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.274" offset="5328431">Now, the evidence would be sufficient to support premeditation and deliberation as to both, but what probably accounts for what happened here is just that the jury thought premeditation and deliberation probably requires thinking about it for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.349" offset="5428742">Well, there was no basis in the other jury instructions for allowing them to reduce the second degree murder verdict to manslaughter which require provocation and passion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.107" offset="5467821">As the Attorney General discussed, Browning was found in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.110" offset="5483808">His foot was on the brake pedal, his gun was in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.292" offset="5496555">It hadn't just been fired where the empty cylinder was located showed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.712" offset="5514214">He was shot once through the head instantaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.444" offset="5525081">It is clear that there was no evidence presented to support the claim that there was a manslaughter or self-defense theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.339" offset="5556742">The only evidence of any type that the Respondent offered in this respect was a statement that Mitzi Faulk, six-year old daughter of Joy Faulk, had made, to the two people who picked her up that night after the killing, in which she said they were fighting, Clicker and Browning had guns and they were fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.131" offset="5627899">On the stand, Mitzi denied that there was any type of fight there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.714" offset="5642214">So, the only evidence he has that would justify anything less than a second degree murder conviction was this one particular type of hearsay statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.814" offset="5762586">Also, the two people who were supposed to have committed this crime, Joy Faulk's ex-husband, Sam, and Charles Browning's wife, were both seen by several witnesses at a bar for the entire evening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.792" offset="6322547">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.423" offset="6341042">The Petitioner takes the position based upon a view of the facts which I think Justice Marshall's last question kind of pinpointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.432" offset="6397049">They view the facts only in their view of how it had to be from their standpoint of looking at it rather than looking at it in a multitude of ways in which a jury can consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.869" offset="6434769">If they are arguing sufficiency of evidence, that is one thing, but they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.013" offset="6451383">That is not the point here raised at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.665" offset="6462041">And, before I go into the matters that I want to specifically address for the point of view of my own presentation, are some matters which the Petitioner has stated here which I think need to be touched upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.525" offset="6525466">First of all, they said the malice instruction was not challenged at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.758" offset="6538423">I think this is pointed out clearly in the briefs and the record that under Tennessee law you are not required to object to the instructions at the time it is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.723" offset="6574263">It is proper to object to them under the rules by including that in your motion for a new trial which we did appropriately and timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.209" offset="6616164">The Court of Appeals acknowledging this, then considered the matter and heard it on the merits with regard to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.424" offset="6641032">So, there is no question about any waiver aspects here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.384" offset="6648869">Now, they have stated here as to the facts, their view of the facts, and just to give you an illustration, they say someone was following them for ten miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.402" offset="6696934">The only evidence of what was going on was that the... There was nothing done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.988" offset="6731311">The police officer saw the cars, didn't pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.451" offset="6741133">There wasn't any high speed chase at that time, there wasn't anything going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.102" offset="6755762">He simply followed and said he didn't see any reason to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.341" offset="6928693">We concede it was great evidence, substantial evidence viewed from one standpoint, but not so overwhelming as to dictate the result, and clearly, I think, is the indication of Justice Marshall's question a moment ago, it shows the conclusions could not be that concrete as the Petitioner takes the position of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.376" offset="7020853">Now, what we suggest and what we have submitted throughout the case is... And, they state again that the primary issue at trial was that someone else did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.813" offset="7066619">Let me explain that at the trial, my client, Mr. Clark, through the testimony of two psychiatrists who testified in his behalf, was found to have amnesia, such that they said, first of all, we don't know if he was there, but we are convinced that he doesn't know if he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.046" offset="7139553">If he was there, he has absolutely no recollection of having anything to do with the events here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.030" offset="7167452">So, that is the evidence that we offered and which we presented at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.603" offset="7181767">I don't believe there is any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.844" offset="7190753">They said that if, in fact, he committed the crimes he was not guilty by reason of insanity and this was the defense we relied upon as well as the fact that we, from the outset, contended, number one, Mr. Clark, the Defendant, had no recollection of the events, had insanity, therefore could not present an alternative version out of his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.422" offset="7305065">The only witness to it was a little girl, a six-year old girl, whose testimony, by the statement of the trial judge, was so contractive and impeached, and he said impeached, that he allowed into evidence out-of-court statements that she had made in which she had said specifically, and there are other witnesses who agreed, that they are fighting, they have guns, they are fighting, so that there was clearly a fight going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.297" offset="9412520">But, in that case, they have now conceded that even though premeditation is found specifically, that premeditation was clearly proved in the Martin case, but that this was not sufficient to dictate a finding of malice and it reversed on the issue of malice while finding premeditation was fully established even though there were substantial eye-witnesses to it, because it held that malice is a separate issue and that malice in order to be found cannot be presumed under its view of the law now and that since it cannot be presumed it found that this was a separate issue which must be tried by the jury upon proper instructions irrespective of whether the evidence with regard to premeditation was clearly sufficient and that is what it found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.778" offset="9602482">So, we submit to the Court that the Tennessee Court, even now by its own findings, by its own determination, has reached the position that we have taken throughout.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.208" offset="11668141">There were some other aspects of that which I have gone into at length in the brief and I won't go into all of that, but at any rate that much it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.082" offset="11699697">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.342" offset="11704712">It was, according to the testimony, loaned to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.878" offset="11734805">We, again, submit that the controlling rule here is the fact that we have right to rely upon the presumption of innocence and that the Court cannot, in keeping with the process and justices that have been followed by this Court throughout, say that in essence directing a verdict on an issue that is contested in a case and where they Defendant cannot, due to his mental condition, is unable to, assuming he even was there, testify, present evidence, rule that he was obligated to rebut this type of evidence as the instruction would require him to do and it was denied the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.922" offset="11938978">The presumption of innocence, if we had had that alone... simply go into court and say we want to rely on a presumption of innocence, that that presumption alone should have been enough to allow us to make the jury confront the issues head on without a presumption telling them what they are supposed to do unless we rebut it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.192" offset="12012121">And, that really gets down to the crux of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.114" offset="12023824">Although we think we have a much stronger say as the trial... district judge and the other judges in the Sixth Circuit pointed out, we nevertheless submit that to adopt the position taken by the Petitioner in this case is simply do away with the presumption of innocence in a case where there was strong evidence and allow the court simply to take a position that, well, all right, we don't think there is enough evidence and there is strong evidence on this, it really makes no difference to us whether or not this issue... the jury was allowed to fairly consider this issue without placing the burden to rebut it on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.820" offset="12178573">And, under this posture, we just don't think that the position taken by the Solicitor General or by the Petitioner in general can be a proper position to be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.109" offset="12227788">Finally, in closing, I will simply state that we submit that that is one issue that this Court doesn't need to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.083" offset="12255687">That it simply is a matter that that issue has already been properly and fairly decided by the district court and the Sixth Circuit and that the presumption that clearly was erroneous and clearly prejudicial to each of the defenses, which we attempted and feel like we did present at length at the trial.</text>
