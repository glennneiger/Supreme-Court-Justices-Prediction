            <text syncTime="91.339" offset="506667">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="94.853" offset="520773">We are here today because the individual Petitioners have suffered what we deem to be constitutional injury by being laid off on numerous occasions from their employment as tenured public school teachers with the Jackson School District in Jackson, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.608" offset="615755">The eight individual tenured teachers have, between 1976 and the present time, been laid off on a number of occasions from periods ranging from six weeks up to three years of no employment for Petitioner Wendy Wygant.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.021" offset="705407">Deborah Brezezinski, another one of the individual Petitioners, has been laid off eight times, eight separate times, during the past nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.627" offset="743859">The reasons for these layoffs are because of a race-based system for layoff contained in a labor contract between their employer and their union.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.683" offset="808016">We submit that this is an explicit use of race imposed and sponsored by the state itself, the local school board being an agent of the state, being a political subdivision of the State of Michigan, and as such we submit that it must be justified by the state and that justification must be of the most compelling nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.342" offset="926716">We submit to the Court that at a minimum where the state seeks to assign job benefits and burdens based upon race the burden is upon the state to show a state interest that has some remedial character and we say, number one, the state must identify an injury, identify a constitutional injury that must be remedied at the expense of the individual Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.516" offset="1067360">We say, number two, the state must show that the instrument or device or means chosen to remedy that identified discrimination are properly tailored to achieve that end and no other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.510" offset="1131307">Number three, we think at a minimum the state must do this before, not after, before it resorts to the use of race for determining job benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.034" offset="1197449">If the states does not do it before the use of race is assigned to determine job rights, how are the courts to review whether the use of race is a permissible constitutional objective and responds to a proper remedial purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.120" offset="1265786">So, the justification should not be ad hoc or ex post facto.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.680" offset="1292013">It should be done before the use of race is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.836" offset="1308627">Now, we say that the use of race in this case has no remedial character and as such amounts to a naked racial preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.750" offset="1372365">We say that because--</text>

            <text syncTime="309.906" offset="1380933">Mr. Farris, do you think that a school board has the right to look at its employees overall and to look at the number of black employees it has and the number of black employees available in that immediate area for employment in jobs in the school and conclude for itself that the school hasn't done as much as it should have to employ black employees and develop a program to implement some effort to hire more black employees?</text>

            <text syncTime="380.128" offset="1661802">We think that there are some differences between affirmative action recruiting and what an employer may do to incumbent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.903" offset="1720943">We think to take two public employees, one white and one black, and to treat them differently because of their race must, as I have said, bear a most extraordinary justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.395" offset="1794922">And, whether or not such a justification would be present in the abstract, I guess, is what your question goes to.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.387" offset="1874857">I think, Justice O'Connor, there are, for example, school desegregation cases where the courts have found that in order to remedy on-going constitutional violations in segregated school districts and in order to have effective desegregation that it may be necessary to make layoffs by race, but only if strictly necessary to remedy constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.829" offset="1992617">And, of course, there are no such constitutional violations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.030" offset="2009440">We say there is no balancing to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.169" offset="2021978">Individuals, says the Constitution, have a right to equal protection under the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.166" offset="2046011">If there is some injury that must be remedied or some other compelling constitutional value, then there is a balancing test to be done, but in this case before the Court, we plead in the complaint in the lower courts in paragraph 21 of our complaint that... and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="500.610" offset="2143709">"There has been no finding of past employer discrimination in the hiring of teacher personnel on the part of the Jackson School Board by a governmental agency competent to rule on such matters. "</text>

            <text syncTime="586.746" offset="2488316">Why would it not be a permissible objective of the school board and the union to do exactly what they said in the collective bargaining agreement; that there had been trouble in the schools and they thought a possible solution to their problems would be some diversity of the faculty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.472" offset="5359173">And, we think the very reason this case is before this Court is because you do not have findings of discrimination, either on an individual basis or on a group basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.735" offset="5396267">Getting back to the labor contract, the contract says nothing about hiring goals or timetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.903" offset="5432943">It says nothing about the school district's employment practices or procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.229" offset="5450184">What the contract is designed to do is achieve this racial balance and what Article XII is designed to do, as put by the district court, and again I quote... Article XII, to be clear, is the contract provision that assigns layoffs on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.173" offset="5530014">Based on the district court's findings which are on page 32A of our appendix to the petition,</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.092" offset="5569720">"the plan is designed to either, one, retain a sufficient number of minority teachers so that the racial composition of the Jackson School District faculty will roughly approximate that of the student body; or, two, if that ratio has not yet been achieved, then at least to prevent a reduction in the minority to majority ratio. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.799" offset="5672538">So, what we have is a racial preference designed to achieve a racial balance and a prohibition against laying off minority teachers if that would reduce the existing percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.200" offset="5730112">Why is that an impermissible objective, which Justice Stevens has inquired previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.667" offset="5763967">It is impermissible because there is no causal nexus or relationship between the percentage of minorities in the student body or the percentage of minority teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.363" offset="5822795">There are any number of reasons why you might have a certain percentage of minorities in the student population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.470" offset="5851216">It might reflect change in birth rates, it might reflect housing habits, it might reflect racial demographics, it might reflect parent choice, it might reflect population movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.604" offset="5907745">Any number of reasons can increase or decrease the percentage of minority students in a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.633" offset="5939823">Now, let's look at the percentage of minority teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.162" offset="5953929">What influences the percentage of minority teachers in a school district?</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.208" offset="5970125">The first and most important thing that influences the percentage is the supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.674" offset="5991964">What is the available supply of minority teachers who are available to be hired by any school district?</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.938" offset="6021116">Taking the number, the most recent data we have, we know that in 1979 and 1980 all Michigan colleges and universities graduated a certain percentage of minorities with education degrees, whether it is a Bachelor's, whether it is a Master's, whether it is a Ph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.288" offset="6102514">D, and assuming that every minority that gets an education degree wants to go into teaching, we know that the available supply of minority teachers is at most 11 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.612" offset="6147758">The school district cannot be expect to hire and retain more minority teachers than are available out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.654" offset="6191957">Yet they have an objective that says we have 27 percent minority students, we want 27 percent minority teachers, and until we get it we are going to deprive other tenured teachers of their civil rights in order to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.398" offset="6250889">That is why it is an impermissible constitutional objective.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome A. Susskind</label>
            <text syncTime="1886.957" offset="7689191">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.563" offset="7707582">By 1972, this Court had charged school boards to step up to their Fourteenth Amendment duties to end discrimination and integrate their schools, advising boards to evaluate the total facts and to review a wide range of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.026" offset="7773410">This is exactly what the Jackson Board did as a part of a comprehensive, four-year study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.523" offset="7799428">The Board knew that the district had discriminated against students and faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.350" offset="7818759">The Jackson Board further knew minority teachers would be necessary for faculty integration and were educationally essential to aid students who will live in the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.142" offset="7861913">The educational policy was sound and the governmental interest was compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.625" offset="7879781">Article XII was but a part of total integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.404" offset="7898902">It was arrived at bilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.137" offset="7909874">All the teachers' views were represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.792" offset="7920532">It is clearly designed so that the gains made would not be in vain and destroyed in the event of a decline in total student enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.101" offset="7957730">Article XII did not place the burden on any one group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.974" offset="7977165">It was believed by all the parties to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.035" offset="7989495">All parties' interests were represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.066" offset="8001616">The collective bargaining process itself was a significant safeguard because of its adversary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.547" offset="8027529">Article XII, which is part of the overall layoff language, takes race into account, however, it is the one part of a layoff clause which takes into account as well curriculum and program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.994" offset="8089283">Now, no animus on the part of the Board or the union has been alleged by the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.912" offset="8128989">There has been no allegation that this language was enacted to harm these Petitioners in particular or whites in general, this is part clearly of a remedial effort to cure the vestiges of discrimination and to enhance the educational opportunities of Jackson students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.186" offset="8202027">Now, the rights of employees were balanced against the needs of a sound educational system and were enacted by responsible parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.328" offset="8642661">Your Honor, there has been no judicial determination and it was a voluntary effort to integrate and there was no reason for a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.918" offset="8684979">That is correct for those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.480" offset="8691249">Now, let me also say as to the facts and the stipulated record, Justice Powell, that Jackson surely knew what was going on there, but didn't want to flail itself publicly either... Frankly, when we were establishing the stipulated record for this case and certainly not in the matter before Judge DeMascio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.583" offset="8759689">In that issue, it wasn't a question of asking the federal court to write this contract language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.596" offset="8783722">The contract language existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.658" offset="8791977">The characterization that because Jackson One occurred is somehow supportive to the Petitioners, I think, is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.998" offset="8821338">And, a reading of Judge DeMascio's opinion, I think, will support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.450" offset="8835131">One, no... As I say, they weren't attempting... The Plaintiffs in that case weren't attempting to prove a Fourteenth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.634" offset="8863866">They didn't have to prove a Fourteenth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.055" offset="8873583">No one was asking the court to rewrite this type of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.710" offset="8888107">They already had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.288" offset="8890511">The only issue there raised by the Board... In fact, I think Mr. Oade kind of mentions it here himself... is the question between tenured teachers and non-tentured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.410" offset="8926978">Now, that was resolved in the state court under Michigan state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.159" offset="8937949">The following year all the minority teachers, in fact, had tenure and the Board didn't take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.469" offset="8959160">Even though that litigation was pending, the labor agreement, collectively bargained, was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.200" offset="8982148">So, I think that is, with all due respect, a red herring on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.573" offset="9007644">It seems to me that the Board, having been told by this Court... I am not saying that you told Jackson specifically... but it seems to me the clear word that was sort of getting out, particularly after Brown Two and Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.553" offset="9063546">I don't mean to be paraphrasing perhaps what was going on here, but it seems that the Court had perhaps had it with some of the cases that kept coming up here with the same issues being raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.531" offset="9123418">We certainly felt that you would have to look where do you have your students placed, what kind of faculty do you have, and if you are going to integrate, this just wasn't one issue you would look at, you would look at where the students are, where the faculty is, and I certainly find it... And, one of the things we should have done, and, indeed, look at is as long as we were doing all of these things under our Fourteenth Amendment duties, should we not, after all, this being an educational institution, understand what it might do for us educationally and culturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.049" offset="9253508">And, I think the decision--</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.095" offset="9257688">Once you had, as an example, the stipulated to NAACP complaint in 1969, I think everybody got looking at this and said, gee, you know, this is not only the right thing to do, but it is the right thing to do educationally, let's have a culturally, ethnically diverse faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.823" offset="9320591">No one seems to quarrel with the competency of the Board to do that and no one seems to have suggested that there is anything the matter with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.148" offset="9353923">So, I guess the main fault we seem to have here is that because we don't have a really good record is because we voluntarily integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.583" offset="9379627">Now, had we been like Dayton or like Columbus or Detroit and refused to integrated, did not obey this Court's order until somebody sued us and made us do it, we would have the record you would want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.654" offset="9435947">But, Jackson voluntarily integrated and, therefore, it doesn't have the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.434" offset="9451098">So, we are sort of in a Catch-22 situation on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.949" offset="9461129">We either seemed to do what this Court wanted us to do and integrate and evaluate all those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.103" offset="9485684">You know, this wasn't some hasty decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.820" offset="9492581">It was done over a four-year period and it wasn't just the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.273" offset="9506373">It was the Jackson Board, it was a blue-ribbon committee, it was an ad hoc committee of faculty and administrators, it was the Minority Affairs Office, you had had the NAACP's complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.595" offset="9567709">It seems to me that in four years one could make this sort of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.907" offset="9580979">Now, I agree with Mr. Oade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.470" offset="9587249">It is not a hiring case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.046" offset="9593518">Article VII are goals, simple goals of what they thought would be nice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.121" offset="9613789">It is Article XII that tells you how you layoff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.556" offset="10103533">You know, before 1954 there was not one minority teacher in the Jackson public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.226" offset="10122236">Two hundred and fifty teachers were hired during the 50's.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.755" offset="10148359">Now, during that period... let's take 1953 and 1954... you had 9,966 students, 355 teachers, and one of them was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.455" offset="10191095">In 1961, you had 12,611 students, 515 teachers, and ten of them were minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.358" offset="10222755">Now, by 1971, and this is stipulated to in the record, they went on an intensive recruitment program to bring teachers in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.837" offset="10264656">Now, in 1972, okay, you actually had the integration plan which now went to busing and went to the allocation of the faculty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.503" offset="10947288">And, these teachers... Let me tell you this and I think it has been highly responsible... because they have subordinated seniority, not only...

            <text syncTime="2716.761" offset="11008414">It is subordinated to protect programs, it is subordinated to take care of such things as elementary art, music, and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.146" offset="11073929">No one would say that because these teachers who bargained to subordinate seniority for the good of the program or for the good of the kids' education, that some how there was a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.985" offset="11117293">But, for heaven's sake, in this case to have diverse faculty, we also mentioned the nasty word "race".</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.874" offset="11136832">So, if one of them happens to be laid off for that reason, now we are here constitutionally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.912" offset="11996992">--That is true, but all I am saying is when you are looking at the total layoffs, Justice White, you are looking at all of these other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.362" offset="12018726">Now, quite frankly you have got to recognize this, if some of these other problems, for instance, protection of some of these other programs, hadn't been what they were, that teacher might have been laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.405" offset="12058955">So, to suggest very honestly that the only reason was that, I think, is inappropriate and inappropriate in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.386" offset="12086853">Now, you know, there isn't anything in Article XII at all that indicates there is any tie between Article XII and the minority student population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.398" offset="12134919">Article VII, as I have said, is a goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.351" offset="12142755">And, when Moses came down with the Ten Commandments, they were commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.287" offset="12154458">This is a goal and it doesn't have anything to do with Article XII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.645" offset="12167938">Sure, it is a hiring position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.770" offset="12176401">We have a non-discrimination clause in that labor agreement also and this is what we would like to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.454" offset="12199180">You know, we are never probably going to get it because of what the goal is because of the decline in teachers, but when go to the layoff clause, all it does it protect against elimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.653" offset="12239931">It limits not numerically but by a percentage against this minimal number with less seniority from being eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.727" offset="12280264">It doesn't say anything in there that you can't lay them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.132" offset="12293848">White teachers and minority teachers are both laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.911" offset="12312969">They are not immunitized by this by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.269" offset="12330419">So, I think the attempt to take Article VII and say, well, this is going to be here forever for this reason would not be a proper interpretation respectfully of that labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.247" offset="12386321">Now, let me suggest that no bad faith from anyone against either the union or the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.600" offset="12455702">I think the Court is well aware of that as has been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.629" offset="12471794">This is a question of diversity for the benefit of the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.285" offset="12486422">So, as we are looking at it from, an educational standpoint, and I suggest there is no compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.185" offset="12526024">To end a discriminatory system does not seem to be in keeping with what this Court had been saying in the 70's and certainly up to the time when Jackson was first integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.555" offset="12591539">You know, this is not a situation... These parties were reviewing this on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.225" offset="12614213">It has a definite life span as does anything else in a labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.425" offset="12631036">To suggest sort of in a whisper that somehow there is something wrong with the process... and I am not saying the Court ought to yield to constitutional questions to a labor agreement necessarily... but I would rather expect that we know it is part of integration, we know it is part of that plan, and you know why you have done it; that rather than a whisper that perhaps there is some impropriety in that process, there would be some real allegations and some real proof and the Petitioners never put in anything in this case, including the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.131" offset="12757887">In the sad history of really what occurred after Brown Two, Jackson, I think recognizing the time to come, elected to obey this Court's decisions and the law by voluntarily integrating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.376" offset="12814834">In doing so it didn't wait to be sued, only obey the law when it knew it had to obey it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.669" offset="12847957">Now, the language under attack here certainly arises, as we have already discussed perhaps longer than we should have, from a compelling governmental interest and one which we say certainly is educationally sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.727" offset="12892261">Now, I think this Court has indicated that school boards have a specialized ability to perhaps deal with these educational issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.084" offset="12917652">We furnish students with an ethnically diverse faculty so they can learn to live in a pluralistic society and that certainly is one of the goals and it is certainly still true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.267" offset="12950357">Now, through education the time is going to come when society will be able to be truly colorblind and judge people as I think this Court would want it to without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.030" offset="12997482">This is not, however, we would suggest to move back 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.652" offset="13015977">It is the time to move forward where these issues that you have here aren't going to be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.650" offset="13035934">Certainly the best place for this matter to be dealt with are in your educational halls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.617" offset="13051817">How are you going to deal with that if we aren't going to have this type of diverse ethnic faculty to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.818" offset="13080551">And, is the Board going to be second guessed in its good faith effort when it was supposed to be looking at whether or not it should integrate, when it did so over a four-year period, and it attempted to address the problem through the layoff clause not unilaterally, but with its teachers through the adversary process of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.043" offset="13165502">This is really a situation that is a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.418" offset="13182951">This wasn't a court ordered integration case and it certainly wasn't court-imposed language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.727" offset="13204267">These parties not only agreed to it in 1972, but these competent teachers, all of whom are well degreed, have felt it a good idea to continue this right through to the present date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.846" offset="13260692">They are aware of this case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.096" offset="13269678">Now, it is necessary to say you ought to yield to them, but I would certainly suggest in a constitutional review of the issue that there are some pretty strong process considerations that these people, indeed, have not been abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.059" offset="13325580">You have a good faith effort of competent parties, designed to protect the gains made, not to harm these Petitioners or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.134" offset="13361838">We would suggest on that basis that the language of Article XII found so offensive by the Petitioners should not be found offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.097" offset="13405724">As you know, this case at bar here was presented on stipulated facts, stipulated to the district court, no factual question was ever raised before the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.343" offset="13442713">We believe the governmental interest is compelling, so is the educational interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.746" offset="13472284">We would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.745" offset="13488271">Thank you.</text>
