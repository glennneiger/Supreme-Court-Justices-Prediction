            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143789">We will hear arguments first this morning in Thomas against the Superintendent of the Ohio Reformatory for Women.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley</label>
            <text syncTime="14.970" offset="203662">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if it please the Court, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, it is an honor to appear before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="238248">I understand from the clerk that this is the 50th anniversary of the very first argument in this building, so I am doubly honored that I am appearing before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.922" offset="271476">I would first express what I would consider my mea culpa.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.016" offset="291851">I wish that I had filed objections in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.738" offset="306689">It would have prevented having to come up to the Supreme Court for the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.331" offset="325079">It would have prevented a lot of time from having to be expended on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.025" offset="343887">However, I didn't, and I think that given the case law involved in this Court and the circuits that it wasn't necessary, and I would like to proceed with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.172" offset="388400">A little history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.261" offset="396759">My client was charged with murder in Cuyahoga County in Cleveland, where she was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.276" offset="420791">On appeal, Judge Krensler, who is now a Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland, held that from the current psychological and sociological research has emerged a profile of a battered woman as one who displays unique behavioral patterns and psychological characteristics as well as differences in reaction and perception, all of which are not within the knowledge of the average juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.521" offset="513787">He concluded that without expert testimony on the battered woman syndrome, a jury would be unable to have a sufficient comprehension of the defendant's state of mind at the time of the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.559" offset="561957">The Ohio Supreme Court granted review of the case and reversed the reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.053" offset="583900">I then went to the Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.294" offset="596961">It was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that the petition for habeas corpus be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.299" offset="620889">The District Court Judge had a de novo determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.413" offset="637399">Notwithstanding the failure to file objections, the Sixth Circuit, implementing what is now known as the Walters policy, held that by failing to object to the magistrate's report, one waives the right to appeal to the circuit from the District Court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.454" offset="713572">I then petitioned for cert and this Court granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.606" offset="726111">There are basically four points I would like to make on argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.888" offset="739276">The first and most important one is the interplay between the magistrate's act and Article 3 of the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.953" offset="771564">When our forefathers were setting up the new government after the Revolutionary War, they were very wary of putting all the governmental power, basically the legislative, executive, and judiciary, into the same hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.652" offset="830391">Accordingly, they felt that it was necessary that there be an independent judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.526" offset="845856">They wrote Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.697" offset="854529">Article 3 basically says that there shall be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.801" offset="882950">It also said that those courts were to be staffed by judges who have life tenure and a set salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.817" offset="910953">I must admit that Article 3 at first blush seems a relatively simple statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.800" offset="938956">It spawned a great deal of litigation in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.853" offset="951182">I do not pretend to understand Article 3 and the litigation it has spawned, particularly in such cases as Northern Pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.647" offset="978349">However, with regard to the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, this Court has quite clearly stated what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.164" offset="1012413">Now, the Magistrates Act was provided in Congress in 1976 and subsequently amended basically to set up a series of inferior judicial officers, inferior, that is, to the District Courts, to help the District Courts with the overwhelming case law that they were being presented with.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.665" offset="1090362">Basically, they may consider nondispositive pretrial matters, conduct evidentiary hearings of dispositive motions, habeas corpus, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.131" offset="1128292">In the section that we are dealing with here, that is, 28 USC 636(b)(1)(B), they can conduct hearings on a habeas corpus and then provide the judge with proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition by the Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.153" offset="1196315">Parties may file objections, and the Judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.067" offset="1224005">However, the last sentence, I think, is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.138" offset="1232259">The Court may accept, reject, or modify the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.542" offset="1249918">This Court in several cases has considered the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, most often through the pen of Chief Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.600" offset="1302163">The basic cases are the United States versus Raddatz and Mathews versus Weber.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.344" offset="1321076">This Court quite clearly has said the Magistrates Act is constitutional because the ultimate decisionmaking rests with the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.720" offset="1366633">Those cases basically came up with three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.893" offset="1375306">One, in going over the legislative history of the Magistrates Act, this Court has said Congress was sensitive to the Article 3 considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.320" offset="1416997">They were sensitive to not putting in a magistrate Article 3 duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.503" offset="1437791">Hence this Court stressed and Congress stressed that the ultimate adjudicatory determination was reserved to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.969" offset="1471645">The second point this Court has made in Raddatz and Mathews is, the Court says that the ultimate authority and responsibility to make an informed formal determination must remain with the Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.006" offset="1523786">Three, the Court stressed the magistrate's role is one of helping the Court to narrow the dispute, focusing on the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.512" offset="1557745">However, it again stressed the Court alone remains the ultimate decisionmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.097" offset="1580106">In sum, this Court said in Raddatz and Weber, the delegation of the magistrate to hear issues does not violate Article 3 so long as the ultimate decision is made by the District Court.</text>
