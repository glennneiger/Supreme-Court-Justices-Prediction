            <text syncTime="10.091" offset="174779">Mr. Burnham, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="79.702" stopTime="196.249">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="453244">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to reserve five minutes of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.512" offset="488457">This case is actually comprised of two Section 1983 class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.603" offset="516774">The claims in the cases are essentially that the defendant state official violated the plaintiff's statutory rights under Title 4(d) of the Social Security Act, thereby depriving them of AFDC benefits to which they were entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.299" offset="579573">The two cases factually parallel each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.298" offset="595559">However, I will indicated briefly what those were.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.264" offset="611442">The cases were filed in 1980 and 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.982" offset="622309">The first case, denominated Michigan Welfare Rights Organization versus Dempsey originally, is the child care expense case, in which Michigan in concluding an AFDC budget refused to allow a deduction for the expenses of child care which were necessary to be paid for the recipient to go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.896" offset="706005">This, petitioners believe, violated clear pre-October, 1981, federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.705" offset="733173">This court has decided a case on that very issue, Shea versus Vialpando.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.687" offset="749159">The Department of Health and Human Services, which is charged with administration of the Act, wrote Michigan several letters telling them essentially that, and they nonetheless did not change the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.059" offset="786671">However, in October, 1981, federal law changed, and federal law continued the requirement that there be deductions allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.837" offset="825750">However, Michigan changed its regulation to comply with the new federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.991" offset="846335">The reason for that presumably was because the new federal law imposed a limitation of $160 a month, and Michigan believed, I suppose, that it could live with that, and therefore changed its policy to comply with the new federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.406" offset="904013">The other case, Benas versus Dempsey--</text>

            <text syncTime="208.854" offset="969842">Consequently, what remains is our request for summary judgment as to the defendant's compliance with federal law before October of 1981, and the issue, but relief may be granted based upon that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.145" offset="1050926">All we are seeking is a declaratory judgment or some other substantive federal question determination, and an injunctive order requiring the defendant to send notice relief as was done in the case of Quern versus Jordan, which this Court decided in 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.619" offset="1132846">First of all, the Sixth Circuit found that it was not moot, and we believe that that analysis is in fact correct, although they decided against us on the Eleventh Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.163" offset="1163044">In order to be moot, of course, under Garrity, there must be a lack of any cognizable legal interest, and the issues are no longer live.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.176" offset="1203063">Under this circumstances, the issues are clearly live.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.554" offset="1304627">To state it more specifically, we believe that the interest is in being given the opportunity to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.286" offset="1343497">In other words, class members may decide that they do not want to pursue that remedy, or they may decide that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.315" offset="1367635">If they do pursue that remedy, they may not be able to actually get an award of retroactive benefits because of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.840" offset="1409744">For instance, an award of costs, the outstanding issue of costs won't keep a case from being moot.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="325.791" offset="1437538">It strikes me that this is really awfully far down the line so far as any live controversy about federal issues is concerned.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="333.398" stopTime="396.106">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="333.398" offset="1467945">Well, petitioners would respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.881" offset="1481946">This case is in no different position than the case of Quern versus Jordan was in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.284" offset="1503576">In Quern versus Jordan, the issue involved was a question of whether or not notice really could be ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.782" offset="1529489">And in this case, the entire program to which the relief could have related had been abolished for over a year by the time the District Court considered notice of relief and had been abolished for approximately four years by the time that this Court approved the notice of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.666" offset="1593019">However, in the case, and I think it is an indication of how that case was still alive, in that case this Court affirmed an en banc Seventh Circuit decision saying that notice really should be ordered, and after notice of relief was ordered, in fact, the class members, some of them, filed for administrative bearings, and then after they had exhausted their administrative remedies, went to the Illinois Court of Claims, and in fact were able to get an award of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.703" offset="1697195">Now, that award of benefits, of course, was under state law as a result of actions taken by the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.106" offset="1718825">There were no damage claims in Quern?</text>

            <text syncTime="398.683" offset="1729169">There were no... well, Quern was Edelman versus Jordan revisited.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.807" offset="1745574">Consequently there was originally a request for equitable restitution, in other words, a direct award that the state pay those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.726" offset="1773264">This Court in Edelman versus Jordan, of course, held that that violated the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.209" offset="1791236">On remand to the District Court in Quern, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that no such order, of course, direct order to pay benefits would be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.939" offset="1838152">However, limited injunctive relief requiring that a notice be provided of the availability of state administrative remedies could in fact be ordered, and that was the context in which it arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.902" offset="1882038">In other words, this case is just like Quern in the sense that there is no current live claim for an injunction against future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.946" offset="1914221">However, there are live claims for past violations and for notice relief to allow the claims the opportunity to seek redress for those past violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.930" offset="2222152">Under Michigan law, administrative hearings are available in the circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.051" offset="2422564">It is our view that that phrase simply refers to the way that the word "ancillary" is used in Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.482" offset="2492363">And the court was in essence saying the notice approved by the District Court was not ancillary, but the notice of proof by the Court of Appeals was ancillary.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.681" offset="2521097">Well, if in fact the Sixth Circuit's reading of ancillary is correct, that would make no sense, because those notices, the only difference in the notices was the form of the notice, and the fact that it could be ordered was the same in both situations, both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.236" offset="2595390">Consequently, taking that data, it is quite clear that it could not have referred to ancillary power to enter that kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.436" offset="2624124">It could only refer to the usual meaning of ancillary, which is that the effect of that relief was ancillary to a proper substantive federal question determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.224" offset="6563285">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.896" offset="6566002">Under the circumstances of this case, plaintiffs believe that the District Court, that the Sixth Circuit decision is completely contrary to the rule of Ex Parte Young and the rule of Edelman versus Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.389" offset="6639981">Ex Parte Young in essence held that a suit against a state officer is in fact not a suit against a state, but Ford Motor Company and Edelman, of course, make it clear that it in fact monetary relief is sought, then that pierces the fiction of Ex Parte Young, and it again may become a suit against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.006" offset="6718453">Under the circumstances here, the Court in Quern has quite clearly held that notice relief, this kind of relief, is not a money judgment, and consequently the Ford Motor Company exception does not apply to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.392" offset="6771951">Consequently, it should be treated no differently than any other kind of injunctive relief, and after all, it is an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.171" offset="6799119">It is an order to the state that they in fact provide certain kinds of notices to the plaintiff class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.606" offset="6828794">And under the circumstances, it should not be deemed to violate the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.697" offset="6849169">Indeed, the Ex Parte Young Court mentions the situation of habeas corpus relief, which is a situation where obviously there is a determination that in the past the state officials violated the federal rights of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.582" offset="6908728">However, the Court indicated that that was not a violation of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.017" offset="6926492">That is a clear indication to petitioners that Ex Parte Young was not as narrow as the Sixth Circuit would say it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.671" offset="6957107">In other words, it did not just provide for prospective injunction against ongoing violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.950" offset="6978214">In fact, it contemplated explicitly a determination of past misconduct, and of course that in modern Eleventh Amendment parlance, the habeas corpus writ would not violate the Eleventh Amendment simply because there was no impact on the state treasury in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.723" offset="7045297">That is like the expunction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.661" offset="7053029">That is like the public employee record expunction situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.971" offset="7074240">It is non-monetary relief, albeit based upon a past determination of misconduct, and that is permitted by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.202" offset="7107155">The final point I would like to mention is that the reading of the Sixth Circuit in this case of Ex Parte Young gives the state a virtually limitless power to control the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.069" offset="7178626">There was a great deal of delay in these cases, and of course the federal court dockets are very crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.286" offset="7203494">The state can quite easily have an incentive to look to delay because they can simply avoid any determination of past misconduct by at the eleventh hour complying with future... with ongoing federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.093" offset="7262740">If they do that, then they wipe out any past claim for the back benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.090" offset="7282802">That sort of control over the court's jurisdiction quite clearly should not be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.463" offset="7304222">The facts of this case, in fact the stepparent violation that we believe is... the state is engaged in right now, quite clearly the state could render that issue quite moot by saying, okay, we know the stakes are high in this case because an order could be ancillary to that ongoing injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.689" offset="7389173">Consequently, we will decide that we will comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.798" offset="7405577">That would then divest the District Court of jurisdiction, and under the ancillary theory of Quern there would be no basis for ordering a notice relief remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.090" offset="7438805">That sort of power should not be allowed, and it doesn't make any sense, simply because the issue of future violations and the issue of past violations are two rather distinct things.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="1849.455" offset="7532219">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Court of Appeals decision in this case that is on review was compelled by law principles that were previously established by decisions of this Court, and the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment requires adherence to those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.465" offset="7608288">In this case, the petitioners could have availed themselves of a state forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.962" offset="7630230">Instead, they chose the federal forum to deal with two cases in which the judicial power was constitutionally limited, and now are strenuously attempting to override that limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.566" offset="7676624">They contend that they are not after money relief by way of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.923" offset="7694074">A declaratory ruling of past actions coupled with a notice as an invitation to class members to seek state administrative relief as to those past actions as requested here, I suggest, is designed to obtain retroactive payment of an accrued monetary liability through the force of a federal judicial power in contravention of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.946" offset="7794175">And it certainly becomes quite evident that that would be the case when you consider the nature of a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.600" offset="7820820">A declaratory judgment under the Act is a final judgment, and it adjudicates the rights of the parties involved, and it is an actual case in controversy, and it would cover a period here when the respondent was not under a final court imposed obligation to comport her conduct with different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.307" offset="7923638">Now, this becomes quite evident when you consider the ancillary notices that were considered in Quern and in Edelman and in Trainor v. Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.163" offset="7963030">The first notice was rejected by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.536" offset="7980585">After rejecting the first notice, they approved a notice that merely advised the class that the court described as one that simply informed the class that the federal suit is at an and and the federal court can provide no further relief, and if they may wish to pursue state administrative remedies, they may do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.947" offset="8078178">But this kind of notice, the Court said, didn't impose any retroactive liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.462" offset="8092284">It was in no way handicapped by a federal court determination of state liability, and in that case, in the case, in the Quern case, there was an adjudication by the court of misconduct, and there was a prospective compliance order entered in that court, and we don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.780" offset="8181519">The Court, however, found the first notice offered in Quern to be infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.309" offset="8203670">It expressed a finding of past liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.777" offset="8213493">That notice stated, you are denied public assistance to which you were entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.182" offset="8231151">Respondent submits that if the Court were to allow that kind of notice that was found acceptable by the Court in Quern to be coupled, predicated on a declaratory judgment of past actions as requested by petitioners, the Quern notice would be changed in its import because it would become indistinguishable from a substantive federal question determination by a federal court of past action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.202" offset="8335223">It would import the same degree of finality that the first notice that was proposed in Quern that was found to be, that was found by the Court to be infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.760" offset="8381408">It would permit, as the Court said in Colbeth, to do indirectly what is prohibited to be done directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.476" offset="8416307">Insofar as Ex Parte Young is concerned, Ex Parte Young was cast by the Court as an exception, as a necessary exception to vindicate federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.159" offset="8466985">And the relief in that case was a prospective compliance order against a state official to comport, to have that official comport his conduct with the constitution and not enforce a statute that was held to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.012" offset="8530410">At no time has Ex Parte Young or the subsequent cases applied by this Court dealing with the exception encompassed declaratory judgments of past actions in the notice relief requested here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.718" offset="10509238">I think that that is the way you have to read the Quern notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.496" offset="10528359">The Quern notice, I think, probably would have to be the past violation, but nevertheless insofar as we... as the courts have gone today, it has to be based upon a prospective compliance order and not a judgment as to past action, because an injunction, a determination by injunctive order doesn't adjudicate the actions that have taken place heretofore as a declaratory judgment to past actions would necessarily do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.844" offset="10645806">At any rate, as I say, I wish to make it clear that the respondent does not seek any decision here that would permit the avoidance of the state's responsibility with respect to the state's federal aided programs, public welfare programs, because they do have the administrative procedures in place or mandated by Congress, and also there is available the judicial forum in the state and they could... that could review any decisions made at the administrative level, and they could take judicial action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.014" offset="10830439">But, Mr. Caruso, it is true that your position is that whatever federal question of law has to be decided ought to be decided by the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.214" offset="10851233">Not every federal question of law, but in this situation, the type of relief that they are seeking here should be decided in state court because the type of relief that is available to them because of the Eleventh Amendment immunity is only a prospective injunction, and a prospective injunction is not available here simply because there is no violation of federal law, and there has never been a determination made by a federal court that there was at any time a violation of federal law.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="2718.449" offset="11008177">I would like to just briefly respond to something that Mr. Caruso said about the availability of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.742" offset="11029388">In fact, as indicated in our reply brief in the stepparent case, for those persons who asked for hearings, they were denied hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.146" offset="11058959">They were told that because it was an automatic change in grants and so on, they could not get an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.080" offset="11082678">Now, later they changed that policy when they found that that was also a violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.533" offset="11100546">However, at the time that the suit was filed, it was quite clear that the plaintiffs were unable to get any relief by way of the state administrative tribunal, which is, of course, one of the reasons why they filed in federal court.</text>
