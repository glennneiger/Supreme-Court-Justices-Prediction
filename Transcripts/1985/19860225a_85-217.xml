            <text syncTime="26.281" offset="236751">In this case the ILA attempted to organize a group of ship superintendents, and the union is alleged to have told the men it could get them their jobs back if they were fired for union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="294116">The first issue to consider is whether the defense of federal preemption is waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.481" offset="329538">In the Garmon case, this Court said that when an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the Act, the states are deprived of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.371" offset="381051">Since the defense of federal preemption deprives the Court, the State Court of subject matter jurisdiction, the defense should be nonwaivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.560" offset="417832">Among the factors that the Court noted in Garmon in reaching this conclusion is that the LMRA is not merely a matter of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.385" offset="469136">Congress created a tribunal, the National Labor Relations Board, with specially designed procedures, and the Court recognized that a variety of local procedures and attitudes could lead to inconsistent adjudications just as easily as inconsistent rules of substantive law.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.157" offset="696192">The question then would be a matter of full faith and credit, and I believe full faith and credit does not preclude inquiry into jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.974" offset="811445">Because in Garmon I believe that this Court held that Congress deprived the states of subject matter jurisdiction to rule on this type of a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.685" offset="874347">Congress took the subject matter jurisdiction away, and therefore the states have no--</text>

            <text syncTime="232.047" offset="1059817">Well, I think that's the only jurisdiction that the Court could have been talking about because the Court was very concerned with a variety of local procedures being applied by the states and a variety of attitudes being possessed by the states on labor controversies, and I think the only way that Congress could ensure that these types of issues were submitted to the Board and that the conduct that Congress intended to be protected under Section 7 would be protected would be if state courts did not have the jurisdiction to reach the merits of this type of controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.090" offset="1515915">I mean, if they had thought of the defense, I don't think they would have risked waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.874" offset="1531066">It would have been very simple for the trial court to raise federal preemption on its own, sua sponte, because the allegations of the complaint show that the alleged misrepresentation arose from organizational activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.548" offset="1669724">Well, under the Alabama rules of civil procedure, the court is to raise subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.236" offset="1704519">It's the same as the federal rules as far as that's concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.438" offset="1717371">Well, yes, but presumably, you know, you have your typical generalist trial court judge has to be familiar with a number of different areas of law, to expect him to raise it when a party in whose interest it is to raise it doesn't know enough to raise it would be a rather strange rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.298" offset="1784767">But I think this Court said in Lockridge that the Court designed the arguably protected standard so state trial courts could very easily police themselves in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.009" offset="1855611">They don't have to be right because if they make the wrong decision, the issue will go to the state appeals court or ultimately this Court on appeal, but they can satisfy any interest in efficiency, in integrity and in finality of the trial court proceeding by raising the issue sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.156" offset="1936173">Indeed, in this particular case I don't believe there was any waste of trial time at all because the Alabama Supreme Court indicates in its opinion that even if they didn't think the defense was waivable, they don't think federal preemption applies on the merits, and it's clear from that that even if the defense had been raised say, on a motion to dismiss, and the trial court had granted a motion to dismiss, the Alabama Supreme Court would have sent the case back for trial because they said in their footnote they didn't think it was preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.922" offset="2131255">In other words, some of the cases we say there is actual... it's actually prohibited or actually protected, and others arguably prohibited and arguably protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.506" offset="3669658">No, the parties did not proceed to the point of collective bargaining although the superintendents signed authorization cards; the union never got to the point of sitting down with the employer, perhaps once the coercive discharges of Davis and Trione took place, the organizational drive really fell apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.103" offset="3755967">I believe that in this case the state interest in applying its law is exceedingly weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.292" offset="3792747">The superintendents, after all, made a Section 7 decision that they would affiliate with the union and authorize the union to engage in collective bargaining for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.599" offset="3845933">Obviously the State of Alabama has no interest in regulating this Section 7 decision that the superintendents made.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.574" offset="3885848">The state also has a very little interest here in protecting the employment relationship of these people that were fired for union activities because the Alabama state law is that it is a hiring at will, and the employer could fire them for really any reason whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.869" offset="3959095">The statement that was allegedly made by the union that the superintendents could get their job back embodies with it an opinion that the men are being told that they are employees rather than supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.080" offset="4031925">Based on the federal policy of free debate that this Court recognized in the Linn and Austin cases, I believe these type of opinion statements should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.440" offset="4089394">Further, Section 8(c) of the act which, although by its terms it applies to written communications, I think goes on to say that views, arguments or opinions are not evidence of an unfair labor practice and therefore should be arguably protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.152" offset="4164209">In this case, as I have said, the plaintiff did not seek his remedy before the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.276" offset="4204646">Instead, he filed a state misrepresentation action in which an essential element of the cause of action was the falsity of the representation on the part of the ILA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.084" offset="4255951">The jury had to find that Davis was in fact a supervisor to conclude that the representation that the ILA made was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.206" offset="4296388">Now, this issue, whether or not the man was a supervisor, has been entrusted to the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.760" offset="4318645">Davis could have filed an unfair labor practice charge under Section 8(a)(1) or 8(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.449" offset="4353335">If he was an employee, the discharge by the employer was coercive or discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.369" offset="4381025">Now, as a result, what is implicated here is the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.225" offset="4412476">If this is a Section 7 case, we claim arguable protection; however, we also implicate the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB, the jurisdiction of the board to rule on this employee-supervisor question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.152" offset="4472140">Since Davis could have invoked board jurisdiction, the Sears case is distinguishable because Sears turned on the inability of the aggrieved party to seek board jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.163" offset="7864192">I was going to point out to this Court that the Alabama Supreme Court decision was based solely on Alabama procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.221" offset="7904421">This is not Michigan v. Long where the state court decision was based upon two grounds and the Court went ahead, the Supreme Court of the state went ahead and stated that it was ruling the way it did because of the way it interpreted Terry v. Ohio, which of course was the United States Supreme Court case dealing with the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.836" offset="7998880">In this case, preemption under Alabama procedure was determined by the Alabama Supreme Court to be an affirmative defense which, if not pleaded, is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.192" offset="8040362">This, I think, is supported by the decisions in this Court, the Lockridge decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.648" offset="8078187">In the Lockridge decision, this Court stated that when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, it didn't tell us to what extent it ousted state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.455" offset="8125417">Therefore, we, the Supreme Court of the United States, are not going to hold that the National Labor Relations Act preempted local regulation which in every and any way touches upon the complex relationships between unions, employees and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.054" offset="8211830">The Court went on to state, obviously much of this is left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.523" offset="8229698">Certainly when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, it never expressed an intention to preempt state procedural... state procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.682" offset="8286331">Absent a clear intent to preempt state procedure, federal law takes state courts where it finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.788" offset="8326769">This Court stated that in Brown v. Gerdes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.490" offset="8337531">As a matter of fact, the first judiciary act, and from the very beginning, we have envisioned that state courts would adjudicate state claims and federal claims without the imposition of a federal procedural code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.653" offset="8418197">The ILA argues that preemption goes to subject matter jurisdiction and that it cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.025" offset="8455709">Of course, I have already pointed out what this Court stated in Lockridge, that obviously much is left to the states in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.531" offset="8485698">In the Garmon case, the Farmer case, the Sears case, the Linn case, this Court applied a weighing test to determine whether or not the states, the interest that the state was attempting to protect outweighed the conflict with the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.461" offset="8573469">That necessarily implies that state courts in the first instance in these situations have the right to hear evidence, take testimony, and decide and decipher preemption from non-preemption issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.090" offset="8643895">Furthermore, we feel that subject matter jurisdiction and how a state court applies and recognizes subject matter jurisdiction is a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.250" offset="8696558">The Alabama courts, as I have already stated, consider nonwaivable only the narrow class of true jurisdictional objections such as bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.323" offset="8748907">It's truly amazing how the ILA tried this case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.660" offset="8778269">They came into the Circuit Court of Mobile County, agreed to play ball by the rules in the Circuit Court of Mobile County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.051" offset="8827797">They didn't object to those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.419" offset="8841276">They didn't object to the procedural rules in the state of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.390" offset="8857159">And now they stand before the highest court in the land and ask you to give them another shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.829" offset="8894880">They never raised the preemption until after the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.983" offset="8915464">They raised it then in a motion for j.n.o.v. as ground number 15 of 16 grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.689" offset="8958305">They waited approximately two years after the beginning of this lawsuit before they raised it, and they had plenty of opportunity under Alabama procedure to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.913" offset="9007206">They could have raised it on their motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.765" offset="9014625">They could have raised it in their answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.467" offset="9025492">They could have amended their answer at any time even before the jury Goes out in Alabama you can amend your answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.971" offset="9051510">They could have raised it on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.006" offset="9063631">They could have raised it on directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.910" offset="9083170">They filed a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.345" offset="9092992">They filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.862" offset="9099053">They filed a motion for directed verdict at the end of my case, my client's case, and also at the end of all the evidence, never mentioned it, never said one word about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.003" offset="9147641">There's no record on preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.021" offset="9159657">This case wasn't tried with preemption in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.675" offset="9174285">In the Herndon v. Georgia case, this Court recognized that a federal constitutional right can be waived if it's not timely raised under state procedure, and if it's not timely raised under state procedure and it is therefore not passed on below, this Court held in Herndon v. Georgia that it wouldn't reach the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.058" offset="9279820">The issue was not passed upon below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.360" offset="9289015">The ILA concedes, as well they conceded in their brief, they conceded to you here today, that if Mr. Davis were a supervisor, there would be no preemption and no question about preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.906" offset="9363203">Again, it is totally amazing how they tried this case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.393" offset="9389116">Their tune has completely changed since they tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.047" offset="9411791">They never challenged Davis' supervisory status below in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.385" offset="9445123">They never... they are the ones who introduced the regional director's ruling with respect to Mr. Trione, Mr. Trione being a fellow ship superintendent at Ryan-Walsh like Davis was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.060" offset="9499771">Mr. Trione was provided an attorney by the ILA when he was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.448" offset="9521401">He wasn't able to bring his lawsuit because he had to go bankrupt before he got to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.535" offset="9545747">But they hired him an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.422" offset="9565286">The attorney filed a complaint just like they were talking about to seek to make Ryan-Walsh reinstate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.660" offset="9598201">The regional director ruled that he was a supervisor, had no protection under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.849" offset="9622965">He was represented at that time by an ILA attorney, no appeal taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.134" offset="9644072">They introduced the ruling of the regional director at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.906" offset="9671239">They introduced Trione, set up a picket at their urgence, a one-man picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.743" offset="9694540">Ryan-Walsh went down and filed a preliminary injunction against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.611" offset="9710005">The state... the circuit court in Mobile County ruled again, Mr. Trione, as a ship superintendent at Ryan-Walsh, you are a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.467" offset="9745427">They at the trial below asked the circuit judge to charge the jury that supervisors could join unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.874" offset="9799030">They didn't challenge Mr. Trione's definition or delineation of ship superintendent's duties that were set out at the trial of this case.</text>
