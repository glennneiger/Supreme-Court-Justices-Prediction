            <text syncTime="17.306" offset="212384">This morning the Court has before it a Religion Clause case involving a vocational rehabilitation program for the blind.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.631" offset="237671">It is important to note that it is a neutral program and that it is broadly available to all blind citizens of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.003" offset="263166">This is not an occasion where the State of Washington's legislature has attempted to subterfuge the decisions of this Court and go around and find a clever way to get state aid through religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.046" offset="315307">Nor is this case where it can be claimed that it is not really aid to individuals, but is a transparent fiction of aid to religious schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.274" offset="524286">No, Your Honor, he is washing dishes in a medical laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.930" offset="538915">It is our position in this case that there is no justification under the Establishment Clause to single out ministerial students for exclusion from participation in a broad government program.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.971" offset="591055">We would also argue that the Free Exercise Clause indeed forbids such exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.609" offset="609550">The guiding principle that this Court has used in its Religion Clause cases is the principle of religious neutrality and we think that the government does not have to discriminate against religious persons in order to prove how neutral it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.058" offset="659392">Ministerial students do not have to be quarantined from the access to public benefits nor to demonstrate that the church is committed to a course of religious... or the state is committed to a course of religious neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.413" offset="704845">On the first half of our argument, we will deal with the Establishment Clause and we must deal both with the position of the State Supreme Court and the State Department for the Blind, because the state... Department, although they support the result below, they have switched positions and now have abandoned the reasoning below and are making a new line of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.498" offset="785197">First, we will deal with the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.965" offset="795019">That Court held that flatly the government may never fund the training of ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.886" offset="818739">Now, the problem with this is, of course, that it endangers not only this federal program but the G.I. Bill, Social Security recipients who use their benefits to train for the ministry, and programs like the Federally Insured Student Loan Program.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.929" offset="998879">The position of the State Supreme Court, we contend, is not in accordance with this Court's rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.082" offset="1031480">This Court has never struck down a neutral program that is broadly available to all citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.408" offset="1048825">This Court has indeed said that such a program is not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.656" offset="1069828">The State Supreme Court held that the primary effect of the aid to Witters was to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.575" offset="1101488">Now, the error in this analysis is that they looked solely at Witters, rather than looking at the primary effect of the entire program.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.963" offset="1131059">It is our contention that the proper judge of the primary effect prong of the Court's tripartite test under Lemon versus Kurtzman... They should have looked at the entire program, not simply the aid of Witters.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.720" offset="2138027">It is our argument today that this case is constitutionally indistinguishable from such a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.406" offset="2156835">Now, the state, Department for the Blind's position, their new position that they have switched from, is based, first of all, on arguments that are outside the record and facts that are outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.995" offset="2211170">They, among other things, are attacking for the first time in this Court the constitutionality of the entire federal program, although that issue was never raised in any court below and neither was the fact to give some potential relevancy to this federal program introduced below and that is this is the federal program in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.974" offset="2279088">There is no factual proof of that and counsel for the Petitioner has no knowledge of whether that is true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.065" offset="2303434">In any event, these new arguments and these new facts are very easily answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.593" offset="2321511">The federal statutes and regulations in question require the state, according to their argument, to evaluate, to counsel, and to approve the program of the blind individual who comes into participation in the vocational rehabilitation scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.619" offset="2385668">This can be done, we would contend, objectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.837" offset="2394549">In fact, the statutes and the regulations in contest require objectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.287" offset="2420358">29 U.S.C. Section 722(b)(4) that is in the Appendix of the Respondent's brief, requires objective criteria in an evaluation procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.766" offset="2466229">And 34 Code of Federal Regulations, 361.33(b) lists those objective criteria such as educational achievement and work experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.138" offset="2503741">There is nothing in this record before this Court to give rise to any basis for speculating as to the way the actual program works under the federal guidelines; that there is some violation under the imprimatur test or the excessive entanglement test.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.007" offset="2563196">They simply would be speculation on the part of Respondent that would even get us into these questions and there is nothing in the record to support such speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.612" offset="2601648">As we have argued in our reply brief, we think the perfect analogy to this situation is a building inspector who is required to approve a church's building plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.749" offset="2646161">Now, that building inspector must evaluate the plans, sometimes must counsel the church's architect or church's builder or carpenters on the appropriateness of their plan, the placement of the pews, the placement of the baptistry, the location of the altar, perhaps for safety reasons, and they must ultimately approve those church building plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.414" offset="2716796">We contend that that is the same kind of situation that is at hand today.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.693" offset="2733932">Both situations are hands-on in the analogy or the criteria that is advanced by the state in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.690" offset="2761935">They have said hands-on funding of ministerial programs are unconstitutional, while hands-off programs like the G.I. Bill are appropriately constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.763" offset="2802164">These may provide neat labels but there is no constitutional justification for these labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.589" offset="2825465">Our position is that all citizens and all buildings must be treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.010" offset="2847199">Church buildings are treated just like any other assembly building.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.602" offset="2857543">Blind ministerial students must be treated equally just like all other blind students.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.397" offset="2876770">The Respondent, however, does not distance himself from the central fallacy of the State Supreme Court, although they try to basically repudiate that Court's decision; that is they still continue to focus on just ministerial students to make their analysis of the primary effect test and the excessive entanglement test.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.764" offset="2954196">This Court, in the case of Mueller and Widmar, held that provisions of benefits to a broad spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect and the state chooses to ignore the fact that this has been the case here; that there is a broad spectrum of groups of all blind students, of all careers, that are entitled to participate in a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.489" offset="3049073">We would suggest that there is no imprimatur of government approval for religious institutions in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.549" offset="3077390">Equal treatment has never been held by this Court to be an unconstitutional... to create an unconstitutional imprimatur under the terms of Widmar versus Vincent and a number of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.998" offset="3123156">There is no fatal symbolism in this case as would be suggested by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.292" offset="3140293">In fact, we would say the public would perceive this more as an anti-discrimination kind of law rather than an endorsement of religion kind of law that this Court has found to be fatally violating the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.944" offset="3194941">In the case of McDaniel versus Paty, this Court rejected an idea that is central to the state's position and that is that ministers as symbols of the church somehow justify disparate treatment of those ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.205" offset="3248022">Of course, we are dealing here with ministerial students rather than those who have accomplished their training and have reached their desired career objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.625" offset="3277697">There is no constitutional distinguishment between those two statuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.967" offset="3295042">Simply because Larry Witters wants to be a minister the state feels there is some symbolic violation of the First Amendment here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.425" offset="6388881">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.516" offset="6409256">I wish to address four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.530" offset="6421272">First, I wish to discuss why this particular vocational rehabilitation program is not like the G.I. Bill or, and this is saying the same thing, why it is not like the program involved in Mueller versus Allen and I wish to discuss why this difference is critical constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.723" offset="6518030">Second, I wish to touch on this question that has been referred to in counsel's argument as to the statutory source of the federal funding and supposed deficiencies of the record on this question, because that bears upon whether or not I should have been making my first point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.465" offset="6597024">Thirdly, I wish to examine how this question of our submission differs from that of the court below and what difference, if any, it makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.384" offset="6644672">And, fourthly, I wish to step back and ask what role does the Free Exercise Clause play in all of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.973" offset="6671003">I think by now it is apparent that it is important indeed and that the Petitioner is trying to use the Free Exercise Clause not only to invalidate the religion clauses of our state Constitution, but also to have the Free Exercise Clause swallow up a large part, I would suggest, of the Establishment Clause jurisprudence of this Court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.870" offset="6762641">Before turning to our first point though, I want to take up this question of state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.290" offset="6792316">We have two constitutional provisions that are relevant in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.220" offset="6852084">Article I, Section 11, says no public money shall be applied to any religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.108" offset="6879565">Article IX, Section 4, says all schools maintained or supported, wholly or in part by public funds, shall be ever free from sectarian control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.260" offset="6928152">In Weiss versus Bruno, a decision of our State Supreme Court, which was referred to in the decision below in this very case, the Court made it clear that it takes... under those religion clauses the funding restrictions for religious instruction for church-affiliated schools are even more strict than those established by this Court under the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.655" offset="7049779">Now, that is the source of the policy that we are talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.276" offset="7084260">Now, that policy in the state Constitution was embodied in a written policy statement applicable to this particular program which said we cannot fund ministerial students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.113" offset="7147581">But, Justice Rehnquist is absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.454" offset="7164926">That policy is embodied right in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.750" offset="7178196">Secondly, I would suggest that there is nothing in the state statutes involving this program which are contrary to that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.775" offset="7230232">The state statutes or the state statute which we used have... it was changed somewhat in 1983... said the Commission for the Blind may maintain or cause to be maintained a program of services to assist visually handicapped people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.535" offset="7297315">Under such program the Commission may provide for special education or training in professions, businesses, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.157" offset="7327826">The new statute for all practical purposes is quite similar in this respect, that it is discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.483" offset="7353112">I do not read in there a legislative determination that, boy, we want to fund ministerial training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.652" offset="7381743">So, again, we have the basic policy established in our Constitution which the Petitioner wishes to have invalidated and we do not have a clear legislative declaration that it wants to override that policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.707" offset="8049955">Now, what I might call the normal rule seems to be that in cases such as this one must separate out the secular from the sectarian and fund only the secular, not the sectarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.606" offset="8133547">However, there is apparently an exception, what you might call the delivery system, which embodies a hands-off, passive role on the part of the government, and if the program in terms of beneficiaries is sufficiently broad-based, apparently one does not need to make this separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.050" offset="8227379">I would suggest that is the rationale which was applied in Mueller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.705" offset="8245978">I would suggest that that is the rationale which would justify the application of the G.I. Bill to ministerial training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.810" offset="8278370">Now, there is, of course, in this case no effort whatsoever to make any such separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.262" offset="8296237">So, the effort must be to come within what we might call the Mueller G.I. Bill exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.431" offset="8320897">The Solicitor General and the Petitioner in his opening brief argued exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.944" offset="8346915">This program was just like the G.I. Bill and the Mueller rationale applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.693" offset="8365932">Now, we say that it is not like the G.I. Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.957" offset="8378993">The Mueller rationale does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.768" offset="8386203">Let me illustrate in terms of the G.I. Bill itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.455" offset="8396965">Under the G.I. Bill the government really just cares that the veteran is in an accredited school and that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.888" offset="8430716">The specific school that he goes to, as long as it is accredited... and by the way, the federal government doesn't even do the accreditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.699" offset="8457988">The specific school is of no concern to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.260" offset="8472198">What courses he takes are of no concern to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.900" offset="8486722">Whether the student has made any sort of career source is of no concern to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.224" offset="8512009">He could take Sanskrit and spend the rest of his time wandering around in India, say, and that is of no concern to the government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.097" offset="8543565">But, let's change things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.113" offset="8547640">Let's suppose that the government amended the G.I. Bill and said you have to make a career choice now and we have to approve that career choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.952" offset="8591003">In light of that career choice, we also have to approve the school and the courses you want to select to make sure that it all fits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.167" offset="8631859">Now, let's set aside for the moment the question of how the government goes about making those decisions, what criteria to use to approve or not approve those choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.695" offset="8673968">The mere fact of need for approval, it seems to me, changes the delivery system, if you will, and takes the program out of the Mueller rationale, the Mueller G. I. Bill exception, and back into the normal rule of leading, of having to bring about that submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.075" offset="8763411">And, I suggest that the vocational rehabilitation program we have here is exactly like that new G.I. Bill and, therefore, it cannot fall within the Mueller rationale, the Mueller exception, and the normal rule that you have to make the separation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.098" offset="9775604">Let's see how objective criteria might work in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.894" offset="9794725">Suppose again, on the basis of objective criteria, say Department of Labor data, the Episcopal Church, we find, has a surplus of priests and the Catholic Church has a shortage or there is a great need for Lutheran ministers but there doesn't seem to be much need at all for denominational ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.275" offset="9868286">Now, the vocational educational counselor then, right at the start, is going to have to say, I am sorry, I can't help you if you want to be Episcopalian, if you want to be an Episcopal priest, or a non-denomination minister, but if you want to be a Lutheran minister or a Catholic priest, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.019" offset="9947281">On the basis of these objective criteria, I can help you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.893" offset="9962745">Suppose one particular seminary or bible college has a great success rate in its placement of its graduates and suppose another one has a low success rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.419" offset="10020841">So, the voc/rehab counselor has to say to the student, though you really want to go to Seminary X.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.945" offset="10054905">I am sorry, if you want to be a minister or priest, you have to go to Seminary Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.754" offset="10082177">Suppose we had something like an objective test, say, put out by Educational Testing Service up in Princeton, similar to the LSAT for ministerial students.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.194" offset="12403940">I could justify 501(c)(3), Mr. Chief Justice, both under the type of Mueller rationale and under the Walz rationale, which I think are quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.157" offset="12451796">To get back to my counselor who is worried about the types of results that would come out under these so-called objective criteria, that counselor might well say, well, I am over my head, I don't know anything about this, and I am in an area that is religiously sensitive, I am going to get out of it, I am going to rely on the experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.772" offset="12550226">I will let them tell me whether or not this person has the aptitudes for the ministry, whether this school is the best school for this type of ministry, so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.580" offset="12597455">But, I would suggest who are those experts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.672" offset="12613860">Those experts have to be church and seminary or bible school officials themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.592" offset="12641550">So, once our counselor decides to do that, then it seems to me you walk right into a Grendel's den type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.728" offset="12678121">You have a type of delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.509" offset="12685227">So, it seems to me that however much you try, given the federal regulations and the state regulations that govern this program, there is no way to get out of this swamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.394" offset="12744786">There is no way to get out of this entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.596" offset="12761504">With respect to the Free Exercise Clause issue, again, I would just emphasize that a state should have the option under this Court's jurisprudence to say we do not want to fund ministerial students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.835" offset="12862546">That is what we have said in the religion clauses of our state Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.067" offset="12891385">And, I suggest that there is nothing in the Free Exercise Clause decisions of this Court which invalidate those decisions of the State of Washington as embodied in their Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.946" offset="13002980">In response to the arguments raised by the Respondent in this case, I would point out, first of all, that the G.I. Bill, unlike the contentions of the Respondent, is concerned with the career choice selected by the recipients of that Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.769" offset="13054285">As we pointed out in Footnote 20 of our opening brief, 38 U.S.C., Section 1673, lists a number of courses of study in career objectives which are excluded from the Bill's coverage, including any course in bartending, personality development, sales courses, etcetera, are types of courses that the G.I. Bill excludes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.480" offset="13129099">So, there is concern there by the Congress, just as there is concern by the state legislature, that people will pursue career choices that will lead to legitimate kinds of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.461" offset="13169014">Also to answer the Chief Justice's inquiry, the Solicitor's brief points out in Footnote 3 that Inland Empire School of the Bible is an eligible institution for people to enroll in the G.I. Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.517" offset="13225230">Turning to the meat of the Respondent's argument, they have argued based on speculation, as we suggested in our opening argument, about various kinds of things that might happen, could have happened, might happen under the career counseling that takes place, but they did not put any kind of this evidence in the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.274" offset="13316241">If they thought the federal Constitution or the federal statutes or the federal regulations gave them a source of defense of this claim, they could have and should have, we would submit, put the evidence in the record below and their failure to put that evidence in should not be charged to our account at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.109" offset="13387607">We think this case should be decided on the record and it should not be sent back for development of more facts, and, moreover, it should not be decided at all on speculation as engaged in by Respondent.</text>
