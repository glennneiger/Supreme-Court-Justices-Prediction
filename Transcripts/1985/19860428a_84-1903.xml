            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136540">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Puerto Rico Associates against Tourism Company of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="183351">Ms. Soto, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="maria_milagros_soto" startTime="15.860" stopTime="179.282">
            <label>Ms. Maria Milagros Soto</label>
            <text syncTime="15.860" offset="199965">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.712" offset="211355">This case presents a substantial question whether a statute of Puerto Rico violates the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution because it completely bans a franchise holder, a casino franchise holder, from advertising or otherwise offering its casino facilities to the public of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="290036">Without abandoning our Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment attacks on Section 8 of the Games of Chance Act of Puerto Rico, we have chosen to limit our argument to the First Amendment protection extended to truthful information about legal activities, and rely on our briefs for the remaining valid grounds, although in our minds, after living through the over-extensive obligation that Puerto Rico has given to the statute, we cannot characterize this ban as strictly commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="411766">The over-breadth and vagueness of the ban abridges, has abridged in the past, as the record shows, fully protected speech and public debate speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.416" offset="450114">Neither can we accept as valid the classification, subclassification, of a casino speech ban versus the public forum availability open to other gaining activities in Puerto Rico, nor the resident versus nonresident classification that the judgment below added to the original controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.299" offset="545722">However, argument on the First Amendment content based classification of the Act should persuade the Court to hold that casino advertising is protected by the United States Constitution, and that all truthful information about this legal activity cannot be blocked by Puerto Rico in an effort to keep its people uninformed as an extensive means of controlling through speech the activity of gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.837" offset="671841">The best example of the dangers inherent in over-broad prohibitions of speech, containing no guidelines of enforcement for the government, are given by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="726907">Section 8 of the statute reads:</text>
            <text syncTime="151.648" offset="743103">"No gambling room shall be permitted to advertise or otherwise offer its facilities in any manner whatsoever to the public in Puerto Rico. "</text>
            <text syncTime="163.522" offset="790542">In 30 years of enforcement, the government never defined what constituted advertising, nor who was the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.526" offset="818545">Neither did it clarify whether in Puerto Rico, including the tourist ones, he or she landed in Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.676" offset="1119162">--According to what the Judge decided, if it was aimed at the tourists it would not be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.949" offset="1152285">The problem is that the determination as to what the intent is would have to be based on content.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.270" offset="1185618">Each time that an advertisement or information about a casino is... comes across, and for instance, we brought to this Court's attention a case whereby even under the Court's construction now, as recently as after this Court had granted jurisdiction to hear this case, a supplement was published with information about the casino activities upon the opening of the second hotel, the El San Juan Hotel, that merely covered the facilities that were open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.491" offset="1310483">One page out of 52 that cover all the other facilities of the hotel was conceded by the government as casino advertising, and something that they had not done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.280" offset="1349562">They did not fine us this time, but they said that the case was being turned over for investigation for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.952" offset="1376311">Now, this statute is a criminal statute and this was a supplement by... an article by the newspaper was not an ad placed, as the Judge directed, and still it's being considered as advertising to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.343" offset="1425840">So an example that we still have the same problem.</text>

I'm familiar with it, but to go briefly through them, Posadas was fined for the first time when a supplement was published in the San Juan Star, an article about annexing the Laguna Wing to its already facilities, and there was an ad placed by our union, our casino union, that contained no message about promoting the casino, but that included the word "casino" as its trade name and a little drawing about a roulette in the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.667" offset="2903116">Tourism understood that was casino advertising, and it warned... Tourism warned Posadas that it was violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.921" offset="2932164">Because it did not get a reply from Posadas, a fine was imposed on the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.093" offset="2960899">This interpretation was immediately challenged by Posadas, but while a ruling was pending the gaming director wrote a letter to the president, then, that was stationed in Missouri, informing about the violations in the operations in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.103" offset="3020876">The president was quick to answer, but used stationery that had the word "casino" on it, and since the government understood that the word "casino" on letterhead is also advertising, a second fine was imposed on Posadas.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.415" offset="3098199">The third fine was imposed after the ruling came out and the ruling was upholding an absolute ban on speech, and because one of the guests that was staying in the hotel had a brochure that was left in his room and was handing it at the lobby, which was a public facility, to the government inspector, and they thought that was casino advertising also, and there was a third fine that was imposed on Posadas.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.613" offset="3194956">And the fourth fine really was a public debate issue where the president was holding a press conference and photographic session to protest legislation that proposed to ban the slot machines from Puerto Rico.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria Milagros Soto</label>
            <text syncTime="1064.655" offset="4395126">--I think so, because that's precisely why I brought the example of a recent case that happened just this December.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.809" offset="4419681">That was after the statute was construed, whereby under this interpretation and even after this Court had granted jurisdiction, or construed jurisdiction at least until the merits... they are still construing the statute that if it's addressed to the public of Puerto Rico it's prohibited, and here we are talking about a supplement that was in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.222" offset="4501392">Here we have a market that, although Puerto Rico is a secondary market, but we have only about a fifth of the tourists that come to Puerto Rico staying in hotels, and of those that stay in hotels only 60 to 70 percent stay in hotels with casinos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.880" offset="4556040">So, our market out there in Puerto Rico, of the tourists, is large, and how are we going to be able to juggle, how to get to the tourists without getting to the residents?</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.719" offset="4591358">And then, it's going to be an intent of whether, is it intended to the residents?</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.004" offset="4604524">Here is an English supplement, and we are being investigated for criminal prosecution this time, not only a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.360" offset="4633885">On the jurisdictional question which this Court would have me address, a facial attack on Section 8 was properly raised at every level of the proceeding, initially in the complaint, Paragraph 9 as stated, and throughout in the Notice of Appeal, Motion for Rehearing, and the Court acknowledged that in his own opinion when he said that the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were applicable to the question at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.642" offset="4731061">And, there are no independent state grounds for dismissal, expressed, at least on the merits... on the face of the judgment below, but rather that the Court dismissed the case for lack of a substantial question, which is a decision on the merits and therefore the decision is final and properly appealable to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.770" offset="4803577">Due to the time limitations we will rest on our briefs, on the rest of the jurisdictional questions, unless there is some concern of this Court, and we will move on to the substantiality of the question, which we think is very substantial as it abridges, first, commercial speech rights, it establishes a subclassification of casinos versus other legalized gaming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.719" offset="4891348">The classification is more suspect because it is a content based classification on speech, and it has raised now that the opinion below has come out of a second classification of residents versus non-residents, in addition of intruding into core speech rights because of its overbreadth and vagueness, violated due process guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.132" offset="4977030">The judgment below did not put to rest the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.834" offset="4995838">Therefore, we have to look into the merits of the ban itself and whether the government has met the burden that at least the Central Hudson test has imposed when abridgement of first commercial speech rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.331" offset="5069817">The activity is constitutionally protected because gaming has been legal in Puerto Rico since 1948, and there is no suggestion on the record that the information given is false or misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.704" offset="5111299">Whether the government has had a substantial interest is kind of vague, because the government has advanced five substantial interests up to this point, two in the original complaint which was that the tourists would be protected from the patronizing of the residents of the casino, which we fail to see how that could be, and also that the Puerto Rico residents would not promote tourism and do not contribute revenues to our economy, which is also not a serious argument, I don't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.021" offset="5220596">Then, we would say that income tax from state residents are not income to the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.091" offset="5244837">In its Motion to Affirm, it added that the government interest was to discourage the games of chance so that the Puerto Rican would earn his bread with the sweat of his brow, but that doesn't seem to be a substantial interest on the face that the government itself runs the state lottery, advertises it, allows it, very permissive with horse tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.270" offset="5329578">It's very permissive with cockfights, all of which are highly patronized by the Puerto Ricans, while the casinos are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.408" offset="5358104">This Court's level... for the first time, a tourism company brings, a casino information has no value in our free market society which is contrary to the Virginia holding and the progeny cases that follow, and that advertising will lead to excessive casino gambling with no factual basis at all on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.255" offset="5437516">These changes in substantial government really brings out the fact that it seems that the government is really fishing for a substantial interest that will uphold its own dislike of speech about gaming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.895" offset="5492060">But the true government goal, as read from Section 8, is a guard on a legal speaker and the election of public ignorance as a means of controlling legalized gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.639" offset="5543051">While the government has in the Act means that directly advance, such as minimum and maximum limits, strict supervision on a daily basis, no on-premise alcohol consumption, no minors allowed, a slot foreman to avoid slot houses, criminal sanctions for violating the law, credit procedures and controls, surveillance, and now IRS reporting on the Bank Secrecy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.456" offset="5646287">Other non-speech related controls and affirmative speech programs as suggested by Justice White may be adopted by Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.510" offset="5678574">That would directly advance these roles which we are not challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.462" offset="5694352">We do not mind the strict regulation of gaming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.747" offset="5703443">We just don't think that speech is the proper way of doing that, without unduly burdening the franchise holder entitled to conduct its business by the government inducing it for its own economic benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.905" offset="5752135">What Puerto Rico cannot do is deter gaming by blocking information about gaming in any manner, if addressed to the resident, because it is not the least restrictive means tailored to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.411" offset="5794140">The government has not met its burden, not a trial, not an argument which is really not evidence that would substitute trial evidence, for a departure from this Court's precedent on commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.587" offset="5850878">It merely relies on the word of Section 8, while we introduce at least the only study that has ever been made on gaming in Puerto Rico, it's in your brief, and which proves that just the opposite, as soon as gaming was regulated in Puerto Rico the former patronizing of the people of Puerto Rico of illegal casinos, which was 100 percent doing that, lost to five percent, because of the highly regulated nature of the gaming activity itself which is what we advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.891" offset="5984102">There is no substantial evidentiary ground for Tourism to request, or the government, that this activity be placed outside of the umbrella of the Constitution, together with illegal activities and together with child pornography and obscenity, because it's none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.068" offset="6048782">Gaming is legal in Puerto Rico, and there is no reason why this Court should backstep 11 years to the Bigelow versus Virginia era when truthful information about legal activity was totally suppressed, or was able to be totally possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.029" offset="6112625">As a matter of principle, a prophylactic ban on protected speech must withstand at least the intermediate scrutiny of Central Hudson which we just went through, although we prefer the view of the construction that the Constitution has made the choice of keeping the people of the United States informed as long as we are a free enterprise democracy, and Section 8 does not meet this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.776" offset="6199560">We would like to keep the remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.128" offset="6317007">The main issue here is the validity of a statute that restricts the advertising of casino gambling in Puerto Rico, and the first question that we must address is the scope of the restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.926" offset="6416168">Now, appellant is attacking here before this Court the statute, the 23-word statute, not the statute as it was interpreted by the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.055" offset="6484713">And, of course, that is the wrong approach because what the statute means must be determined by what the Superior Court decided that it means, and that interpretation is binding upon this Court as it has been decided by many, many precedents applicable to states, which are perfectly applicable to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court... or the Commonwealth Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.422" offset="6698186">And what is left may be described as follows: the Superior Court said that no advertisements of casinos addressed to residents of Puerto Rico would be allowed in general, when published in the local media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.177" offset="6829216">But then, it went on to make a series of exceptions, even to that general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.997" offset="6856488">It excepted, for example, advertisements which were distributed to residents if residents are clients of the hotel, not even guests, but clients, just people who are in the hotel premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.494" offset="6938512">So, if residents are in the hotel premises, there is no restriction at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.020" offset="10976520">The Superior Court did not even pass on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.489" offset="10994493">And the judgment issued by the Superior Court was merely, we issue now a declaratory judgment concerning the interpretation of this statute, where federal rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.467" offset="11062307">But, the specific challenge to the validity of the statute, to the authority to enact the statute, was never made before the Superior Court and was never made before the Supreme Court either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.612" offset="11138898">Now, the Supreme Court appeal, we have argued, was also untimely because it was filed too late, and the reply brief that appellant has filed is very significant, in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.264" offset="11253523">It does not present any rebuttal of the defects that have been pointed out in the appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.339" offset="11297827">It merely states, as a naked statement, that the appellees' claim was properly presented, and then it goes on to beg the indulgence of this Court, that the appellant was pressed for time, that the appellant decided at the very last moment to file an appeal before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and that that was why it didn't make things... it didn't do properly the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.597" offset="11450904">It didn't raise the constitutional issues as it should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.268" offset="11473578">But unfortunately for the appellant, as we all know, jurisdictional requirements cannot be dispensed with and cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.326" offset="11525823">He may have a perfect excuse otherwise for not doing the right things, but if he didn't do it then there is no jurisdiction and that is what we claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.835" offset="11579844">Now, the... going to the merits, I would like to state in simple terms our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.941" offset="11616207">The main position of the appellees in this case is that First Amendment protection should not be extended under the commercial free speech doctrine to advertising of casino gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.771" offset="11703560">And the reasons in support of that position are in brief, that gambling and casino gambling is an activity that is harmful to the community, that it is a vice-strewn activity, and that Puerto Rico should have the power to legalize casino gambling if it believes that, for example, it is unwise or impractical to prohibit it altogether because people will gamble anyway, or because it expects to derive some economic benefit from the legalization of casino gambling, but that there should be no requirement that then Puerto Rico should allow casinos, to promote and to actively advertise and market their services and their products so as to create new gamblers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.823" offset="12019747">And the same would apply, I would suppose, to the marijuana case that was put by Justice O'Connor, because a state is allowed to legalize marijuana but it is prohibited from telling people, "Don't advertise marijuana", then new persons who consume marijuana will be encouraged to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.615" offset="12170943">I mean, it's not... the state will not be able to limit the legalization to what the existing demand for marijuana or gambling or casino gambling is at the time that it is legalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.276" offset="12245549">In our case, the situation is very, very difficult because there's no doubt that casino gambling is a very dangerous activity, that it attracts and has attracted, in Nevada and Atlantic City, it has attracted the crime gamblers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.398" offset="12374071">It has attracted organized crime, and provoked a host of other problems concerning law and order including among others the corruption of government officials, as the Abscam investigation showed in Atlantic City where the senior Senator, federal Senator was involved in taking bribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.029" offset="12892654">If Puerto Rico cannot prohibit the marketing and advertising of casino gambling, then it is faced with a tremendous problem because the experience in Nevada and Atlantic City shows that when you open up the floodgates of advertising and promotion, the casinos, the gambling casinos take over.</text>
