            <text syncTime="10.809" offset="169732">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.636" offset="185092">The Federal government operates over 100 hydroelectric dams on the nation's waterways that generate electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.022" offset="210588">This case concerns the scope of the Secretary of Energy's authority to set the rates at which this power is sold to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.911" offset="238173">Specifically, the question presented here is whether the Secretary may place a rate increase into effect on an interim basis pending a final determination regarding the propriety of the new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.672" offset="285194">In April 1978, the Southwestern Power Administration, the entity whose rates are in dispute, issued a public notice of a proposed rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.309" offset="323750">The notice stated that the SWPA was running a deficit of approximately $20 million and proposed a tentative 42 percent rate increase to enable the SWPA's revenues to cover its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.382" offset="372025">The notice solicited written comments and the SWPA subsequently held public meetings to inform interested parties about the proposed rate increase and to obtain oral comments concerning the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.346" offset="419881">After considering the public comments, the SWPA reduced the rate increase to 33 percent and submitted it to the Assistant Secretary of Energy for his approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.216" offset="459378">The Assistant Secretary reviewed the public comments and observed that this was the first rate increase in the SWPA's general rates in over 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.464" offset="496367">He concluded that the rate increase satisfied the applicable statutory standard because it would generate revenues that would equal but not exceed the SWPA's costs of generating the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.785" offset="541716">The Assistant Secretary therefore issued an order confirming and approving the rates and placing them into effect on an interim basis pending final action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.705" offset="585393">The Assistant Secretary's order specified that customers who paid the interim rates would receive a refund with interest if a lower rate eventually was placed into effect by the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.247" offset="631473">The FERC again solicited public comments regarding the rates and at first issued a decision disapproving the rates because they were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.150" offset="667104">It founds that the rates in fact would not generate revenues equal to the SWPA's costs of producing the electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.583" offset="696883">After reviewing additional data that was subsequently submitted in support of the rates, the FERC reversed itself and approved the new rates in January 1982, 33 months after the rates had been placed into effect on an interim basis by the Assistant Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.124" offset="763025">Respondents commenced this action in the Court of Claims seeking to recover the money paid pursuant to the rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.323" offset="791865">They did not... do not challenge the amount of the rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.556" offset="808792">They argue only that the Assistant Secretary cannot place rates into effect on an interim basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.758" offset="829585">The Court of Claims held that the Secretary lacked the statutory authority to place interim rates into effect and that Respondents' contracts with the United States also barred the interim rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.018" offset="874620">Following a remand to it for the calculation of damages, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reached the same conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.120" offset="959048">They are examined by the Assistant Secretary who issues an order directing the customers to pay the rate increase, but providing that the rate, that those amounts are subject to refund if the &lt;FERC&gt; [= FERC], which then considers the rate increase, determines that it is too high and substitutes a lower rate increase.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.408" offset="1024145">What the Assistant Secretary was asking for is the pattern that was familiar with the Interstate Commerce Commission when tariffs were filed, was it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.734" offset="1061448">The tariff would take effect immediately until the Commission set it aside, but you say that's not permitted here?</text>

            <text syncTime="244.386" offset="1104080">Well, this case, this case is... in the Interstate Commerce Commission example, and indeed, in private utility regulation, the utility typically files a rate which will take effect but is subject to suspension by the relevant regulatory body.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.847" offset="1185896">I don't believe that it's impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.595" offset="1196867">I think that the utility is under, simply under an obligation to repay the money if it is eventually found that the rate increase is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.248" offset="1227482">Here the rate before it is placed into effect is actually measured by the government, by the Assistant Secretary of Energy, against the applicable statutory standard here, the standard that rates should be set at a level that recoup revenues but don't provide any provide to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.742" offset="1289445">So here customers are actually in a better position than they are in typical regulation because the rates already have been assessed for their propriety by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.801" offset="1321732">So it is especially peculiar that in this context, where the rates already have been evaluated, even before they go into effect on an interim basis, the courts below found that the Secretary doesn't have this interim rate-setting authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.805" offset="2993778">The Fifth Circuit said, in fact, that in its view the Court of Claims had simply misread the statute, and it pointed out the reasons that it was clear from the statute that the Federal Power Commission's authority had been transferred to the Secretary of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.487" offset="3048426">The Court of Claims invalidated the rest of its decision invalidating the rates on three bases, most of which we've talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.263" offset="3099626">First, it found that the interim rate increases were barred under the contracts, but as I've discussed, the contract provisions simply provide that the Secretary of Energy may exercise his full statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.243" offset="3147482">So really there is no separate contract question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.382" offset="3160021">The contract question is the same as the statutory question, whether the Secretary has the statutory authority to impose interim rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.130" offset="3187084">The second ground relied upon by the Court of Claims is its view that Congress did not transfer the Federal Power Commission's authority to the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.188" offset="3227313">However, as the Fifth Circuit pointed out and as we demonstrate in our briefs, it's quite clear that the Department of Energy Organization Act expressly transfers that authority to the Secretary of Energy, and that the FERC's involvement in this process is solely by virtue of the fact that the Secretary determined that review by the FERC was appropriate in his delegation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.867" offset="3314039">So the only issue really in this case is whether the Secretary has the authority to place rates into effect on an interim basis, and we think that that authority is supported on two separate grounds: first of all, on the basis of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act which broadly empowered the Secretary of the Interior to sell electricity at the lowest possible rates to consumers, consistent with sound business principles, and in using such a general term to describe the scope of the Secretary's authority, Congress plainly intended to give the Secretary substantial leeway in selecting the manner in which to administer this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.133" offset="3463042">Basically Congress... this is a proprietary program selling Federal property, and Congress has directed the Secretary to dispose of it in whatever manner he thought appropriate consistent with the way a business would dispose of a similar asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.595" offset="3520929">And Respondents have presented no reason that interim rate increases should be excluded from this broad grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.657" offset="3545171">And in fact, interim rate increases are a typical conventional ratemaking procedure, and rate regulation schemes governing private utilities typically provide that rates may be placed into effect on an interim basis pending the final regulatory determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.601" offset="3608909">And the reason for that rule is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.132" offset="3623016">The judgment has been made that the regulated utilities should not be required to bear the burden of financial... of the loss of revenues due to regulatory delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.565" offset="3664811">And interim rates allow the utility to obtain the revenue that it needs and at the same time safeguard the customer's rights because the customer is entitled generally to a refund with interest if the regulatory body later finds that a lower rate is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.403" offset="3728132">The Federal Power Act, for example, permits private utilities to file their rates and permits the rates to go into effect on an interim basis, subject to a refund if the lower rate is adopted by the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.882" offset="3778078">We think it would be anomalous to construe Section 5 in a manner that deprived the Federal Government of this ratesetting technique.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.754" offset="3809530">Mr. Pincus, what evidence is there that under the old scheme, before there was a Department of Energy, that the Federal Power Authority interpreted the Act as giving it the power to set interim rates?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="935.623" offset="3868985">Your Honor, there are three examples, three cases in which the Federal Power Commission did set rates into effect on an interim basis, one example under this statute, one example under the very similar language of the statutes governing the Bonneville power projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.302" offset="3935754">I think that those interpretations of the statute by the administrative entity that administered it are entitled to deference and show that the position for which we contend is the appropriate interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.064" offset="3990820">And Respondents make much of the fact that those are the only examples, but this Court has held several time that the mere fact that an agency has not exercised its power does not mean that the power doesn't exist, and we think that is all that is true of the situation cited by Respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.696" offset="4065321">Respondents' basic argument that Section 5 does not confer interim rate authority is their claim that the statutory provision, the statute bars the rates by providing that rate schedules become effective upon confirmation and approval by the Federal Power Commission, but we think this language simply has nothing to do with any prohibition of interim rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.200" offset="4183290">All the statute... the statute does not require complete administrative action before the rates are placed into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.229" offset="4215473">It simply requires a decision by the Federal Power Commission or the entity that exercises the Federal Power Commission's confirmation and approval authority here, the Assistant Secretary, and here the Assistant Secretary did specifically that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.457" offset="4272315">Before the interim rates went into effect, he issued an order discussing whether the rates met the statutory standard and expressly confirming and approving the rates on an interim basis, and we think that is all that the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.077" offset="4318813">There simply is no requirement that all administrative action be completed before the rates are placed into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.184" offset="4343264">In addition, it's clear that Congress' purpose in requiring the Federal Power Commission to act is not at all furthered by requiring final approval of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.694" offset="4401256">All that Congress wanted was the Federal Power Commission to apply its expertise in evaluating a rate before the rate was placed into effect, and that's exactly what happens under our interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.203" offset="4455381">Before an interim rate is placed into effect the rate is evaluated under the statutory standard by the government entity that possesses that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.731" offset="4489445">I would also like to briefly address our second argument, that independent of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, the Secretary's now plenary authority over the rates under the Department of Energy Organization Act also permits the Secretary to use interim rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.426" offset="4580247">We think that this Court has recognized that this type of plenary authority carries with it the authority place rates into effect on an interim basis when that is necessary to serve the public interest, and we think that that is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.793" offset="4645657">Interim rates serve the public interest, especially in this case where the SWPA's revenues had fallen so far behind in recouping its costs, and do not harm consumers because the consumers, first of all, have the right to comment on the rates before they go into effect, have the review of the rates by the Assistant Secretary, again before the rates go into effect, and have the final level of review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a refund if the FERC decides that the interim rate was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.312" offset="4767806">In that situation, we think there's simply no reason to deprive the government of the right to place interim rates into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.856" offset="4797899">Unless the Court has any questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.882" offset="6294088">That's what we think the Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, Justice White, requires, and the Fifth Circuit in its construction of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, if you read the opinion closely, seemed to reach the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.013" offset="6374545">They got a different result, not under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act but saying the Department of Energy Act modified and amended Section 5 of the Flood Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.898" offset="6430134">So it is the Fifth Circuit which alone of all the courts that considered this, have said interim rates are possible, has reached that result on the basis of the decision of Congress in their minds in the DOE Act, but when you track through the exact provisions of the DOE Act, an it was only a transfer, the legislative history was quite clear that it was not to be an amendment of the prior laws, the prior statutes, and each of the exact provisions of the DOE Act, we think that the Federal Circuit reached a better opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.691" offset="6781324">It could either act... veto it... just, Mr. Ickes in his appearance before the Committee when the Section 5 was being debated in its predecessor Act, the Bonneville Act, said quite expressly that it was a veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.247" offset="6843496">It required final action by the Federal Power Commission, but it was a limited authority to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.870" offset="6874007">It was not a plenary grant of authority like the Interstate Commerce Commission has or like the Federal Power Commission has under their express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.413" offset="6920191">Now, had Congress in 1944 in passing Section 5 of the Flood Control Act intended to grant the power to either the Secretary or to the Federal Power Commission to grant interim rates, it could have used the language that it had before it in the earlier Natural Gas Act of 1938 or the Federal Power Act of 1935, also the Interstate Commerce Act had express provisions in it that allow for interim rates and authorize interim rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.259" offset="7059580">Section 5 of the Flood Control Act did not intend to do that, and I think the reasons for it are set forth in the analysis that the Fifth Circuit made of Section 5 wherein I think the Fifth Circuit came up with the conclusion that there wasn't any authority in the Flood Control Act of 1944 to permit interim rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.773" offset="7217569">Well, I think that the delay, Mr. Rehnquist, was a result of procedures which the Secretary of Energy and the &lt;FERC&gt; [= FERC], he could have increased, shortened that time considerably, and they have shortened it since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.092" offset="7302937">Furthermore, in the long history after the Flood Control Act was enacted, in '44, in all of the dealings with the cities under the SWPA, over that entire period of time up to the instance in this case, at no time did SWPA ever sought to issue an interim rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.646" offset="7397082">That's up to '79.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.145" offset="7407114">After the Court of Claims decision in this case in '82, SWPA went back to its old practice of not issuing interim rates, and in 1983 they issued a rate that was not an interim rate, and if the Court can take judicial notice of SWPA's annual report for 1984, they have done very well indeed since they've been following the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.618" offset="7517037">The report states... this is the annual report for '84... I'm pleased to report the Southwestern Power Administration was financially healthy when the books were closed at the end of fiscal 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.393" offset="7576074">We received record revenues of $100.5 million, of which $93.2 million was deposited with the U.S. Treasury, assisting in reduction of the federal deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.717" offset="7621422">This may be compared to the $52 million in funds appropriated by Congress for operation of the Southwestern Power system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.183" offset="7655277">Of this revenue, $21.8 million was available for debt retirement, which also, is also a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.118" offset="7687042">Our previous accumulated debt retirement was $39.9 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.007" offset="7706581">These records were achieved in a year of slightly less than average electric energy generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.802" offset="7733749">So I think this report which was based on rates that were issued without violating the express language of the contracts of the cities, shows that SWPA through the Department of Energy and utilizing a procedure without interim rates, can operate to keep its books in balance and to do well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.103" offset="7822983">Now, the question of the contract itself, this case is one of the first cases to reach this Court from the new Federal Circuit, and Congress has set up that Court to have expertise in matters such as this dealing with the meaning of federal contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.607" offset="7940952">We have the result of both the Court of Claims before it was abolished and the Federal Circuit Court of appeals construing the language of the contract in this case as on its claimed language precluding a rate increase to these cities until such time as there have been a final confirmation and approval by the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.890" offset="8074072">Now, that contract construction where the Court subsequently went into the course of conduct between the parties over the long period of time that the contracts had been in effect I think is entitled to great deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.916" offset="8138229">The findings that both the Court of Claims and the Federal Circuit reached on the meaning of these contracts and the plain language and the course of conduct is within their scope of expertise to review and consider federal contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.410" offset="8200191">The Fifth Circuit in its opinion really didn't analyze the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.891" offset="8234046">It really simply analyzed the statutory, and just assumed that the contracts would follow its construction of the subsequent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.900" offset="8286082">We think that the Fifth Circuit was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.399" offset="8304158">There was a long pattern of conduct that started after the Flood Control Act was issued, where no interim rates were issued by SWPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.924" offset="8358180">We have listed the cases at pages 36 and 37 from 1947 on up to the '70s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.545" offset="8400707">Throughout all of those cases until the present case, SWPA never sought an interim rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.240" offset="8631525">Well, it could be that is so, but certainly when the Power Act and the Gas Act were enacted in 1935, Congress put in express interim rate authority, and it seems strange that in 1944, which is a few years after that, they didn't put the same authority in there if they thought it was important and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.701" offset="8721282">And I think the reason they thought it wasn't necessary was... goes back to Secretary Ickes' concept in his sponsorship of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.446" offset="8768302">He wanted a bifurcated system to review, but he wanted the Federal Power Commission review to be quite limited, and they would only have the limited function of approving, and they did not have any broad plenary functions like the Federal Power Commission would have or the Interstate Commerce Commission would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.297" offset="8839669">And he wanted them also... he was very explicit about this, that they had to have the final say, that the rate could not go into effect, and we've cited his comments on this in our brief, until there was a final order by the Federal Power Commission, and that one ingredient is missing here even after the DOE Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.930" offset="8922216">The Secretary of Energy, in his wisdom, decided that the wanted to delegate the function of confirmation and approval back to the FERC which was the successor agency to the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.752" offset="8981566">So he delegated that in his order, and at that point you come back to the express language of the contracts and the Flood Control Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.919" offset="9022212">But you take the position that even had there been no delegation to FERC, no interim rate would be possible, is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Wheatley, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2230.916" offset="9050216">I think that that is true because the Department of Energy Act, when it was enacted, simply transferred the situation as it existed under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, to the Secretary of the Energy, and it's true that at that point the Secretary of the Energy had the power, the limited review and confirmation power of the FPC plus the power that the Secretary of Interior had under the Flood Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.153" offset="9175185">He had both those powers, but those powers were never plenary under the Flood Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.401" offset="9196083">The power to confirm rates was not changed substantively, and all Congress did in the DOE Act was transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.945" offset="9234327">They simply transferred what existed previously and didn't augment and increase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.223" offset="9255434">And the Court reports and the Chairman of the bill, when it was enacted, made it quite clear they were not creating any new substantive power and authority in the Secretary of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.468" offset="9308410">Well, the further sections relating to the DOE Act is 301(b) and 302(a)(1), both of those simply transferred functions, and as the Federal Circuit recognized, the meaning of the word "transfer" is clear, and it does not permit a definition that permits the augmentation of the prior powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.500" offset="9464518">Now, nothing in the transfer gave any additional authority in addition to the Section 5 language, and also, there was a Section 501(a) of the DOE Act which expressly provided that any procedural requirements under any prior law that were transferred that were in addition to that which the DOE had itself were to remain intact and in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.518" offset="9592622">This clearly brought with it the limitations that were implied or were expressed in the 1944 Act requiring final confirmation and approval by the Secretary or... and his delegee, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.039" offset="9686663">I mentioned earlier the legislative history of the DOE Act also where Chairman Brooks, who was the floor manager, said the Secretary would not have any powers not already created by Congress, and that's cited at page 40 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.515" offset="9784570">And Chairman Dunham of the Federal Power Commission in the Senate hearings relating to the DOE Act said he could separate reorganization from substantive authority and he looked and construed the DOE Act as simply a reorganization act and not as an act investing the DOE with any additional authorities other than that which it had under the transferred acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.424" offset="9896269">Now, the government's position that the consolidation of the Flood Control Act and the DOE Act gives plenary authority over rate increases and interim rate authority we think is patently wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.901" offset="9970144">And the decision by the Federal Circuit below adopted a District Court opinion in the Sam Rayburn Dam case, where that issue was gone over very carefully and clearly shows and demonstrates that the DOE Act did not intend to augment any powers that were previously involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.263" offset="10103577">But regardless of the legislative history, I think there's one bottom line that comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.822" offset="10137850">That is that when the Secretary delegated his authority for the final approval and confirmation, he was at that point, to the FERC, at that point until that final approval and confirmation took place, there was no completion of the exact event which the statutory language in the Flood Control Act, which is still valid, had taken, had occurred, it would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.575" offset="10268776">Well, I think that that completes my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.866" offset="10333977">Unless there are further questions, I will just relinquish the rest of my time.</text>
