            <label>Mr. Cabanne Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="56.634" offset="362995">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.196" offset="373235">The issue in this case is whether the State of Maine, consistent with the Commerce Clause, may prohibit the importation of live baitfish for the purpose of protecting its environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.377" offset="421927">The case is here on the State's appeal from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which declared the state statute unconstitutional for failing to survive the strict scrutiny test required by this Court in Hughes versus Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.168" offset="485039">This Court subsequently postponed jurisdiction over the appeal until this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.525" offset="506459">After a brief summary of the relevant facts and a statement of why this Court has jurisdiction, I would like to explain why the Court of Appeals misapplied the proper standard for appellate review of factual findings in district court set forth in Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and why the Court also subjected the Maine statute to an unnecessarily strict standard of constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.170" offset="621085">The State of Maine has a small and unique freshwater fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.402" offset="646058">It is available to all residents and non-residents alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.323" offset="661731">To protect that fishery, in 1959 the State's legislature passed a statute which is at issue in this case to protect the fishery against the importation of diseased fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.926" offset="712095">In 1981, Congress passed the Lacey Act Amendment of that year, making it a federal crime to engage in interstate commerce in violation of statutes such as Maine's.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.499" offset="766430">In February of 1983, the Defendant in this case was indicted for importing and 158,000 baitfish, some of which contained various diseases about which the state was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.260" offset="821496">The Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of the underlying state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.710" offset="843230">The state was permitted to intervene pursuant to Title 28 United States Code, Section 2403(b) in order to defend its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.112" offset="880846">An evidentiary hearing was held before a United States magistrate and the state and federal government introduced substantial expert testimony showing that its statute satisfied both prongs of the Hughes versus Oklahoma test, those being that the statute was needed to protect the state against various parasites and exotic species which could come in through a shipment of live bait, and, secondly, that there was no alternative to an absolute ban on the importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.756" offset="1007383">The district court and... The magistrate and subsequently the district court agreed with the state and sustained the statute, but the Court of Appeals, asserting its freedom to re-evaluate the evidence completely, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.313" offset="1065689">The state then appealed to this Court, although the United States government did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.248" offset="1085437">The state believes that this case is covered by the plain language 28 United State Code, Section 1254(2) which gives this Court jurisdiction, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="248.915" offset="1132040">"by appeal by a party relying on a state statute held by a court of appeals to be invalid. "</text>
            <text syncTime="255.772" offset="1159521">On the merits, on the question of the adequacy of the evidence to support the district court's finding, the state believes that with regard to the... that the principle error created by the Court of Appeals in this case was a decision in effect to retry the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.342" offset="1241754">The state's evidence here was overwhelming that the statute met both prongs of the Hughes test.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.386" offset="1265996">With regard to the legitimate purpose behind the statute, the state fish pathologist and two other expert... academic experts testified that the statute was needed to guard against both three specific parasites which could establish themselves in Maine's sport fish such as trout, bass, and salmon, and also that the statute was needed to protect against the introduction of exotic species such as, for example, the common carp, which might successfully compete with indigenous species for habitat.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.793" offset="1415625">The same witnesses, as well as the Defendant's own expert, testified as to the second prong of the Hughes test; that the scientific community has not established a testing program of any kind for baitfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.037" offset="1480513">And, since that is the case, since there is no possibility of inspecting fish or testing fish--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="691.595" offset="2902828">I think it is important to know whether there is some framework here for a disagreement on the legal standard between the district court and the First Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Cabanne Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="701.483" offset="2942325">--I didn't get the impression from reading the district court's opinion that the district court... rather reading the Court of Appeals' opinion that it was disagreeing with what the district court had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.307" offset="2977643">I think the Court of Appeals agreed that the district court was applying the strict scrutiny test and in applying the test it is fair enough to say that if there is doubt among the scientific community as to what the status of science is, that that ought to be enough to give the state a legitimate purpose in legislating against uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.111" offset="3052876">So, I don't see a difference between the two at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.342" offset="3081819">As I was saying a second ago, the prohibition... the needs of this prohibition in this case is required because of the absolute testing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.024" offset="3136468">The evidence that the district court found was that there is no testing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.086" offset="3152768">So, in short, the state feels that it satisfied the Hughes test in this case no matter how strictly one wants to state it.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.439" offset="3194146">And, in fact, the Hughes test can't be satisfied on the evidence in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.219" offset="3217238">It probably is a test that nobody can satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.110" offset="3228837">Now, beyond this, the state also suggests that the strict scrutiny test of Hughes may not be appropriate to apply in this case for the reason that the Congress enacted the Lacey Act Amendments in 1981 which encouraged the states to pass statutes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.867" offset="3303860">And, if the courts were to continue to apply the strict scrutiny test to statutes like this, that would frustrate the will of Congress in passing the Lacey Act Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.159" offset="3349000">In short, there is a need to harmonize the policy of Congress in encouraging statutes like this with, of course, the policy of the Commerce Clause to prevent the economic vulcanization of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.608" offset="3394871">In our brief, we have suggested that there is a way in which the Court could fashion a lower degree of scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.464" offset="3426218">We are not arguing that there should be no scrutiny at all, of course, but we do argue that there should be a lesser degree of scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.540" offset="3450564">For example, on the question of legitimate purpose, we think that the proper way under the Lacey Act to approach a case like this would be to presume that the state statute, that the state legislature has acted for the legitimate purpose that it says and put the burden on the Defendant to come in with some evidence that there is some illegitimate purpose going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.094" offset="3524752">And, similarly, on the question of whether there is an adequate alternative, the state should be given a little bit more leeway than being required to adopt any hypothetical alternative that the Court of Appeals might be able to think up.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.635" offset="3586923">In conclusion, the state believes that the Commerce Clause should not require it to take the risk that the indiscriminate importation of baitfish would not be harmful to its environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.365" offset="3633839">If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.708" offset="3803217">The district court found that the fact remains that there is no testing technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.893" offset="3827981">The Court of Appeals did not find that finding to be clearly erroneous and, in fact, Appellee Taylor does not contest to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.606" offset="3878868">His brief in this Court on page 25 says simply that there are procedures that could be developed.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Paul Eggert</label>
            <text syncTime="1504.468" offset="6154237">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.920" offset="6168134">Mr. Taylor in the court below has attacked the constitutionality of the state statute which forbids the importation of baitfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.806" offset="6211602">He has done that in a fairly unique circumstance of being in the midst of a federal criminal prosecution and attacking a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.582" offset="6258727">As background for that particular challenge, Mr. Taylor has been in the bait business for approximately 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.329" offset="6293731">He has raised in the State of Maine baitfish and mainly golden shiners during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.622" offset="6326854">They are, indeed, the same type of species of golden shiners that he was attempting to import in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.479" offset="6362277">The reason Mr. Taylor is importing golden shiners from other states is due to the reality of aquaculture in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.332" offset="6409715">Maine has a harsh winter, a short warm season during which fish may be raised and harvested and the fish selling cycle is just the opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.359" offset="6457885">Maine fishermen can fish year around with live bait, but they do not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.014" offset="6480454">Mainly, they fish in winter, ice fish with live bait, and that is the peak season for Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.526" offset="6510548">It is very difficult for Mr. Taylor to raise golden shiners and keep them over the winter to supply the demand of his customers, and, therefore, in order to remain in business and to grow in his business as the demand of the marketplace dictates, he has been forced to go outside the state during winter months to bring back in golden shiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.610" offset="6602812">The initial question that is before this Court as I understand it is a matter of jurisdiction which has been reserved to this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.182" offset="6657147">Our position on jurisdiction is that Section &lt;twelve fifty-four two&gt; [= 1254(2)] is not as clear cut as the state would have us believe, but, in fact, that particular statute does not apply to criminal cases, which this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.737" offset="6735305">It is a criminal appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.878" offset="6739903">And, that that statute applies only to civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.048" offset="6756621">That is clear in the legislative history of that statute and in the very language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.905" offset="6783997">That does not mean that this Court cannot hear the merits of this particular case, but that we would contend that the Court must treat this as a petition for Writ of Certiorari and we would further contend that this question is not important enough for the Court of grant that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.319" offset="6857663">All parties in this particular case, I think, agree that this statute that we are talking about is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.782" offset="6915550">It is a flat prohibition against the importation of baitfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.045" offset="6932582">It stops it at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.700" offset="6943240">What is being prohibited is something that the state allows all the time to go on within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.508" offset="6998410">Golden shiners are a common baitfish within the State of Maine and outside the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.769" offset="7023488">Once this discriminatory effect of the statute has been admitted by all parties, the constitutional law which... the body of constitutional law which has surrounded the analysis of the statute indicates that the courts must look at the statute and the proposed justification for the statute with strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.087" offset="7144801">We would contend that the district court, through the magistrate's findings, and also the district court's findings, gave lip service to that strict scrutiny standard and said that they were applying the strict scrutiny standard and, in effect, were merely adopting the opinions of the state's experts because they really didn't have any basis for distinguishing between or finding one expert's opinion to be more correct than the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.602" offset="7294848">They fell back to the position that the state has proposed these problems as their legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.802" offset="7339570">The Defendants contest that, but we are not really sure, therefore, we will accept the state at face value and allow the statute to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.281" offset="7381574">We contend that the Court must do more than that, that the Court must not just make findings perhaps on a preponderance of the evidence standard or maybe even a lesser standard in this particular case, as what the court did, but they must make those findings and then look and scrutinize those findings in the context of everything else that was presented in the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.456" offset="7514277">I think this Court does, indeed, have to go back to the transcript to look at the evidence that was presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.014" offset="7552415">Well, Mr. Eggert, in the brief you suggest that under a Commerce Clause analysis that clear and convincing evidence is the standard to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.055" offset="7616677">I think I may have been analogizing that when that is the standard and the lower court... When a clear and convincing standard is evidenced as the standard, and the lower court has obviously misapplied that standard, that the Appellate Court then has to look at the record, the factual record, and make a determination for itself from that record whether or not the lower court is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.758" offset="7767455">The Court must go further than that and apply those facts to the statute and that is where the strict scrutiny comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.458" offset="7794205">It is not enough that the Court say, yes, we agree, for instance, that there is a parasite which could be introduced into the State of Maine through importation of baitfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.875" offset="7839867">It goes further than that to find out if that is a sufficient reason for blocking commerce at Maine's border.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.996" offset="8364405">It went to Maine's statutory and regulatory structure to see whether or not Maine's avowed purpose with this statute was at all consistent with what they do with other fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.406" offset="8474015">However, there is a bit of prejudice, I believe, involved in that particular conception and that is that somehow the baitfish dealers in Arkansas are not as careful and good as the trout raisers in Maryland, let's say, without much justification for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.543" offset="11938583">That is uncontradicted on this record which leads me to respond to an earlier question from Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.602" offset="11974841">You were concerned, as I recall, about whether there is a difference in the test that the district court and the Court of Appeals applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.553" offset="12002636">I had a chance to reread the Court of Appeals' opinion during the other arguments and I can't see anything in there that indicates that the Court of Appeals criticized the district court on its application of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.608" offset="12050805">And, furthermore, the point on which the Court of Appeals reversed; that is that there was other means that the state hadn't sought and found to protect itself, that point is one in which there is no disagreement in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.245" offset="12109424">There is no evidence at all that there is no test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.291" offset="12121545">The record is unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.195" offset="12137219">The disagreement occurs on the point as to whether there is a risk, whether there is a real risk or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.505" offset="12162401">The Defendant's experts on that issue tried to make the point that there was a difficulty on the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.206" offset="12185284">But, that wasn't the point on which the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.735" offset="12199390">So, it doesn't seem that there is a problem with regard to the application of the test in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.311" offset="12225617">And, as to the question about the risk, Justice Stevens, I think you were concerned that the district court didn't make findings about that and if I could just direct your attention to a paragraph on page D-7 of the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.411" offset="12310045">It is in the middle of the page, the first full paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.958" offset="12320285">I think that is the paragraph where the court is finding that... having cited the testimony above it... the court is coming to the conclusion that given the somewhat unique characteristics associated with the Maine fish population, the substantial uncertainties surrounding the effects and so on shows that there is a risk.</text>
