            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147564">We will hear arguments first this morning in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation against Philadelphia Gear Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="184971">Mr. Rothfeld, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="12.729" stopTime="125.348">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="12.729" offset="198451">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.062" offset="211721">The issue in this case is a narrow one, whether a standby letter of credit issued by a bank and backed by a contingent note provided by the bank's customer represents a deposit that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.563" offset="269713">While this question obviously is a technical one, reduced to its essentials, the issue here is actually very straightforward, and can be resolved by simply bearing in mind the central purpose of the deposit insurance program, protecting funds that depositors entrust to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.924" offset="331257">This case is typical of commercial transactions that make use of so-called standby letter of credit to guarantee credit by one of the parties, and a look at the facts of the transaction here may help put the issue in focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.284" offset="384651">The case began when the Orion Manufacturing Corporation arranged to purchase materials from the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.989" offset="411505">To guarantee that it would pay for the materials when they were delivered, Orion obtained a standby letter of credit from the Penn Square Bank for the benefit of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.995" offset="447450">This letter of credit, like all letters of credit, functioned as a guarantee mechanism, and worked very much like a line of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.059" offset="479737">Under the letter, Penn Square was obligated to pay respondent upon the receipt of respondent's signed statement that Orion hadn't paid its bills to respondent when those bills came due.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.837" offset="518816">As security for Penn Square, Orion gave the bank a contingent so-called backup note in the amount of the letter of credit which the bank would draw upon for reimbursement if it was forced to pay out to respondent under the letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.697" offset="578271">Although this note was labeled a promissory note and on its face appeared uncontingent, both Orion and Penn Square understood that nothing would be considered due on the note and the note would bear no interest unless and until the bank was forced to pay respondent under the letter of credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.302" offset="1280756">First, the note certainly was meaningful as a reimbursement agreement between Orion, the maker of the note, and the bank, and the only rights the bank had under the note, given the whole nature of the transaction here, were that it could use the note to obtain reimbursement.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.495" offset="2729507">That, I think, refers to the bank, the bank receiving the promissory note in exchange for the letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.262" offset="2764511">The focus of Section 1813(L)(1) defines the term deposit and the deposit insurance program as a whole is whether the bank has received something of value which it is holding for its customer, and it is put at risk in the event of a bank failure, and that is why the nature of the note in our view is important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.324" offset="2848834">I think an example may make our position clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.496" offset="2861477">If, for example, a customer gives a bank a $1,000 uncontingent promissory note in exchange for a bank instrument such as a certificate of deposit, which is one of the instruments listed with letters of credit in the deposit definition, and the bank then fails, the customer will have lost $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.319" offset="2932740">The certificate of deposit will have lost its value, and the promissory note, which is uncontingent, will end up in the hands of the bank's receiver, who will be free to collect $1,000 in cash from the bank's customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.517" offset="2981536">The bank's customer will be in the same position as if he had given the bank $1,000 cash for the certificate of deposit, had lost that $1,000 when the bank failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.612" offset="3009957">That customer obviously is entitled to the protection of deposit insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.563" offset="3025735">In contrast, if the bank customer gives the bank a contingent backup note of the kind at issue here in exchange for a letter of credit or a line of credit and the bank fails, the customer has lost nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.345" offset="3088847">He can no longer draw on the letter of credit or the line of credit, but he will never have to pay out on the note, because the note will end up in the hands of the bank's receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.190" offset="3124269">It will be essentially in the position of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.061" offset="3131793">It will be unable to collect on it, because the bank has never paid out on the line of credit or the letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.755" offset="3150496">He will not have lost money or its equivalent, which is the central definitional phrase in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.158" offset="3180171">He won't be out of pocket a cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.139" offset="3188113">I think if you look at the line of credit situation, it is obvious that the customer shouldn't be able to demand that the FDIC insure his right to draw on a line of credit, but that essentially is what respondent was asking for here, because a standby letter of credit is in essence a line of credit that the customer gets for the benefit of the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.222" offset="3260420">So, again, the crucial question here is whether the customer of the bank has deposited anything within the bank, whether the bank is holding something that is put at risk in the event the bank becomes insolvent, and that is lost when the bank actually fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.362" offset="3320919">The statutory language is somewhat convoluted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.688" offset="3342235">There certainly is no doubt that when Congress created the program against the background of the bank failures during the Depression and against the runs on banks and ultimately against the National Bank Holiday in 1933, Congress had absolutely no doubt about what it was trying to accomplish.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.307" offset="3768762">And that is why it listed checks and drafts, which create unconditional liability which are as good as cash to the depositor, an promissory notes were put in for the same purpose, because the depositor who gives an uncontingent promissory note to the bank may as well have given the bank cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.686" offset="3830307">And in fact, as we explain in our brief, in the 1930's, at the time when this original definition was first written, it was understood that for a variety of purposes the term promissory note should not be deemed to include contingent notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.346" offset="4780851">That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, and again, I can provide an example which I think may make our position clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.198" offset="4808331">Even... I suppose I should break this into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.993" offset="4827453">The first is that if the letter of credit was drawn upon and there was no funding, there was no backing at all, no reimbursement agreement, no note, no anything, Orion, the maker... well, Orion, the customer who obtained the letter of credit, would still be obligated as a matter of commercial law under the UCC to reimburse the bank for whatever the bank paid out on the letter of credit under Article 5, Section 114.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.849" offset="4926927">The fact that that obligation is firmed up by a written reimbursement agreement or by a contingent note doesn't change the nature of the transaction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.255" offset="4972485">The fact remains nothing was put in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.088" offset="4979904">There were no funds given to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.949" offset="4987322">The bank never held anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.741" offset="4994428">And in fact, given the way the transaction here was structured, it was impossible ever for the bank to have held onto its customers' money for any period of time, because the bank could only draw on the note after it had already paid an equivalent amount of money to respondent, so it would simply have been drawing on the note for reimbursement for its own funds which it had spent to cover the letter of credit giving it to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.575" offset="5085856">It seems clear that that could not be the purpose of the federal deposit insurance program, because there was no deposit, there was no money given to the bank, there was no asset at risk in the event that the bank failed, and nothing was lost by the bank's customer when the bank failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.154" offset="5144162">As I suggested before, the FDIC has consistently taken this position since the very language that the Court is focusing on was put in the regulatory definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.620" offset="5846020">First, it would not reduce... it would not remove all letters of credit from protection of deposit insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.224" offset="5864410">It would only remove unfunded letters of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.605" offset="5873918">It would preserve something very much like the current Section 1813(L)(3), which specifically provides for funded letters of credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.363" offset="6160952">To the extent that the funds don't cover the face amount of the letter of credit, the letter would be insured to whatever extent funds were in the bank backing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.797" offset="6366692">You asked, I believe, Justice O'Connor, whether the statutory words, the person obtaining any such credit or instrument, refers to the bank's customer or to the beneficiary of the letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.905" offset="6407130">The words refer to the bank's customer, Orion, and the words mean in respondent's view the person at whose request the bank issues the letter of credit to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.121" offset="6451956">And the primary or secondary liability reference, of course, refers to the customer's liability on the promissory note that he has delivered to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.477" offset="6485393">Further, in regard to a question that Justice Blackmun asked about the status of S. 750, which has recently been introduced by Senator Jake Garn at the FDIC's request and is now before the Senate Committee on Housing, Banking, and Urban Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.618" offset="6561984">I believe that the text of that bill removes all letters of credit from the protection of the deposit insurance program, not merely on funded letters of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.874" offset="6595002">I recall reading an official version of the bill, and I also recall that the trade publication that the FDIC cites in its reply brief letter of credit update contains the text of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.930" offset="6635231">If memory serves me correctly, I believe the bill completely removes letters of credit not just unfunded letters of credit, but all letters of credit from the ambit of the protection of the deposit insurance program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.744" offset="6786532">The FDIC has made the statement in its opening brief that it has never assessed letters of credit of the sort that were issued to respondent in this case, nor has it ever paid claims on letters of credit of this sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.117" offset="6979943">It appears that there was some vague and undefined notion within the FDIC that standby letters of credit, for example, may not have been subject to deposit insurance programs while commercial letters of credit may have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.106" offset="7035949">That, at least, is the suggestion made in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.619" offset="7045980">That is a distinction without a difference, however, because it appears from earlier regulations that the FDIC has provided that that is not a basis upon which to distinguish funded from unfunded letters of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.745" offset="7094464">It appears from Assessment Decision Number 109, for example, that virtually all letters of credit are unfunded, commercial and standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.141" offset="7124034">In Assessment Decision Number 109... I am paraphrasing, but I believe my paraphrase is very close to the actual words of the regulation... the FDIC stated that commercial letters of credit normally are not sold for cash, but are issued against an agreement to reimburse the bank for drafts paid on the letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.194" offset="7196237">The FDIC goes on to say in that Assessment Decision Number 109 that if that reimbursement agreement does not constitute a promissory note, then in that event the letter of credit is not accessible as an insured deposit, the inescapable conclusion being only this, what the statute says, that if the agreement is a promissory note, then the letter of credit is insured and is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.919" offset="7299159">I note also, Justice O'Connor, in further response to your question, that the distinction between funded and unfunded letters of credit has been drawn by the FDIC in other contexts where at least prior to this litigation it was considered important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.810" offset="7362793">I refer to the lending limits regulations that were promulgated and also those dealing with financial statement disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.864" offset="7394976">It does not appear interestingly, and in respondent's view very tellingly, however, in the very regulations that the FDIC promulgated entitled Clarification and Definition of Deposit Insurance Coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.474" offset="7445445">This is 12 CFR Part 320.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.469" offset="8081370">The sources cited as support by the FDIC for that statement were a Treasury regulation dealing with the status of notes that are eligible for discount at federal reserve banks and also a tax decision that addressed a promissory note given by a man to his wife and children for no consideration, and the issue in that case was the deductibility of interest on that note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.377" offset="8197040">Those cases hardly stand for the proposition that Orion's note was not a note, and that really is the question the FDIC is trying to raise, when is a note not a note.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.949" offset="8267257">Further in regard to that question the FDIC has stated that it is a matter of federal law in its reply brief, and has cited the Court to, I believe, two federal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.254" offset="9408495">Congress... and that is the failing of the FDIC's conceptual argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.928" offset="9431273">When people who are not familiar with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act think of the term deposit, they think of it in the sense that the FDIC has presented it here today, the garden variety savings account and checking account, the concept of a physical thing or a physical object left in the custody of the bank almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.848" offset="9506924">In actuality, a deposit is nothing more than a liability, an obligation, and Congress decided that certain persons who theretofore, before the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, had not been recognized as depositors in the traditional sense, would now be treated as depositors, it expanded the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.510" offset="9577559">A good example is in Section 1813(L)(4), which gives insured depositor status to many persons who have not entrusted anything of value to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.537" offset="9617683">Example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.419" offset="9621236">A check that the bank writes to pay its water bill or its light bill may be an insured deposit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.593" offset="11297879">It is stated on Page 4, in Footnote Number 3 of its reply brief, that it maintains no records of the amount of standby letters of credit that are backed by promissory notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.980" offset="11339466">This is especially telling, I think, in view of the importance that the statute itself places on promissory notes, and also in view of the importance that the FDIC has placed in its brief on even some promissory notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.048" offset="11395682">So, that again is another indication in respondent's view of the FDIC's failure to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.738" offset="12062431">Their distinction in two other contexts between funded and unfunded letters of credit, lending limits, and financial statement disclosure, while not making the distinction in the context of deposit insurance, suggests that there is no room for that arbitrary unwarranted gloss on the clear statutory language in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.172" offset="12144246">The consistency of the FDIC's position with its earlier and later pronouncements on the issue must, of course, also be examined as the Court determines the amount of deference to which the FDIC's interpretation is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.985" offset="12227420">In this regard, it is perhaps true that Assessment Decision Number 109 promulgated by the FDIC in 1956 has an importance that cannot be overemphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.141" offset="12268067">That assessment decision states plainly, and it is set out in our brief, that if... that commercial letters of credit, letters of credit used in commerce, normally are not sold for cash, but are issued against an agreement to reimburse the bank for drafts paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.302" offset="12332746">The FDIC goes on to say therein that if the reimbursement agreement is not a promissory note, then in that event the letter of credit is not assessable, the clear unescapable implication being that if the reimbursement agreement is a promissory note as Orion gave Penn Square Bank in this case, the letter of credit is insured and is assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.117" offset="12427936">I was struck listening to... reading the FDIC's briefs and listening to the FDIC's arguments this morning by the similarity between the FDIC's arguments in this case and the arguments that the Federal Reserve Board presented in the Dimension Financial Corporation case which the Court decided just this past January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.159" offset="12504109">As the Court will recall, the issue faced by the Court in that case was whether the Federal Reserve Board in its attempts to expand its regulatory authority over non-bank banks could put an unwarranted gloss on the statutory term demand deposits in the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.690" offset="12574222">Where the Court rejected this attempt by the Federal Reserve Board to usurp the authority of Congress so should it reject the FDIC's similar attempt in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.040" offset="12619675">Respondent's position begins and ends where the statute begins and ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.223" offset="12640364">Where the statute says letter of credit, the FDIC says funded letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.515" offset="12661575">Where the statute says promissory note, the FDIC says uncontingent promissory note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.539" offset="12685713">Or note that in a meaningful economic sense is the equivalent of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.301" offset="12704730">The unadorned language of the statute is free of the equivocations that have been proffered by the FDIC throughout the history of this case in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.299" offset="12744749">The respondent submits that the decision of the Court of Appeals, firmly rooted, as it was, in the plain statutory language, was correct and should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.213" offset="12776410">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.658" offset="12794173">A couple of points, Your Honor, which I will try to make quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.732" offset="12810473">First, as to the crucial question, the meaning of a promissory note in a case, that clearly must be defined by reference to federal law, and it must be determined in light of the meaning of the statute and the Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.460" offset="12865331">It can't be enough if something is a promissory note that it has the term promissory note written across the top.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.454" offset="12885288">Is the note that we are talking about, is that the note that appears at Page 27 of the joint appendix?</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.519" offset="12917575">That is correct, Your Honor, which... and the note is characterized explicitly as a backup note to the letter of credit, which clearly indicates that it is to be drawn upon only when the letter of credit is itself drawn upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.438" offset="12965223">It is impossible to imagine why Congress would have wanted to insure a letter of credit that is backed by this sort of contingent--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3213.082" offset="12999809">On that point, what is your response to his argument that there are a lot of things that the term deposit includes that are not what an old-fashion note of deposit is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.981" offset="13043486">In other words, checks written in payment of services, utility bills, and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.222" offset="13060413">He refers to them on Page 15 of his brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3230.446" offset="13069295">--Well, I should make two points in response to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.407" offset="13081102">First, so far as 1813(L)(1) itself is concerned, which is the part of the statute that is at issue here, everything is defined in terms of money or its equivalent, and it is very difficult to imagine why Congress would have wanted to list something like an incontingent note to say that it must be regarded as money or its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.828" offset="13150797">As to the instruments that the respondent has listed, those all appear in Section 1813(L)(4) of the statute, which is the only part of the deposit definition that is not put in terms of money or its equivalent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3261.946" stopTime="3279.436">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3261.946" offset="13195309">But they all suggest that the purpose of this statute was to extend credit to a number of bank creditors for whom no deposit in the old-fashioned sense had been made, that he fits into that general class, and therefore fits into the overall Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.706" offset="13258317">That is as I understand his argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3279.436" stopTime="3317.162">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3279.436" offset="13265213">Again, I think there are several points to make in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.748" offset="13278483">First, the types of instruments listed in Section 1813(L)(4) are all things for which the bank generally has received cash, such as a cashier's check, or has received services, has received some value for someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.767" offset="13326548">And again, Congress singled out those types of bank instruments such as cashier's checks as the only things which were not defined in terms of money or its equivalent received or held by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.655" offset="13378166">So those, I think, to the extent that they they don't fall into the category of claims that the FDIC is talking about are in a special separate category, and Congress recognized that.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3317.162" stopTime="3329.311">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3317.162" offset="13416201">Well, and do you say an unconditional note would qualify for insurance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3329.311" stopTime="3359.199">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3329.311" offset="13464788">That is correct, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.482" offset="13473461">An unconditional loan is money or its equivalent in a meaningful sense to the depositor of the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.366" offset="13496971">It appears that the respondent's explanation as to why this note should be treated as money or its equivalent is that it gives the bank additional rights to reimbursement it was forced to pay out on the letter of credit, but the crucial point there is that he is talking about reimbursement of the bank's own funds that the bank has paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.586" offset="13565830">It is not customer's funds that the customer has given to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.488" offset="13577428">Those funds don't have to appear in the form--</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.199" offset="13584325">Let's assume that the bank hadn't failed, but there was some payment on the letter of credit by the bank, and then they call on the customer to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.048" offset="13643675">And they sue... and he doesn't pay and they sue on the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.552" offset="13661752">They do collect interest just by the terms of the note.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.678" offset="13706264">But in any event that is really simply like a reimbursement agreement that provided for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.523" offset="13725595">Whether or not it is a note is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.253" offset="13732491">In fact, the logic of respondent's argument reduces the note to irrelevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.216" offset="13748374">It is simply the fact that the lawyers for the parties to this transaction happen to make use of something in the form of a note and wrote Promissory Note across the top.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.273" offset="13784632">Supposing there had been a default, and they paid out half of the amount covered, say $75,000 on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.136" offset="13808037">Then wouldn't the obligation on the note have become a real obligation under your theory, and then it wouldn't have been an insured deposit?</text>
