            <text syncTime="9.778" offset="185552">Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dave Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="13.058" offset="198613">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.744" offset="209376">This case is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.415" offset="228080">During a 1980 prison riot in Oregon, officials formed a plan to restore order and to rescue a hostage whose life had been threatened by a knife-wielding inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.972" offset="270293">An unarmed prison official vaulted over an inmate-constructed barricade and raced up a flight of stairs to the cell in which the hostage was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.312" offset="307701">An inmate, Respondent Albers here, ran up after him.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.811" offset="325673">Pursuant to prior orders, and armed official shot, but shot low, in order to present Respondent and a fellow inmate from getting up the stairs and thereby potentially impeding the rescue attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.183" offset="371126">In this incident, which the record shows took place from start to finish in less time than I have now taken to describe it, the hostage was successfully rescued, but Respondent Albers suffered a serious and permanent injury to his knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.988" offset="426401">The district court below concluded that the evidence presented no basis from which a jury could conclude that the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.235" offset="467361">Respondent and the Ninth Circuit have disagreed, so that this case places squarely the issue as to in the aftermath of this difficult decision, how far the hindsight of a jury can intrude into prison security decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.119" offset="522845">Is it the role of the jury to sort through the waste pile of discarded or unconsidered hostage rescue plans, decide that one of them might have been better, and on that basis assess personal monetary liability against prison officials for a constitutional violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.332" offset="583763">We submit that the Ninth Circuit has permitted a jury to do what this Court repeatedly has told judges themselves to refrain from doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.484" offset="620334">And this case is of extraordinary practical importance because when they are faced with an out break of violence, prison officials must act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.388" offset="651995">They do not have the luxury of after-the-fact reflection.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.198" offset="667250">The maintenance of security, as this Court has repeatedly indicated, is the most essential aspect of the maintaining of prison itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.274" offset="695567">And if officials do not retain control or regain it, the lives of staff and inmates alike are continually at risk, and the officials have abdicated their essential official responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.738" offset="741333">I will argue this morning for the validity of four proposition which should control the outcome of this case: first, that the record shows no proof of wantonness or cruelty in this hostage rescue action, which is essential to establish an Eighth Amendment violation; secondly, that there was no proof that Albers' injury was inflicted unnecessarily, that is to say, totally without penological justification; third, that the Ninth Circuit's reasonableness standard ignores the deference and discretion, the latitude for official judgment which this Court in numerous constitutional cases has repeatedly said is essential for the administration of prisons; and finally, that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit incorrectly interpreted this Court's standards of qualified immunity and it also ignored the total absence of meaningful case law as guidance for prison officials when it denied the existence of immunity for the prison officials in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.386" offset="964001">Let me now recapitulate the facts in more detail because they demonstrate the justice of our cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.478" offset="988347">On June 27th in 1980 the inmates in Cellblock A of the Oregon State Prison became upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.727" offset="1013320">They suspected that other inmates had been mistreated.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.773" offset="1025546">They disobeyed a cell-in order given by prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.833" offset="1041742">One of the two guards on the block was taken hostage; the other was assaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.129" offset="1058982">There was fighting among the inmates, destruction of the furniture in the cellblock was virtually complete, and despite a demonstration to a selected group of the inmates that others in fact had not been abused, the inmates still retained control.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.856" offset="1109869">Richard Klenk was a main instigator of the riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.934" offset="1126169">He was armed with a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.979" offset="1130349">He reported that he had already killed one inmate and would kill others, and he made it clear that if there were any attempt to retain control... regain control of the cellblock, that he would cut the throat of the hostage guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.521" offset="1180504">The plan that was adopted called for Captain Whitley to enter unarmed at a time when Klenk was away from the hostage cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.065" offset="1214672">Surprise about the timing and nature of the assault obviously was a key element.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.830" offset="1229719">Whitley's objective was to secure the safety and return of the hostage officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.671" offset="1249154">Approximately 20 guards were lined up to follow Whitley into the cellblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.544" offset="1264618">The first three of them were armed with shotguns in order to protect Whitley, and the armed guards had been ordered to shoot, but shoot low, any inmate who went up the stairs after Whitley.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.900" offset="1310071">When Klenk again refused to free the hostage, Whitley began the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.366" offset="1327835">Whitley vaulted the barricade as a warning shot was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.819" offset="1341732">He pursued Klenk, who ran up the stairs toward the hostage.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.504" offset="1356465">Officer Kennicott followed over the barricade, firing a second shot in the direction of two inmates who ran up the stairs ahead of Whitley.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.016" offset="1390529">Whitley, in pursuit of Klenk, ran past Albers and started up the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.982" offset="1410382">Albers, who had not run up the stairs after the warning shot or the second shot, then turned, and along with another inmate followed Whitley up the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.245" offset="1443400">Kennicott, pursuant to his orders, shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.009" offset="1454476">Albers was injured in the knee, and the other inmate was also injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.305" offset="1471613">The district court found that on these facts no jury could reasonably find liability under the Eight Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he also found that... directed the verdict on the basis that the defendants in this action were immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.345" offset="1527828">The Ninth Circuit reversed and held that there was a jury question on the existence of an Eighth Amendment violation, and it also held that if an Eighth Amendment violation were found, almost as a per se rule, then a qualified immunity could not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.246" offset="1583417">Before we begin our argument, I think it is appropriate to recapitulate the constitutional tests which we believe that this Court has articulated governing an Eighth Amendment violation in a prison context.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.680" offset="1629183">We are mindful of this Court's admonition that the Eighth Amendment analysis is not simply constituted of parsing dictionary meanings of selected pieces of constitutional--</text>

            <text syncTime="390.859" offset="1709849">We have understood and the District Court understood the due process argument to have been advanced only because the due process clause was the vehicle of incorporating the Eighth Amendment guarantee as against the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.215" offset="1895319">Well, if it is a prison context, then I would suggest that no, that the Eighth Amendment should be the exclusive vehicle by which that is analyzed, or at least if the due process clause is considered the analysis--</text>

            <text syncTime="465.190" offset="2007227">This is more or less a single incident in the process of putting down a prison riot, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="472.106" offset="2034813">--It is a single incident, but the incident implicates the core of what it is that a prison is all about, which is the maintenance of security of people who are very dangerous people.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.259" offset="2075459">And so in that sense, I believe that this Court's analysis in Rhodes v. Chapman would consider it as an Eighth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.116" offset="2102835">Under the due process clause, however, if that were the mode of analysis of this Court, we would conclude that there should be no difference in the analysis, that the tests ultimately would resolve themselves to the same result, and that that would be done by virtue of analyzing whether it was wanton, whether or not it was unnecessary in the sense that it lacked a penological purpose, and whether or not what was done was within the range of professional discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.855" offset="2201892">And each of those things has been examined by this Court in the due process context, we believe in Bell v. Wolfish, Block and Rutherford, but the Eighth Amendment, focusing as it does on punishment and conditions of confinement, is the mode of analysis in which this case was argued at the beginning and which we believe is most appropriate for its disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.778" offset="2349536">I think that the standard that was applied took pieces of what purports to be an Eighth Amendment test, but in the application of that test to what actually happened, as revealed by the record, in fact diluted it and watered it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.069" offset="2406692">What I think the Ninth Circuit did essentially was adopt a reasonableness test, a hindsight reasonableness test.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.100" offset="2566770">It is quite another to apply them incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.990" offset="2574398">And the latter is the flaw of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.785" offset="2585578">And as we understand what it did, it essentially evolves into a reasonableness test because the test of excessiveness as we look at the Ninth Circuit is simply was there some less forceful alternative that might have worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.825" offset="2641689">If that were the case, then a jury question on the reasonableness of the course of action that was chosen is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.073" offset="2666662">We believe that is not what this Court meant by the deliberate indifference test nor by the other tests suggesting that the wanton infliction of pain or unnecessary in the sense that there is no penological objective is the appropriate test.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.723" offset="2901346">But taking all of this Court's recent decisions, we believe that there is a three part test that should govern cases of the kind presented here, whether they are isolated outbreaks of prison violence or whether they go to the question of prison conditions: first of all, that the action that is taken must be wanton in the sense that it is the senseless, irrational infliction of pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.744" offset="2997373">Secondly, it must be unnecessary in the sense that it serves no valid penological purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.726" offset="3021301">And third, it must fall outside the range of acceptable professional discretion which this Court has granted to prison administrators, but which has its limits also.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.363" offset="3059857">Our first proposition obviously is that there is no proof in this record that a jury would have considered that there was wanton infliction of pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.359" offset="3095906">This Court has used adjectives such as gross or extreme or harsh or gratuitous, all of which stem from the historic roots in application of the Eighth Amendment guarantee, even going back to the petition of Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.135" offset="3142927">The Ninth Circuit, we believe, as my colloquy with Justice Powell I hope has demonstrated, that the Ninth Circuit has distorted this to say that if a lesser level of force might have sufficed, then the case must go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.255" offset="3199456">For Albers, on the other hand, apparently any evidence of unreasonableness will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.519" offset="3220458">This is really importing a tort-like cast into the Eighth Amendment's jurisprudence, and whatever else it may do, we believe that the Eighth Amendment does not import the restatement of torts into constitutional litigation, because under either test which has been advanced or mixtures of the test which have been advanced, any evidence of a possibly less forceful alternative would present a jury question, and therefore, virtually any time an inmate is injured by the use of force in the quelling of a prison riot, there would be a jury question under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.974" offset="3350339">This we believe cannot be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.661" offset="3361102">Our second proposition is that Albers' injury was not inflicted unnecessarily, that is to say wholly without penological justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.125" offset="3398927">If there is one central purpose for prisons, it is the maintenance of security, and it takes only the learning of Hudson v. Palmer from which that is virtually a direct quote in order to establish that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.949" offset="3442186">It was objectively clear from the circumstances, however favorably the record is read in favor of Respondent Albers, that any inmate who went up the stairs after an unarmed guard who was attempting to rescue a hostage presented an objective threat to the success of the rescue operation, and if that is the case, then the plan had to account for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.019" offset="3530480">The subjective expectations of Respondent Albers are in that sense constitutionally irrelevant to the fact of the plan that had been formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.530" offset="3560573">And let us bear in mind that if too little force had been used, again with our virtues of hindsight, and if Albers had been of another mindset or if in fact he had ascended the top of the stairs, there might well have been two hostages or two dead hostages or weapons in the control of those who--</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.933" offset="4550195">But at this point obviously he was not doing what he did on the basis of rumor and innuendo and hearsay; he had personally assessed the situation as an expert who had to deal with that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.334" offset="4755727">This was not mindless violence perpetrated against prisoners irrespective of their involvement as aspects who created danger, and even every expert who testified, even those experts who testified on behalf of Respondent, all of them acknowledged that life threatening alternatives might equally have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.293" offset="4839632">One of the alternatives suggested by one of Plaintiff's experts was to assassinate Klenk with a sniper rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.571" offset="4868680">Another expert suggested that riot batons be used, acknowledging in his examination that those riot batons could cause deadly injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.381" offset="4903893">We submit that Albers and the Ninth Circuit have invited juries to substitute their judgment in hindsight on the basis of what might have been most reasonable or more reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.218" offset="4959273">The test is whether the plan that was chosen violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.419" offset="4984142">And on all evidence, even most favorably considered for requirement, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.292" offset="5007547">This Court... and this is our third proposition... has repeatedly declared that broad latitude is necessary for the effective administration of prisons for reasons, policies and the separation of powers, considerations which are too lengthy to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.927" offset="5066166">We note that we are not asking for the promiscuous delegation of discretion to wreak violence on people, but the latitude, the deference that has been acknowledged, whether in Procunier v.

            <text syncTime="1369.932" offset="5626127">Indeed, in this case, Hoyt Cupp was a qualified expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.837" offset="5637725">They would want to know what kind of information they possessed: did they really go out and try to find out what was happening, as Captain Whitley did, actually visit the cell area in order to see, or were they going on rumor and hearsay and other unreliable information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.098" offset="5690806">You'd want to know whether they assessed the risks, did they actually take a look at the alternatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.736" offset="5717346">Did they form a plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.235" offset="5723407">They formed a plan in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.827" offset="5733751">They weighed it against the possibility of tear gas and determined that the threat to the elderly inmates, the fact that they couldn't clear the cellblock in time, the fact that the other cell doors were barricaded, made that not a realistic option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.918" offset="5778055">So you would want in the ideal world a weighing of options by these professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.604" offset="5796863">And finally they formed a plan, and then they followed according to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.307" offset="5811701">The shots that injured Respondent Albers were fired according to a plan that made it absolutely necessary that the entry and escape place, the stairs, was kept safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.802" offset="5849631">Now, once those factors have been considered, that's the realm as we understand it for the operation of the professional judgment that is at issue and that we say is one of the criteria by which you measure whether the Eighth Amendment has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.062" offset="5902711">My fourth and final proposition is that the Ninth Circuit has misconstrued this Court's learning in the application of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.559" offset="5940641">It has reintroduced a subjective test contrary to the learning of this Court in Harlow v.

            <text syncTime="1535.320" offset="6287652">But we further assert that even under the standard, with the... which the state is suggesting, a jury could have round in Albers' favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.629" offset="6332896">Thus, we urge the Court to affirm the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.124" offset="6358914">The state has presented a distorted picture of the events at the Oregon State Penitentiary on June 27, &lt;nineteen eighty&gt; [= 1980], and has also misstated the legal standard announced by the Ninth Circuit and the position that Albers is taking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.369" offset="6419936">With this in mind, I wish to discuss the legal standard which is not a minimal tort standard which Albers proposes, and then we can look at the facts and see whether the record shows, drawing all inferences in Albers' favor, as we must in a directed verdict case, that a court erred in issuing a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.361" offset="6507916">No one disagrees that under the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishments clause a state cannot inflict the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, and in dealing with the due process clause, no one disagrees that force used by the state must be reasonably related to legitimate governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.368" offset="6587851">In fact, the interests involved here in this case concerning the use of deadly force is no more than the... is exactly the same interest that this Court dealt with in the Garner case last year when it talked about the use of deadly force against a fleeing felony suspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.429" offset="7216148">First, I believe that it is crucial to look at the degree of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.879" offset="7241957">We absolutely agree that not every showing of force states a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.206" offset="7271214">As Judge Friendly said in the Johnson v. Glick case which this Court cited with some approval again in the Ingraham case for the proposition that prison brutality is subject to Eighth Amendment analysis, not every push or shove states a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.448" offset="7332236">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.213" offset="7335266">But we need not decide in this case what the exact line is that needs to be gone over because here we are dealing with deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.383" offset="7375913">The state agrees that we are talking about deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.412" offset="7388034">The state's analysis takes into account in no way how much force is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.534" offset="7416560">So as far as the state's analysis is concerned, you just don't need to consider whether deadly force is used or some other force, and we think that this Court's analysis of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment principles says that the state's position is wrong on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.317" offset="7551665">I believe that we can't make a distinction constitutionally when a police officer takes a firearm and shoots, even though they are attempting to shoot low, and we think that a jury should consider that, we are still talking about the most severe force that the government can inflict on a member of society, and we know of various examples where, of course, policemen say they have shot low and they still miss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.665" offset="7661066">The fact is Albers was hit, he bled severely, he climbed up the stairs, he lost six out of the eleven or thirteen pints of blood in the body, he had to take a piece of clothing off of his body to tie a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, which may have very well saved his life.</text>

Wade case, dealing with punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.322" offset="9515760">We're talking about a very high standard on the spectrum, and we're not willing to go to the state standard, which we don't think is supportable, of actually having to show full punitive intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.003" offset="9566437">We think the evidence here can meet that standard, but that's not our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.219" offset="9603322">Now, I'm not sure what the state said other than that if the least penological purpose is served by the most excessive use of force, then that is necessary for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.777" offset="9653477">That's wrong I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.191" offset="9723172">We're not just dealing with a fine balancing test where if we can show that there was a less harsh means for taking care of Albers, we win.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.562" offset="9768625">But we are dealing with the most serious force here, or certainly a very serious force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.748" offset="9789418">So we think that the gross disproportionality standard certainly is a very serious consideration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.135" offset="9822960">Finally, we would like to look at the degree of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.180" offset="9847097">We think that there may be some situations where even though force is applied unnecessarily and wantonly, the pain that it causes is so insignificant that it might not raise the constitutional dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.599" offset="9892863">There is no question in this case that Albers suffered very serious pain, perhaps the most serious you can suffer without actually dying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.564" offset="9920657">Now I would like to apply the facts of this case to these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.608" offset="9952840">We're not relying on an expert battle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.449" offset="9976246">We think that a judge could in fact issue a directed verdict even though one expert says that prison officers inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain on a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.647" offset="10020968">But we want to look at the actual facts, and I stress that what the courts... what the Attorney General said was a good closing argument to a jury, but if you look at this record, he did not draw all inferences in Albers' favor, and of course, if there is any substantial evidence in the record to support Albers' position, a directed verdict was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.465" offset="10128279">The jury should have an opportunity to decide the question if there is any evidence of any sufficiency to meet our standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.709" offset="10185226">The focus was on Richard Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.911" offset="10198078">The security manager had been inside that cellblock three times over the hour and a half period that the disturbance went on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.137" offset="10262966">Inmates were milling around, waiting, according to the testimony, for something to be done about Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.604" offset="10292850">Klenk did have a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.774" offset="10309569">Klenk had said that he had killed an inmate, which was wrong, but we're assuming that Whitley understood that he killed an inmate legitimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.772" offset="10337467">Whitley said that his main concern was Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.738" offset="10365366">The other defendants said that their main concern was Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.563" offset="10380622">And it had to be because no one was supporting Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.594" offset="10400788">Whitley never saw any other inmates around Klenk saying go ahead, you know, let's keep this thing going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.902" offset="10426075">Whitley only was concerned about trying to neutralize Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.948" offset="10442166">A few moments before the shooting began, Gerald Albers was asked by some inmates to come downstairs and to try to help resolve the disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.959" offset="10494306">Albers is a pretty well respected inmate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.065" offset="10510711">That's a stipulated fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.909" offset="10518026">He's also in an honor block.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.578" offset="10536729">We understand they were all maximum security prisoners, but in the context of the prison, these prisoners had a history at least for a period of time of good behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.691" offset="12053190">The inmates basically were standing around, standing outside their cells on different tiers, looking, seeing what was going on down in the open area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.656" offset="12089030">That certainly is a violation of the cell-in order, but the violation was only to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.841" offset="12109823">Now, what happened next is when Mr. Whitley went out, he talked to Cupp and he talked to Kennicott, and a decision was made to shoot anyone going up those stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.321" offset="12159665">The only way Albers had a chance to get back to his cell was going up those stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.506" offset="12176488">So he's waiting for Whitley to come back, expecting Whitley to help get the elderly inmates out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.035" offset="12202610">By the way, under this case, the experts said that it's appropriate professional procedure to allow inmates who don't want to get involved in a disturbance to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.234" offset="12243361">Instead of, however, coming back with a key, Whitley comes back, he says let's go, shoot the bastards, and starts running up the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.385" offset="12291949">Albers hears those words, he sees firearms, he starts hightailing back to his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.446" offset="12312220">He turns around, glances over his shoulder, and he sees a rifle, he freezes... this is the testimony... he looks Kennicott right in the eye, Kennicott admitted he knew Albers, he knew he was well-behaved, and then Albers is shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.721" offset="12369271">There's no basis to believe Albers was dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.455" offset="12384213">And even applying any semblance of the Garner reasoning without expecting even a probable cause standard, can we shoot someone without any basis to believe that they're dangerous, under the circumstances of this case, given the particular exigencies that I have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.635" offset="12456938">I think that's an appropriate question for a jury, and that's really all we need to decide here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.037" offset="12486613">Mr. Cupp said that anyone outside their cell was fair game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.458" offset="12508243">That's an indication, I believe, along with Whitley's statement of shoot the bastards, but even the punitive intent to get Albers, for some reason, was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.953" offset="12546277">So we could meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.391" offset="12555995">But even under our correct analysis, or under our correct analysis of the constitutional standard, the deadly force was inflicted unnecessarily, which means grossly disproportionate to any need, and wantonly reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.431" offset="12608135">They never gave Albers a warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.680" offset="12617121">They never gave him a way out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.758" offset="12621405">Even Garner was told to halt before he was shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.304" offset="12639586">Even the Tennessee statute that you dealt with in that case required a warning of "Halt" before using deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.051" offset="12666649">There were no words spoken to Gerald Albers before he was shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.847" offset="12685771">Potential dangerousness is not sufficient to use deadly force, and that's all the state has said in tis case they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.233" offset="12723387">Maybe a jury would conclude that what they did was constitutionally proper, but under the circumstances and the proper standard to be applied, a jury could also reasonably have concluded that what they did was improper constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.820" offset="12789738">The principle that juries are links to the public attitude of contemporary standards of decency under the Eighth Amendment, are still good law, and juries perform this historical function day in and day out, and they apply the same standards we're suggesting day in and day out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.358" offset="12863822">It's our position that they should be allowed to apply those standards in this case, assuming the judge finds that there is sufficient evidence in the record to raise to the standards that we're discussing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.007" offset="12938427">We believe the law was clear at the time that prison officers could not use grossly disproportionate and excessive force.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.925" offset="12982104">Whether a riot in fact provided them with the circumstances so that they should not he held liable on the merits is one thing, but we cannot have a riot exception carved out of the legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.608" offset="13036857">So the law was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.029" offset="13046574">The Ninth Circuit reasoning I am not supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.841" offset="13061830">We did not argue that reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.823" offset="13065696">We argued simply that under the Harlow standard, the law was clear at the time that you have a principle of what unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain means, by repeated circuit court decisions and the general doctrines of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.629" offset="13124942">One point about the riot in answering Justice Brennan's inquiry about my discussing immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.205" offset="13155244">The state admits that if they dropped napalm on the cellblock, that might be a constitutional violation because it would show imputed intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.811" offset="13193696">But under their immunity argument they would be immune because there was never a court decision that dealt with a riot and told them what they could do or could not do in the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.931" offset="13242179">That stresses and highlights the weakness of the state's position on the kind of identity you need to meet this court's requirement that there be a clear constitutional principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.112" offset="13322845">I believe I will not require all of the time, but I wish to clarify some issues of fact, some of law, and some of concluding policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.655" offset="13349072">The first one of fact is that obviously the crisis was not subsiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.670" offset="13365059">At best the facts show that it was a stalemate, no one had given an inch, there was still a hostage and still a knife-wielding inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.965" offset="13394316">Second, the evidence was that all or almost all of the inmates were out of their cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.229" offset="13419289">The third point, which is much... is one as much of prediction as one of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.696" offset="13437157">It is a point raised by Justice Marshall's colloquy with counsel... is that no one could know what Albers would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.287" offset="13463593">This was a split second decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.833" offset="13473729">Two inmates, one of them Albers, one another, were going up the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.925" offset="13494104">The presumption ought to have been one of dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.565" offset="13504657">The third factual issue is that there was no testimony so far as I am aware that the... all of the other inmates, all 199 of the others were simply waiting for something to be done about Klenk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.029" offset="13554499">Now some points about law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.403" offset="13564008">Tennessee v Gardner is inapt and inappropriate in the resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.730" offset="13585324">Not only does it deal with a different amendment, but there's a very stark fact about the difference between the subject of the shooting in that case and in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.585" offset="13620746">Here Albers objectively was pursuing an unarmed guard who was attempting to rescue a person in a position of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.566" offset="13648644">He wasn't fleeing a crime, he was running to the maximum point of danger in this prison at this time, which was hostage cell No 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.250" offset="13683440">And the notion that he should have been presumed, constitutionally presumed meant that the state officials dealing with this issue should presume constitutionally that he would behave as a law abiding citizen instead of a person incarcerated in a maximum security institution is a presumption that flies against our common sense and our sense of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.570" offset="13760657">The second point on the law that I'd wish to leave with this Court is that there was no deliberate indifference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.426" offset="13792109">The constellation of concerns that prison officials had to be aware of included the possibility that if the disturbance were to continue, the inmates would wreak violence on themselves, on the most vulnerable and weak of those who were there, that the hostage guard might be might be further harmed, that indeed, if the riot or disturbance went on, that very serious damage could occur to people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.058" offset="13886672">Now, to characterize the plan as deliberately indifferent to that whole range of concerns is to misuse the test that this Court has articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.945" offset="13922199">And our point, I believe, is equally well made by the United States government in its amicus curiae brief on pages 21 and 22 on that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.519" offset="13956471">The last point with respect to the law is on the issue of disproportionality as counsel argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.829" offset="13985729">We do not understand the disproportionality analysis in the cruel and unusual punishment cases to have application to what we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.373" offset="14027942">It has been evolved in the case of sentences that has been its sole restriction, with the exception of one minor mention in Rhodes v Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.571" offset="14056677">Finally, let me suggest the reality confronted by prison officials in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.490" offset="14092413">Every day we are bombarded by headlines about hostage taking, about risks, and about alternatives which sometimes end in tragedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.627" offset="14124909">There are in many of these cases no risk-free alternatives, certainly in the context of a prison riot where there is already a hostage and an imminent threat, not merely to the hostage but to other lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.265" offset="14167436">There ought to be some consideration about the fact that there is no perfect answer, and that despite the best of professional intentions, the result may be tragic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.118" offset="14206933">Fortunately that was not the result in this case, where Captain Whitley deserves a badge of heroism and not a civil rights action asking for monetary damages against him.</text>
