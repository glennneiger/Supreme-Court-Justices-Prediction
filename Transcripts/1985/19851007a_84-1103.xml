            <text syncTime="1170.319" offset="4806598">Whatever the Circuit Court Judge would have said at that time would have had no effect on the potential parole eligibility date of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.443" offset="4851111">It was strictly controlled by Act 93 and that would have been set once he reached the Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.113" offset="4877756">I believe that that was probably just a result of having at that time some of the judges continuing to do that, because prior to the enactment of Act 93 if one was under the age of 21 and he would be immediately parole eligible upon being sent to the Arkansas Department of Corrections as a first offender, and the judge could make him serve one-third less good time by saying he had to serve a third.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.918" offset="7125018">The simple issue, I submit to the Court in this case, is whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the Petitioner was not constitutionally entitled to an evidentiary hearing in a collateral attack of his voluntary guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.943" offset="7169113">I submit to you, the Court of Appeals did not make error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.062" offset="7181547">This Court on several occasions has emphasized the validity and importance of plea bargaining process, and likewise stated, for the plea bargaining process to work, a guilty plea must be accorded a great measure of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.488" offset="7239225">In this instance, the truthfulness and the accuracy of this guilty plea, this voluntary guilty plea, is evidenced by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.226" offset="7266184">I submit that generally speaking, parole eligibility is not a direct but rather a collateral consequence of any guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.914" offset="7296904">It is unnecessary to advise the defendant who desires to plead guilty as to parole eligibility, and the fact that the defendant is misadvised does not in itself per se negate that voluntary plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.239" offset="7346223">In fact, we have found in the Federal Criminal Rules of Procedure, Rule 11, that the... we have stated in the comments that not only is the question as advise as to when someone might make parole or be parole eligible, but whether, and that is true in Arkansas as there is no requirement to advise as to parole eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.934" offset="7421038">In the case at bar the record clearly demonstrates, I submit to this Court, that parole eligibility was not a part of the plea bargain, and that this Petitioner was not wrongfully induced to plead guilty based on some assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.293" offset="7478507">I would further submit to this Court that a better rule of law is that even if the defendant was ill-advised or misinformed as to what the precise eligibility is to be for parole, that fact alone does not take away from guilt or the desire to enter a plea of guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.874" offset="7784767">This allegation has become a very common vehicle for those incarcerated to seek relief by simply placing the system and their attorney on trial by realizing their petition as petitioner, at worst cases merely the status quo,</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.800" offset="7840460">"I voluntarily entered my plea of guilty, I made an informed decision to waive my rights and was sentenced, but maybe I can receive a more favorable sentence later if I will file this collateral attack on that sentence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.358" offset="7890719">In particular, I submit to you today, what troubles me about this case is that the so-called inducement to plea asserted by Petitioner is actually only that individual's unilateral expectation, an expectation which rarely, as in this case, if ever can be tested by any objective standard, and which submits virtually every guilty plea, and in Arkansas there are some 10,000 entered each year, to attack collaterally at any time when the defendant upon incarceration determines that his expectations, whatever they may have been, that being denied a right to vote would not have occurred, or being denied the right to hold a hunting licence or a barber's licence would not have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.785" offset="8056440">If he asserts, then, that because of his expectation he can challenge, collaterally challenge the voluntariness of that plea and be entitled to an evidentiary hearing because of his own individual expectations, and this instance has been stated before clearly, a competent and dedicated and respected public defender, now deceased, cannot be heard as to what in fact did go on in terms of contradicting or supporting the Petitioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.233" offset="8154242">But in this instance we have a record that demonstrates that that competent and dedicated public defender, who in my opinion did know the law, saw from the defendant an assertion that there were zero prior convictions.</text>
