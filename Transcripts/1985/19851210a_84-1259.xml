            <text syncTime="36.006" offset="291841">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="303648">This is a Fourth Amendment administrative search case where Dow is asking this Court to reinstate the district court's holding that EPA's action both exceeded its statutory authority under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act, and that EPA's actions amounted to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="398107">On cross-motion for summary judgment, and as the tryer of fact, the district court found that the Dow facility in Midland, Michigan was a highly secured commercial facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.012" offset="443874">It was not an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.131" offset="452337">The district court also found that EPA's action amounted to a search, a fact which the Government admitted, both in its brief and its oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="495596">The district court also found that the EPA's photographs contained vivid detail to the point of depicting items and equipment as small as one-half inch in diameter, and the court found that the camera saw much more than the human aerial eye or mind could ever see.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.816" offset="567067">In September of 1977, EPA conducted a three-hour on-site inspection of the two powerhouses at Dow's Midland facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.374" offset="613252">That was done in continuing preparation for Clean Air Act enforcement action and to confirm the EPA's suspicion that the two powerhouses did in fact violate the Clean Air Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.101" offset="680230">Yes, it was, Justice Brennan, and during that inspection the EPA people received full cooperation from Dow personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.324" offset="709069">They saw everything they wanted to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.157" offset="716383">They were denied nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.841" offset="723175">In fact, after the inspection, at EPA's request Dow submitted drawings and schematics to EPA depicting the powerhouses, the equipment in the powerhouses, and the areas surrounding the powerhouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.135" offset="784301">The EPA enforcement engineer testified that after that September inspection he needed no further information from or about Dow to confirm his suspicions that the powerhouses were in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.997" offset="851802">Three months later, in early December of 1977, Dow received a phone call from the EPA requesting a repetitive on-site inspection with a camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.637" offset="902375">Dow refused that request, told the EPA it would not allow non-Dow cameras inside the fence line, and the possibility of EPA's getting a warrant was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.980" offset="955769">In fact, after the phone call a Dow attorney called the U.S. attorney's office in Bay City, Michigan and told that office that if the EPA approached the office and was going to try to seek a warrant, that Dow would appreciate the opportunity to be there and be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.942" offset="1027554">Two months after that refusal of the second on-site inspection, knowing that Dow refused consent for a second on-site inspection, knowing that Dow objected to aerial photographs, or the photographs of its plant, and knowing of its duty to resort to the court, the EPA ignored Dow's constitutional and statutory rights and ignored its duty to seek judicial oversight and acquired surreptitiously--</text>

            <text syncTime="259.834" offset="1187110">The EPA had tried to come on to that property to conduct a search and had been turned away after there had been one consensual, voluntary inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.993" offset="1239772">The district court found that there was a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.362" offset="1249281">In fact, the Government admitted in both the oral argument and the brief that it had conducted a search in conducting the fly-over.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.182" offset="1276553">The district court also found that EPA's actions exceeded its statutory inspection authority under Section 114.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.372" offset="1309258">On appeal by the Government the Sixth Circuit... the Sixth Circuit agreed with the district court that Section 114 of the Clean Air Act does not explicitly authorize aerial photography as a site inspection technique, but the district court, ignoring the plain language of the statute, ignoring the obvious congressional intent of providing the owners notice, without citation to any authority, held that the Act did not impliedly forbid aerial photography.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.394" offset="1653343">Under the statute the taking of pictures, the capturing of the extreme intrusive detail to the size of a half-inch in diameter, deprives Dow of the notice that an inspection has occurred and deprives Dow of the opportunity to claim confidential business information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.296" offset="6940945">Referring to the issue that came up several times in petitioner's argument as to whether EPA conducted a search here, obviously the ultimate issue in this case is whether there was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.555" offset="6997996">But, she has suggested that we conceded in the court of appeals that there was a search here, and of course that's true, there was a search in the layman's normal use of the term, that is, EPA was looking for something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.463" offset="7045643">That is what law enforcement agencies do all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.065" offset="7056092">They can look at cars on the street to see if one matches a description of the car that fled a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.636" offset="7086394">That's a search, of course, but it is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.207" offset="7100605">A search that is regulated by the Fourth Amendment is one that invades a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that's what the ultimate issue in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.360" offset="7129235">It is our position that the overflight here and the photography did not invade any reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.014" offset="7155880">Maybe the best way to frame the issue is to look at the way that Dow has chosen to define its facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.553" offset="7190048">They have taken issue with the government's characterization or it as an outdoor plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.107" offset="7208230">On page 4 of their reply brief they define it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.576" offset="7222127">The plant here is a three-dimensional commercial structure which encompasses production equipment and know-how and which does not have a traditional roof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.319" offset="7277088">My understanding is that Dow is not arguing that the Constitution necessarily would forbid an overflight just to take a picture of a beautiful plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.229" offset="7444690">I should have at the outset mentioned... I had understood, certainly when I did the brief in this case, that the whole crux of their claim was that there were trade secrets in the plant, and we devoted quite a bit of attention to that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.286" offset="7492964">In the reply brief Dow says that our discussion of trade secrets misses the point, that it is the intrusive surveillance of detail beyond the purview of the naked eye that constitutes the Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.261" offset="7536850">The Fourth Amendment violation exists independently of the capturing of any Dow trade secrets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.434" offset="7581572">--Well, let me assume that there are some sort of, at least proprietary information there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.454" offset="7601634">First of all, I think we would say that it's in fact not a secret, and the fact is that it's exposed to the view of anyone who can fly over, and there is... I don't know there is any real law on the question of whether it's a trade secret under statutes, but I think it probably would be found not to be a trade secret under the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.899" offset="7667358">In any case, assuming it is found to be a trade secret, even though it is open to the public, the fact is that EPA has not taken any trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.053" offset="7700063">The trade secret that they are discussing in here is something that is revealed through this extreme magnification of these photographs that Dow themselves did and that are shown to you in the sealed Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.861" offset="7743217">EPA didn't blow up these photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.729" offset="7750741">They weren't even looking at the chemical plant that is the focus of this trade secret claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.948" offset="7767563">They were looking at the power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.633" offset="7774355">The chemical plant happened to be next door and it was captured in the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.251" offset="7788775">But, a trade secret has been revealed to the government in this case only in the sense that there is some potentiality for the government to actually discover it by using examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.761" offset="7842796">That's a little bit like the issue in Knotts or in Karo where the Court found that the mere installation of a beeper was not a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.498" offset="7869754">It wasn't until you actually monitored it that you had transformed the potential to conduct some sort of a search into actually doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.938" offset="7903505">Third, I would say that all of the trade secret legislation which is basically directed at unfair competition, not at the things that the Fourth Amendment is aimed at, all of that is directed at the unfair use of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.780" offset="7962959">If EPA was planning to build a chemical plant and copy these type configurations that we are assuming were secrets, then there might be some basis for a trade secret claim here, but there is no suggestion that EPA is going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.338" offset="8013114">They are using these pictures for the purpose of enhancing their investigation of Clean Air Act violations, and the fact that there's a trade secret there is basically, completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.361" offset="8053238">It's the same as if somebody would throw a... some sort of invention that he would call a trade secret in the middle of his marijuana field and then claims that the government can't fly over his field and take a picture of it because they're capturing a trade secret on the picture.</text>

I know it's not true in this case, but what if there were a secret that the government was interested in acquiring, went over and took a picture and then went ahead and developed its own plant to make whatever the chemical might be or something.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.832" offset="8179149">Well, I think the claim is probably... I'm not sure I would agree with it, but I think it's probably more of a taking claim than anything else, and there was a Fifth Amendment claim in this case that was dismissed without prejudice that they can bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.258" offset="8232856">If the government actually was going to use this information, the court, I guess, was considering that sort of an issue in Monsanto last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.912" offset="8259501">But there is no suggestion of that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.612" offset="8266293">I would say again, though, I doubt that it is a trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.149" offset="8280399">Now it's a question of tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.332" offset="8289176">I think also, more generally, the reason why this might arguably be a trade secret has nothing at all to do with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.855" offset="8319270">I mean, there is a sense that corporations are entitled to maintain the fruits of their research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.592" offset="8354169">They spend a lot of money developing these sources of secrets, and it is unfair competition in a sense for... or maybe unfair competition for a competitor to just take the fruits of their labor and then use it without infusing the same amount of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.970" offset="8419684">Now, that principle is limited by what the competitor or the... excuse me, the inventor of the trade secret is required to disclose to the public, because it is a clear, recognized principle of trade secret law that if you've developed something and put it into a product and it's a secret at that time, that if a competitor can figure out through what is called reverse engineering, by dissecting a product that is found on the market, figuring out how it was made and basically acquire all the information that you've developed through your research, that is not a violation of trade secret statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.707" offset="8554581">So, again, I am not sure there is really a secret here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.493" offset="8565761">But the reasons for having these kinds of unfair competition statutes don't have to do with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.213" offset="8592615">It's easy to see that conduct that might be considered unfair competition under the trade secret laws would clearly not be considered a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.986" offset="8627723">One example is the use of an informant, which government law enforcement agencies do all the time, and that's not considered to violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.092" offset="8660220">On the other hand, most trade secret statutes suggest that if you have a spy in another plant or can somehow convince an employee of another plant to exchange loyalties and give you trade secrets, that is considered unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.332" offset="8709121">I think another example is the Christopher case that was cited, the Fifth Circuit case that was cited by Dow Chemical in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.672" offset="8738483">That's a case where one company was building a plant and a competitor flew over and took aerial photographs of it before the plant was completed, before they had a chance to put the roof on, basically, although they were putting a roof on it, kind of snuck in there, and the Fifth Circuit said that was dirty pool in the trade secret context and they considered it unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.800" offset="8819044">Even in that context, I can't believe if the state had sent a plane over to check for building code violations, if that was threatening the safety of the employees who were going to be working in that plant, that that would be considered to violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.345" offset="8881216">They're looking for other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.297" offset="8893023">Finally, I would make one more point about the trade secret claim, and that is that it doesn't really address what the issue here is because what they're claiming, I take it, is that the EPA overflight and photography was some kind of a search that required EPA to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.425" offset="8965539">They are not suggesting that the government, under no circumstances, could have conducted this overflight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.727" offset="8982675">But, if we did get a warrant to look for these emissions, we would have exactly the same pictures of Dow's plant and we would have exactly the same trade secrets, and they would have exactly the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.899" offset="9019351">The relief that they are seeking here, forcing EPA to get a warrant, doesn't at all address this sort of complaint that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.855" offset="9055191">So, that's sort of a long answer, Justice Powell, but I think really, trade secrets have very little to do with this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.074" offset="9800099">Here we had a footnote in our brief, discussing whether this qualifies as privilege or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.954" offset="9983583">I mean, what Dow has done here is, they have built a facility and they have put a fence around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.572" offset="10002078">We don't dispute that, and it's very hard to get in on the ground, and they haven't built a roof, and they want the Fourth Amendment to build a roof for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2473.128" offset="10040321">They want one that lets in the rain, lets in the snow, lets in news photographers, apparently lets in people who are just flying over and looking down, maybe lets in people who are taking pictures from higher altitudes, but it doesn't let EPA take photographs that are relevant to its enforcement of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.074" offset="10108135">And, there's no reason why the Fourth Amendment should do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.711" offset="11582695">But I'm a little bit unwilling to concede that they're really interested in protecting trade secrets because I think you have to look at the course of the litigation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.567" offset="11618117">I mean, they found out that EPA had taken these pictures and they ran into court, they got an injunction from the district court that prevents any use of the pictures and any future overflights, I think surveillance or photography by EPA, but I guess they really conceded away in this Court part of what they won in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.064" offset="11704007">If they were worried about trade secrets, all they had to do was talk to the EPA and say, look, we're really worried about these trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.753" offset="11730861">Here, you use these pictures for your enforcement action but we want you to keep them under seal and we only want you to give them back to us when you're done with the enforcement action and don't blow them up because that's going to reveal trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.125" offset="11776314">After all, there's no trade secrets, as I said before, on anything that EPA has, other than just potential to blow them up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.473" offset="12169718">That's two on the ground, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be equally true from the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.793" offset="12190930">The point is whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy that is being infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.431" offset="12213500">If the government uses some sort of space age technology that's only available to the Pentagon or the military, then a person on the ground probably has a right to assume that he's going to be free from that kind of surveillance, and surveillance of that type probably does violate a reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.475" offset="12281732">If EPA is going nothing more than taking the same photographs that everyone else is taking, and here again I'll repeat that all they did was hire this local concern and told them to take a picture with their equipment, and the idea that we used sophisticated equipment... it's certainly more sophisticated than a Kodak Instamatic but it was basically just regular old aerial photography cameras.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.485" offset="12761758">So, the Fourth Amendment does go beyond what people have... it does give an additional protection beyond what the government is willing to confer.</text>
