            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="207685">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.512" offset="218970">Today this Court is faced with the question of the extent of a police officer's civil liability for damages resulting from an arrest made pursuant to a warrant which the police officer sought and obtained from a natural and detached magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.587" offset="283335">Specifically, can a police officer who applied for and obtained an arrest warrant face civil liability for damages on the theory that he should have known that the facts recited in the affidavit submitted to the magistrate were insufficient to establish probable cause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="51.866" stopTime="59.805">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="51.866" offset="352403">Ms. Sheadel, may I interrupt you just for a moment to announce that Justice Prennan will be delayed in arriving, but will participate in all the cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ann_m_sheadel" startTime="59.805" stopTime="181.668">
            <label>Ms. Ann M. Sheadel</label>
            <text syncTime="59.805" offset="384168">We ask this Court to find that a police officer cannot be amenable to suit in such a situation, but rather that he is in fact immune, from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.394" offset="422516">In this context, the police officer's actions should be protected from suit for the same reasons, the same policy concerns, that have teen enunciated by this Court in its decisions regarding immunity and where to draw the line between immune actions and non-immune actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.856" offset="492315">In deciding where to draw such a line, the Court has recognized that the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative, recognizing that in any balance drawn not all interests can be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.966" offset="552815">In such a balance, the Court has recognized that on the one hand it is trying to vindicate constitutional rights, while on the other hand it is trying to protect officials who are required to exercise discretion in fulfilling their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.291" offset="610075">In determining the extent of any such immunity, the Court has considered two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.529" offset="635048">The first factor considered by the Court has been the function performed by the official in question and the historical extent of the immunity that's been granted to that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.568" offset="671202">The second consideration has been the policies that exist in applying that immunity to the action at question.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.491" offset="702862">In applying this standard to this case, the function that we're examining is the function of police officer in applying to a magistrate for an arrest warrant, and the question then becomes should this function receive a full exemption from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.950" offset="764720">We believe that this function should receive a full exemption from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.820" offset="784260">Our primary argument about the functional analysis of the police officer applying to a magistrate for an arrest warrant is that the function that the police officer is performing is very similar to the function of a prosecuting attorney in placing information before a grand jury and asking the grand jury to find that probable cause exists and to indict.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.668" offset="871613">Ms. Sheadel, do you concede that the facts that were available here were not sufficient to justify the issuance of a warrant?</text>

            <text syncTime="196.677" offset="931695">But we do not believe that whether or not this Court believes that probable cause existed would be determinative in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.581" offset="959280">Well, if you would assume for a, moment that the facts were insufficient to amount to probable cause and if the warrant had issued and evidence obtained as a result of it, would the evidence be excludable in your view under the Leon case at trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="225.612" offset="1047365">Using the Leon case, it's possible the evidence could be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.231" offset="1061889">Again, the Leon factors are such that it would require a very specific analysis of the situation in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="237.587" offset="1095326">Why should a different rule apply than in insulating the officer from any damage liability than the rule that would be applied for exclusion of evidence under Leon?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.247" offset="1153944">Why shouldn't these two track each other?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ann_m_sheadel" startTime="255.032" stopTime="289.619">
            <label>Ms. Ann M. Sheadel</label>
            <text syncTime="255.032" offset="1165020">We don't believe that this Court has ever said that the two rules are synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.167" offset="1181634">In fact, in its analysis it appears that the Court has considered some different factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.138" offset="1201487">If in fact the rules were going to be synonymous, it would appear to us that it would question a magistrate's immunity from civil liability because the magistrate is involved in the decision to issue the search warrant or the arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.128" offset="1253419">And if we were tracking the exclusionary rule, it would seem that, since the magistrate made a decision that shouldn't have been made, then it would require some kind of analysis of the magisterial exemption from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.136" offset="1301484">We believe that--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="289.619" offset="1303365">But in Leon was there not some indication that perhaps deterrence is a valid objective if the police officer's reliance on the warrant is objectively unreasonable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ann_m_sheadel" startTime="302.929" stopTime="351.159">
            <label>Ms. Ann M. Sheadel</label>
            <text syncTime="302.929" offset="1356655">--Yes, I believe that was indicated in Leon.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.065" offset="1369193">In the civil liability aspect, the Court has looked at the question of deterrence of one of the factors considered in whether or not immunity should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.587" offset="1407332">Instead of using the word</text>
            <text syncTime="316.887" offset="1412452">"deterrence, I think more often the Court will look at if there are adequate safeguards other than civil liability or if there are things the Court might call alternative remedies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="326.294" offset="1450069">"That has been a policy consideration of the Court in its civil liability analysis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="333.281" offset="1478072">What the Court has looked at whenever it has granted immunity to an official within the judicial process in deciding whether or not there are these alternatives available, the Court has considered such things as being within the judicial process and the checks and balances that are inherent in that process.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.098" offset="1581308">I mean, Leon would be irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.795" offset="2020165">We feel very strongly that the function performed by the police officer in this occasion was the function performed by the prosecuting attorney in asking the grand jury to indict.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.310" offset="2218173">The first way is by putting that actual determination of probable cause into the judicial proceeding, asking a neutral and detached body in the judicial process to make that decision, the magistrate of course being the neutral and detached body that the police officer is seeking review from and the grand jury being the neutral and detached body that the prosecuting attorney is seeking review from.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.526" offset="2315035">The second way that it's brought into the criminal proceedings is that if the grand jury decides to indict and if the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, criminal prosecution has begun and criminal proceedings have begun, with all of the checks and balances, all of the protections inherent in those criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.987" offset="2392880">Therefore, we believe that this function of the police officer and the function of the prosecuting attorney are so similar that the immunity granted to a prosecuting attorney for the function that he performs should also be applied to the police officer in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.716" offset="2463829">We believe that the Court's policy reasons for applying immunity also apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.386" offset="2498519">In deciding whether or not to apply immunity, the Court has considered several policy factors, and we believe those policy factors can be summarized in three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.896" offset="2552540">One area, the first area, is whether or not the action occurred within judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.235" offset="2581902">The second is whether or not the action taken is likely to result in retaliatory lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.503" offset="2602904">And the third is whether or not there are sufficient safeguards to establish the accountability of the official.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.043" offset="2629131">The Court's policy concerns first center around whether or not the action occurs within the judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.963" offset="2660792">In every case when the Court has granted any kind of absolute immunity, it has always been within the judicial process, except of course for that instance in which the President of the United States was granted immunity because of his very special and unique function in our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.489" offset="2718888">But in every other case, absolute immunity has been granted because of an action that has occurred within the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.476" offset="2746891">The Court has stated that it is very concerned to make sure that the integrity of the judicial process is insulated from lawsuit, that the actors in the judicial process should be free to act on their own convictions without fear of damages liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.505" offset="2814914">The Court has encouraged and has stated the need for principled and fearless decisionmaking, wanting the official in question to put energy and effort into the duties of his office rather than diverting them to fight off lawsuits that may be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.199" offset="2885758">The Court has felt that these interests are especially involved in the proper administration of justice and that there is a need to avoid the adverse effect in the functioning of the criminal justice system that less than this immunity would in fact allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.576" offset="2947198">We believe, of course, that this is inherent in the situation in this case because, as we have said, this instance, this action, is part of the judicial proceeding, the question and the issuance of the warrant being an integral part of the judicial process and any criminal proceedings that would--</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.163" offset="5557562">I would emphasize that, that we do see some policy differences between a warrant for an arrest and a warrant for a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.486" offset="5590895">The policy considerations that the Court has identified for considering whether or not absolute immunity should apply don't seem to apply to the same extent to an application for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.059" offset="5641154">Primarily, our feeling is that, because the search warrant does not put the issue into the judicial proceedings in the same way as an application for an arrest warrant would, the same kind of protection that the Court has looked for in its immunity analysis may not be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.671" offset="5711580">We don't believe that issue needs to he decided by the Court in order to decide this case, but we do realize that there might be some different kind of policy concerns in an application for an arrest warrant... I mean, for a search warrant, that do not exist in an application for an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.066" offset="5781171">The second policy consideration that the Court has identified is whether the official's actions are likely to result in retaliatory lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.486" offset="5810846">This is important to the Court, especially within the judicial process, because the Court feels that within the judicial process there are cases that arouse the most intense feelings in the litigants and these feelings are not easily capped by a judicial decree or decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.163" offset="5869569">The power of the state is being exercised in the courtroom or in the judicial process, and the Court has recognized that it is natural that there will be resentment, that there will be intense emotions involved in whatever decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.221" offset="5921814">And because of that, because of that intense there is the possibility of scores of lawsuit emotion, or at least lawsuits with a great deal of frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.345" offset="5962356">The Court is concerned about this because, of course, it does not wish the judicial officer or the actor in the judicial process to spend enormous amounts of time defending suits instead of doing the official's judicial acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.472" offset="9802878">This Court has always used the functional analysis and has held judges and prosecutors and legislators in the legislative function to be immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.715" offset="9859825">In Imbler this Court held that the prosecutor was immune, but left open the question of whether this immunity attached by virtue of the nature of the office or by nature of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.856" offset="9908413">Later on in Mitchell, I think... although the Court did refer to other cases which had not extended immunity to every phase, later on Mitchell this Court decided that the Attorney General of the United States was not immune in everything he did, that it had to be connected with the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.466" offset="9970793">And the reason for this, as Mr. Justice White has so eloquently stated, is the protection of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.155" offset="10009559">That's what we're talking about here, the protection of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.856" offset="10024397">It's for the purpose of protecting the judicial process that the prosecuting attorney is given immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.629" offset="10055430">He must be free to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.564" offset="10063162">And this protects defendants as well as the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.616" offset="10079358">It protects the public because he's not fettered in bringing actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.568" offset="10091166">It protects defendants because he doesn't have to fear being sued civilly and thus refrain from dismissing an action once trial has started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.240" offset="10125856">And it also protects the defendant in giving freedom to the reviewing judge, who might even subconsciously react knowing that if he turned the case over the prosecuting attorney could be immune from suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.363" offset="12694424">The only good faith that we'd be talking about is the objective standard of good faith that has been announced in Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.517" offset="12723055">If the Court please, in Briscoe, I think that Briscoe gives us an answer to the Petitioners' claim that the police functions here are judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.013" offset="12801004">In Briscoe a policeman was given absolute immunity because he was a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.048" offset="12821171">Now, if he had immunity by virtue of his investigative functions or the functions we're talking about here, it wouldn't have been necessary to recite that the reason he was given absolute immunity was because he was a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.892" offset="12880521">And again, that is part of the purpose for which the immunity or the functions analysis has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.998" offset="12916883">That is, protection of the fairness of the system, protection of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.652" offset="12935587">The judicial team is the judge, the prosecutor, and the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.555" offset="12955127">Now, the Petitioner wants this to be expanded to a situation where the police will be held as part of the judicial team.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.411" offset="12994624">And I must take issue with my colleague's statement that this is only one small part of the police duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.565" offset="13023149">I think the police duties... the issue we're talking about is pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.719" offset="13039763">And if you said that investigating the case and having that investigation culminate in application for a warrant is part of the judicial function or the judicial process, then most of what a policeman does will be immune, because the investigation begins with the arrest and the arrest begins with statements from other people, or may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.750" offset="13135894">And again, we open the door wide and we have a police state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.290" offset="13178108">If the Court please, at common law, our court has stated time and time again, there was no absolute immunity for police, and I cannot accept my colleague's statement that this is limited to one small instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.566" offset="13235159">As I said, once you say that either by application for a warrant the police are insulated or that the police in doing this are performing a prosecutorial or judicial function, then you open up the door wide to virtually everything that a policeman does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.648" offset="13327528">Well, if the reasoning for reversing the First Circuit here would be that the police officer simply submitted it for the magistrate's judgment and it was reasonable for him to execute something that had been approved by the magistrate, that reasoning wouldn't apply at all to police making arrests or making searches without warrants?</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.043" offset="13401089">Well, I think, Your Honor, with due respect, that that would beg the question, because you're saying that the reasonableness of the police... again, in this case we're not talking about the policeman who executed it; we're talking about the policeman who applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.119" offset="13453438">But what I say is that the evil of accepting the insulation theory is that you open the door wide, and if you're going to insulate the policeman by virtue of the magistrate's issuing the warrant then it will insulate the applying officer, it will insulate the executing officer, and there will just be no holds barred.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann M. Sheadel</label>
            <text syncTime="3367.863" offset="13616442">Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.981" offset="13632847">We believe that this Court's policy considerations that it has enunciated in support of applying immunity apply in this case to support not only absolute immunity, but qualified immunity as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.289" offset="13682062">We believe that under the Harlow objectively reasonable standard qualified immunity should be applied in this situation to state that a police officer who applies to a magistrate for a warrant is per se reasonable if the only allegation is that the police officer should have known that the facts recited in his affidavit were insufficient to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.071" offset="13769207">We believe that the Court's policy considerations mandate this result and that the First Circuit standard is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.808" offset="13800135">The First Circuit standard, being that the police officer should be liable for civil damages if he should have known that the facts recited in his affidavit were insufficient to establish probable cause, will in fact require the reviewing court to examine each case to decide, first of all, if probable cause did in fact exist; and second of all, if it did not exist, whether a police officer should have known that it did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.174" offset="13897624">We believe that the Court's policy considerations looking at being part of the judicial proceeding, encouraging and wanting the police officer to apply to the magistrate for an arrest warrant, the policy considerations of looking at the safeguards that are part of this procedure, all go toward accepting the rule that applying to a magistrate for an arrest warrant is in fact per se reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.777" offset="14008070">We do not believe that this standard will eviscerate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.229" offset="14021863">We do believe that this standard will effectuate the policies of this Court in encouraging police officers to apply to magistrates for warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.787" offset="14068047">Therefore, in conclusion, we urge this Court to rule that a police officer who applies to a magistrate for an arrest warrant cannot be held liable for civil damages if the only allegation is that he should have known that the facts recited in his affidavit were not sufficient to establish probable cause for arrest.</text>
