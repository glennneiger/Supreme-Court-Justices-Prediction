            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135334">We'll hear arguments next in Nantahala Power against the Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.356" offset="164696">Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="182563">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.850" offset="194684">Notwithstanding the length of the lower court's opinion and notwithstanding the variety of the Appellees' arguments, this is at bottom a simple case whose solution is controlled by one simple and eminently sensible principle of law, namely that the Federal Power Act requires state regulators, when they set retail electric rates, to include within those rates power supply costs incurred as a result of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's rate schedules and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.894" offset="338880">Today much of our nation's electricity is distributed under interstate arrangements which are subject at one stage of the process to FERC's wholesale regulatory authority, and then at a later stage to local retail ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.686" offset="401992">It is also quite common that interstate electric suppliers have more than one source of power and that the costs of the different sources vary widely.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.481" offset="441176">Where that occurs, each affected state would like to have for itself and its consumers as much as possible of the low cost power and as little as possible of the high cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.289" offset="492480">Someone has to decide who gets how much of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.274" offset="512333">The logical candidate, indeed the only logical candidate, is FERC, because it is the only regulatory authority that, even as a theoretical matter, has no reason to favor the interests of one state over those of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.063" offset="575550">Appropriately enough, it is a series of state supreme court decisions which have held that the Federal Power Act requires that logical result, that is that the Federal Power Act requires that state regulators include all FERC-regulated power supply costs in the retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.915" offset="654962">This does not preclude the states from their customary function of setting the retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.219" offset="672203">It simply fixes one of the cost components.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.954" offset="691115">Here the question involves the competing interests of two states, Tennessee and North Carolina, and two electric retailers, both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Alcoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.519" offset="729358">One of them, Nantahala Power and Light, serves exclusively a public load in North Carolina; and the other, Tapoco, Inc., serves only Alcoa's aluminum plant in Tennessee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="170.202" offset="816085">I would say, Justice Rehnquist, on the order of 50, 60 miles, but I could be off by a few yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.926" offset="838968">During the period at issue, Nantahala and Tapoco operated under two contracts that were filed with FERC as rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.893" offset="874808">Under one of them, called the New Fontana Agreement, TVA incorporates the hydroelectric generation of these two companies into its system and then delivers back electricity which is lesser in quantity, but more dependable.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.103" offset="943667">These NFA entitlements from TVA were divided between Nantahala and Tapoco by a 1971 apportionment agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.807" offset="974492">Prior to that time, that is prior to 1971, Nantahala's entitlements had been sufficient for its customers' needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.874" offset="1010750">But since then, Nantahala, like Tapoco before it, has had to purchase additional power from TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.831" offset="1042619">And these TVA power purchases cost more than three times as much as the hydro entitlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.316" offset="1076578">So that for each company, the power supply cost is a blend cost, resulting in the consequence that an increase in the amount of its entitlements for either company means a decrease in its purchases and consequently a decrease in its total cost of power and in its customers' electric bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.861" offset="1170723">And that's what the dispute in this case is all about: How much of this low cost entitlement power should be allocated to Nantahala's customers, all of whom are in North Carolina, and how much to Tapoco's customers in Tennessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.242" offset="1232268">In one sense, the case varies from the usual pattern because it involves the allocation of low cost FERC-regulated power, where in each of the Narragansett and Northern States line of cases, the issue was high cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.951" offset="1291096">And yet, high cost power is also at issue here, because for both companies and both states the real cost is the mix of the entitlements and the purchases.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.522" offset="1481372">I mean, it just... there's something missing here.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="339.264" offset="1492343">I appreciate the opportunity to clear that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.257" offset="1500284">Since it had been filed, under this Court's decision in the Montana-Dakota Utilities case, it was binding as a filed rate so long as it was not modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.922" offset="1546991">So that the North Carolina Utilities Commission during the interim period between the filing date and any modification made to it had available to it two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.118" offset="1579801">It could have followed either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.639" offset="1585861">One was simply to wait, to abstain and wait until FERC actually made the allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.105" offset="1615745">The other option was to go ahead and deal with all of the issue except the power supply costs and regard itself as being bound by the power supply that was reflected in the filed rate, the NFA as filed, subject to any refund that might be due once FERC modified the schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.288" offset="1712398">Clearly what it was bound by was the filed rate up until the time that it was actually modified.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="399.624" stopTime="409.209">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="399.624" offset="1733819">So it's your view that North Carolina was bound by that apportionment agreement, even though FERC later changed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="409.209" stopTime="452.238">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="409.209" offset="1772167">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.220" offset="1776137">And then once FERC made the change, then North Carolina could similarly go back and make the same change that was reflected in the FERC agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.918" offset="1814903">And that is the thrust of Narragansett and Northern States and these various state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.340" offset="1832666">The only exception is the North Carolina Supreme Court decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.803" offset="1858475">What North Carolina did here, Justice O'Connor, by departing from that procedure was to take from Tennessee in effect a share that properly belonged to Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.174" offset="1927961">By sweetening its own mix, it increased the cost to Tennessee.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="452.238" offset="1944261">Well, what if Nantahala had gone out and purchased high cost power at a rate on file with FERC, which the North Carolina Utilities Commission subsequently decided Nantahala had imprudently and unnecessarily purchased?</text>
            <text syncTime="473.372" offset="2028794">And why is this different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="475.512" stopTime="621.920">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="475.512" offset="2037362">It's different for this reason, that that simply is not the fact in this case, and there was no issue of whether this particular purchase or this particular arrangement, the NFA, in which it got low cost power, was or was not prudent--</text>
            <text syncTime="492.103" offset="2103713">The question that you have just raised is the question that is raised by the Pike County and Sinclair Machine Products case.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.649" offset="2137881">That is a difficult issue that this Court need not resolve, namely in those instances where FERC does not actually face and decide the question of how they should be allocated, where FERC could have decided it but did not, is that then binding on the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="519.101" offset="2211651">That's a difficult question and a close one, but it need not be resolved in this case, because in this case the only issue is how should these entitlements be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.368" offset="2248745">FERC has made that decision, and under the Narragansett and Northern States line of cases that decision is binding on FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.273" offset="2284376">It is also our position that the economic preference that North Carolina has erected for itself by sweetening its mix of the entitlements between the purchases and the entitlement power is a violation of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.809" offset="2366505">But this Court need not reach the commerce clause issue because of the availability of a statutory ground for the decision, and that statutory ground is the availability of this Narragansett-Northern States doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.555" offset="2417496">The Appellees really do not argue, or they do not purport to argue, with the basic Narragansett principle, but they contend that it's inapplicable here for a variety of reasons, none of which is on the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.004" offset="2467337">And I would like to examine just very briefly the three assertions that appear with greatest frequency in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.250" offset="2496281">Probably the most frequent is that the FERC rate schedules, the NFA as supplemented by the apportionment agreement, is not a proper basis for making cost allocations, because that agreement is the product of Alcoa's alleged domination of Nantahala and Tapoko.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.410" offset="2564931">The short answer to that allegation is that it comes too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.764" offset="2582381">FERC squarely considered it and rejected it, and FERC's position was sustained by the Fourth Circuit in an appeal taken by these Appellees.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.920" offset="2622923">Well, why is North Carolina bound by that?</text>

            <text syncTime="628.465" offset="2649150">It was initiated by Nantahala's wholesale customers, but apparently because they sensed that coming out of that proceeding would be an allocation of the NFA entitlements, the North Carolina Attorney General intervened in those FERC proceedings and participated fully throughout them, and he made very clear that he was intervening on behalf of interests of all of Nantahala's retail customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.073" offset="2759595">And then, once FERC had made its decision, the North Carolina Attorney General appealed to the Fourth Circuit on the ground that FERC had not given enough of the entitlement power to the retailers.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.370" offset="2868787">We submit that the reason that it is the filed rate doctrine is that the NFA as supplemented by the apportionment agreement did make an apportionment of the entitlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.770" offset="2926361">FERC then considered this very argument, that it should not be a... that it was not a fair basis for apportionment of the entitlement because of Alcoa's alleged domination of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.719" offset="2982158">And what it concluded was that the NFA was in all respects fair, but that an adjustment needed to be made to the 1971 apportionment agreement, and it made the adjustment that in FERC's judgment was necessary in order to constitute just and reasonable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.736" offset="3214230">--Yes, and you're right, Justice Rehnquist, this is an extension of the Montana-Dakota, of the Montana-Dakota principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.570" offset="3237532">It is a correct extension, I submit, for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.072" offset="3251533">First of all, the very purpose of part two of the Federal Power Act was to close the Attleboro gap and to eliminate the overlap between the possible competing between state and federal jurisdictions, and to best... and to give the wholesale regulatory authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, than the Federal Power Commission, because of the fact that this Court in Attleboro had held that the states did not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.395" offset="3384862">In the event that the states could then come along and, once these power supply costs had been determined at wholesale, could say, we disagree with them at the retail rate, it would simply permit the states to do by indirection what they cannot do directly, and that is to in effect overturn FERC's determination for the only purpose that really matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.422" offset="3488934">The purpose that really matters for the allocation of these entitlements and therefore the allocation of the purchases is in the setting of retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.680" offset="3538044">As Tennessee points out in its amicus brief, if North Carolina can do what it has purported to do, what it has attempted to do in this case, that is to key the amount of its entitlements to what it needs, rather than to FERC's determinations, there is no reason that Tennessee couldn't do the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.874" offset="3746815">If we're right that Narraganset-Northern States is good law, then it follows that the only allocation that the states can use is the allocation that was used by FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.705" offset="3810136">And if we're not right, then the only issue, of course, is Narragansett-Northern States.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.150" offset="3835840">But if we are correct, then North Carolina must use that allocation in determining its revenue requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.186" offset="4308030">In order to do that, it concluded that it had to give additional power, additional cheap entitlement power, to Nantahala.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.966" offset="4427148">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.488" offset="4445225">The North Carolina Supreme Court recognized that the New Fontana Agreement and the 1971 apportionment agreement were contracts filed with and accepted by FERC setting forth terms for the sale of power at wholesale in interstate commerce; and that the North Carolina Utilities Commission was... and I'll quote the North Carolina Supreme Court because the point can't be said any better...</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.508" offset="4565283">"was preempted from inquiring into the reasonableness of those FERC filed rates when it acts in fixing Nantahala's retail rate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.097" offset="4615647">The North Carolina Supreme Court had, however, two defenses for what the North Carolina Utilities Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.467" offset="4669146">First, the North Carolina Supreme Court said that the State Commission was not questioning the FERC filed allocation of low cost power, that is to say the terms on which Nantahala acquired power at wholesale, but was merely determining what costs could properly be imposed on retail customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.716" offset="4786175">It analogized cases where state utility commissions have accepted the wholesale cost, but found that a particular wholesale cost was offset by savings elsewhere or was, as in for example the case of a research cost, not a particular cost that ought to be imposed on particular retail customers, or cases where state commissions have found that power purchase costs were unreasonable because power could have been acquired more cheaply from a different available source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.567" offset="4981571">None of those things is what the North Carolina Utilities Commission did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.042" offset="5007484">What it did here, as stated by the North Carolina Supreme Court... I'm at page 15A of the joint appendix... was to find that significant detriments and inequities to Nantahala arise out of the New Fontana Agreement and the 1971 apportionment agreement, and render use of the company's cost allocation formula based on the demand and energy entitlements under those contracts inappropriate for determining the costs fairly attributable to the North Carolina public load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.084" offset="5155651">In other words, the State Commission simply substituted a different and what it thought would be fairer arrangement among the same parties with respect to dividing the low cost power, instead of the 1971 agreement and instead of FERC's determination of a proper apportionment after FERC had reviewed that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.508" offset="5285323">Let me comment briefly on a distinction between two allocation decisions that North Carolina made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.195" offset="5344046">North Carolina decided that it would be appropriate to roll in, to combine the two utilities' costs for purposes of determining now their costs... what their costs were of producing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.299" offset="5428474">That is not the major problem with what North Carolina did, and it would not necessarily conflict with either the filed agreements or the FERC modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.292" offset="5496496">What North Carolina did that creates the problem here was to apportion the entitlements power that the two utilities received back from TVA in a way that different both with their contractual apportionment and with the apportionment that FERC found to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.558" offset="5601509">In sum, I think North Carolina was doing precisely what the Supreme Court had acknowledged it could not do, and that was altering the terms of the wholesale transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.145" offset="5651873">Now, the North Carolina court's second line of defense was that the FERC proceedings themselves somehow freed the Utilities Commission to do what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.803" offset="5698475">The argument is that FERC found the apportionment unfair, but failed to modify it, and thus conferred the power on North Carolina to determine Nantahala's wholesale costs as it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.264" offset="5756363">I think that's wrong for two reasons, apart from the commerce clause problem that would be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.812" offset="5790531">First, FERC had accepted the two agreements for filing, and North Carolina was bound to honor the apportionment set forth in those agreements unless and until they were modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.041" offset="5855419">North Carolina had a statutory right to challenge the rates, the apportionment, at FERC or to ask FERC to clarify if there were any doubt that the adjustment FERC made in favor of Nantahala could be assumed for retail rate setting purposes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.595" offset="5941623">The North Carolina Attorney General did participate at FERC on behalf of North Carolina's retail customers, but he didn't like the outcome at FERC, and so North Carolina took the matter into its own hands and simply fixed its own apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.168" offset="6027932">North Carolina was bound to honor the agreements until they were modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.202" offset="6052069">Second, while the opinions are not models of clarity, I think there is no real doubt that FERC did modify Nantahala's entitlements for all purposes, including retail rate setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.172" offset="6104000">FERC said when it accepted the 1971 agreement for filing, 266A:</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.669" offset="6141930">"The reasonableness of the apportionment arrangements shall be subject to the outcome of the proceedings. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.232" offset="6164186">FERC said in Opinion 139, the key document here, at page 298:</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.348" offset="6200653">"The effect of this opinion is to provide entitlements to Nantahala which will result in just and reasonable rates to its wholesale customers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.716" offset="6254152">There is a reference to wholesale customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.380" offset="6264810">But there is no excuse for reading FERC's statement that it is providing certain entitlements to mean instead that it is assuming entitlements for one purpose only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.918" offset="6318936">Of course, any doubt on this point could have been resolved in the FERC proceedings by the North Carolina Attorney General and by the Town of Highlands, which were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.157" offset="6379958">There are statements in the FERC opinions to the effect that FERC is not reforming the contract, but reforming contracts is not a normal FERC activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.869" offset="6442756">As this Court explained in the Mobile and Sierra case, FERC's basic task is to review rates, which may or may not be embodied in private contracts, and, if it determines that they are not just and reasonable, to set just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.207" offset="6504092">And I think it is reasonably clear that that is what FERC did here, and it accepted the 1971 agreement and then expressly made the reasonableness of the apportionment arrangement subject to the outcome of the then pending proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.058" offset="6571487">And in those proceedings, it then modified Nantahala's entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.844" offset="6602625">The reformation question came up in connection with Highlands' request that FERC alter the obligation to Tapoco, the Tennessee utility, which the administrative law judge declined to do because Highlands had not made out a prima facie case that Tapoco had benefited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.607" offset="6685695">That's where that question first arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.449" offset="6697084">Then when both sides, in what FERC said were confusing contentions, raised issues about retroactivity and whether FERC was impermissibly retroactively changing rates, FERC said, we have not modified the contract, we have merely acted on the Nantahala wholesale rate filing which has been open since it was filed in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.822" offset="6838563">But FERC's 1980 order had included the 1971 filing as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.722" offset="7998191">North Carolina and Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.152" offset="8003938">In that regard, I think it's good for me now to give a more precise answer to Justice Rehnquist's question concerning the location of Tapoco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.290" offset="8052421">Tapoco was the Knoxville Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.462" offset="8065169">It was incorporated as public utility in Tennessee, with the power of eminent domain, which it exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.687" offset="8097979">And only contemporaneously with coming into North Carolina, domesticating there and seeking and getting a certificate of convenience and necessity, which it had to do and could do only if it was a public utility in North Carolina, did it change its name to Tapoco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.732" offset="8178227">It has four hydroelectric projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.932" offset="8190975">Two of them lie across the Tennessee border in Tennessee, two of them lie in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.337" offset="8224621">Corporately, it's domesticated in the state of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.361" offset="8240712">So in effect, Justice Rehnquist, it occupies both states as a corporate entity, and it is a public utility in the state of Tennessee, as well as in the state of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.996" offset="8283239">I think next I should respond to Justice O'Connor's question about imprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.923" offset="8315004">Imprudence was an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.226" offset="8336216">It was almost the issue in this case, because imprudence goes not only to the decision and choice of a supplier as to options that it has with regard to its power supply, but, given a determination properly that that option was not wisely and prudently exercised, it goes to the question, when we flow through the requirement of honoring FERC-set rates, who is to bear the burden of those rates as between the retail ratepayers and the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.220" offset="8488144">One of the things, one of the parts of the lexicon of this case that you should be aware of is that the Appellants are constantly referring to Alcoa as a customer of Tapoco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.441" offset="8549061">It is a customer of Tapoco, but primarily in this case it is a utility company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.686" offset="8581976">Certainly in the state of North Carolina it's a public utility, and it owns two public utility subsidiaries, and as such is the sole stockholder in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.914" offset="8622936">Now, was there any reason for inquiring into Nantahala's prudence in letting itself be manipulated the way it could not otherwise do, being wholly owned by the master Alcoa?</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.853" offset="8686674">Let me quote to you from what our Commission's order said, affirmed, incidentally, by our Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.830" offset="8726590">And I'm on 233A of the appendix:</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.263" offset="8740382">"The Commission must conclude that Alcoa has so dominated these transactions and agreements affecting its wholly owned subsidiary Nantahala that Nantahala has been left but an empty shell, unable to act in its own interests, let alone in the interests of its public utility customers in North Carolina. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.049" offset="8843514">If you want to put that in the context of the Sinclair case and of the Pike Power &amp; Light Company case in Pennsylvania, the analogy I think is pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.139" offset="8895863">Here is a captive subsidiary, owned not by a company that is primarily engaged in the production of power to make money off of that, but to feel its own smeltering process with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.287" offset="8952392">And for that reason, the prudence rule gets abused because the helplessly owned subsidiary cannot make any choice except what the parent lets it make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.135" offset="8999830">They didn't even let Nantahala sign the first Fontana agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.537" offset="9017385">They committed the resources without even letting it sign the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.312" offset="9036506">Nantahala did not negotiate, it didn't participate in the negotiations of the apportionment agreement or the New Fontana Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.786" offset="9070465">They did pay it the perfunctory honor of letting it execute those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.801" offset="9090527">Now, given that kind of domination, massive domination, which is uncontested in this record, and a finding which is not up for review before this Court, I think you can see why someone had to play the role of surrogate for Nantahala.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.542" offset="9161476">And we stand here today as that surrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.844" offset="9178612">The Commission of North Carolina is the proxy for that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.789" offset="9198465">We stand in its shoes, asking for what it ought to ask for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.834" offset="9606603">Justice Rehnquist, let us assume that all of Nantahala and Tapoco, and the Alcoa load too, as far as that's concerned, do in fact constitute one corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.627" offset="9673790">And like CP&amp;L straddling the Carolina borders or Duke, which does the same thing, they are now before the North Carolina Commission to set rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.343" offset="9716630">That is done almost universally by determining what the total demand is that is being satisfied by those companies, then ratioing the portion of that demand that the retail public in North Carolina is putting on that system, and then you allocate costs accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.789" offset="9806387">That's purely and simply what we did here, and I say to you, sir, that that's what we should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.862" offset="9826763">We've already had the concession that piercing the corporate veil didn't particularly bother the Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.117" offset="9851736">I'm glad to hear them say that, because when we did that we were dealing with one entity, we were dealing with one system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.272" offset="9884336">And incidentally, the one entity, one system finding is unchallenged in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.363" offset="9904712">It is not an issue before this Court or subject to being upset by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.767" offset="9922371">So that all North Carolina did was take the agreements as they existed and left them alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.142" offset="9955807">We didn't like them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.305" offset="9968451">We don't think they're reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.265" offset="9976392">But it's like that old adage about the lovely lady: You can look, but don't touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.548" offset="9997499">And we didn't touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.890" offset="10002828">We looked, but we didn't touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.332" offset="10012650">We did not disturb those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.713" offset="10022158">We left them right where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.365" offset="10028741">Now, the methodology arrived at certainly has historic actual and judicial foundations for honoring by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.435" offset="10089032">It has been held... and we have cited the cases in the briefs... numerously that the methodologies employed in setting retail rates need not be the same as followed by the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.653" offset="10141904">Let me give you some of the largesse that the company got the benefit of in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.505" offset="10161339">We let them redepreciate their war... depreciated assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.671" offset="10181923">FERC denied it in 139A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.373" offset="10200732">We let them put on a purchase power adjustment clause in North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.988" offset="10227272">FERC is an original cost rate base Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.659" offset="10245871">We are a fair value rate base Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.251" offset="10260291">There is nothing that dictates that every nuance and refinement of methodology followed by the federal Commission has got to be adhered to by the Commissions that regulate retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.872" offset="10314730">And if there were such a thing as that, I think you could certainly be looking at madness throughout the Union today, rather than a fairly logical and well-oiled scheme that allows a balanced and equitable sharing of these responsibilities as between the states and retailers on the one hand and the federal government and interstate wholesale transactions on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.935" offset="10711060">There were three wholesale customers: one university, one electric cooperative, and one Town of Highlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.981" offset="10747213">And only in an ancillary sense did the NFA and the apportionment agreement get into it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.113" offset="10815758">But I think it's important to give you the quotation from the FERC order on North Carolina's right to do that, because they paid deference to that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.226" offset="10892141">And I'm on page 23 of our brief:</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.998" offset="10903321">FERC Commission's order...</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.601" offset="10925682">"we recognize that the North Carolina Utilities Commission, based on a similar record, reached a different conclusion concerning rolled-in costing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.648" offset="10969881">"However, the question of whether to treat various entities as an integrated system for ratemaking purposes is not a purely factual question, but also rests on criteria which each ratemaking authority may deem relevant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.662" offset="11045950">Now, we say to you that, if not expressly, certainly impliedly FERC was saying: Well, we recognize the fact... and we were first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.050" offset="11095478">Our order had come down before this order was written, at least our initial order had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.192" offset="11116062">So our final order has come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.116" offset="11131736">We've gone one route on this issue of roll-in, which would have required in effect the piercing of the corporate veil, and North Carolina has gone the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.285" offset="11180428">Well, we recognize that different Commissions have different criteria, different standards in determinations for performing their particular rate regulating functions, and that's fine with us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.205" offset="11712072">Now, the battle that I alluded to, and I'm sorry I deviated from, was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.326" offset="11728581">Alcoa came into North Carolina in the early part of this century and it wanted to dam up our streams, generate cheap hydroelectric power, gargantuan quantities of which are required to smelt aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.044" offset="11779468">And they suddenly ran into a phenomenon that is not indigenous to the mountain people of Tennessee and North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.538" offset="11809456">I think it pervades the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.811" offset="11818547">People don't want their land dammed and lakes built on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.604" offset="11837669">They don't want privately and voluntarily to sell out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.567" offset="11853551">So what did Alcoa do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.931" offset="11867030">First of all, it bought a utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.291" offset="11876434">That was Tallassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.180" offset="11879987">Tallassee's name was changed to Carolina Aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.334" offset="11896601">Carolina Aluminum's name was changed to Yadkin, Inc. See, we're getting farther and farther away from the concept of a utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.530" offset="11925440">And yet, it was Carolina Aluminum who sold, transferred, the two dams in North Carolina to Tapoco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.932" offset="11951040">What they did, they created these subsidiaries with the power of eminent domain, and they not only exercised that power with respect to condemnation proceedings, they pervasively exercised it in threatening people to give up their land who otherwise wouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.996" offset="12027318">And under the guise of a public utility they then went in and acquired the rights to build the dams, generate the power, and then by corporate manipulation, spinning off these facilities' ownership from Nantahala to Tapoco, drained all of the low cost power to Alcoa in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.608" offset="12117701">And the higher cost power was left to the people who were served in North Carolina, and it would have been true if they had been serving across the line in Tennessee as far as that is concerned, which we did for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.068" offset="12163572">We did for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.519" offset="12169319">The wrongness of that was first recognized by our Supreme Court in 1954 in the Mead Corporation case, which we cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.266" offset="12208398">As a matter of fact, I think we close with a quotation from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.607" offset="12225744">It was found by our court to be a wrong in 1963, when Alcoa attempted to shed its public utility responsibility by selling off its distribution system and customers and retaining these hydro facilities for its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.379" offset="12296797">And then, of course, it has attempted to do the same thing through the NFA and the apportionment agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.114" offset="12323755">Now, let me conclude, if I may, by asking just three of four rhetorical questions and making one request and taking note of an historical marker which today is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.858" offset="12406720">Why do we stand here as proxy for the company?</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.069" offset="12423543">Why isn't the company up here arguing for what in effect is a real good deal for it under the North Carolina Commission's order?</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.316" offset="12464503">Why didn't it fight for that kind of benefit upstairs in FERC?</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.130" offset="12487804">Well, the answer is very simple and I don't think they would even deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.743" offset="12502224">They're helpless to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.274" offset="12512359">They're put in the absolute ridiculous posture of opposing their own best interests, which then of course flows down to the detriment of the customers, because they are captive to a wholly owned master who is not a public utility in the traditional sense, but is in business to make money by making and selling aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.449" offset="12605042">Why is our Commission acting as their surrogate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.732" offset="12618207">Who else is there to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.214" offset="12624163">Shall we go into court and ask for the appointment of a conservator or a trustor to bring this action on its behalf against its parent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.629" offset="12657809">This is the logical way that the problem ought to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.072" offset="12671602">And I say to you that it has taken 35 years of litigation and over 50 years of discovery really to get this nasty picture out and revealed for the very, very terrible thing that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.621" offset="12733773">And it's nothing more nor less than an absconsion by a corporate giant, a multinational corporate giant, of public assets preferred to its own benefit and to the expense of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.750" offset="12802318">Surely that makes appropriate then this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.375" offset="12820813">They come here as a last desperate effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.396" offset="12836905">I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.850" offset="12854668">They never raised their federal questions until they filed their first brief on exceptions to the initial Commission order issued in September of 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.280" offset="13032405">And not until that last moment, so to speak, did they raise this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.173" offset="13059990">But they are latecomers to that theory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.456" offset="13073156">Finally, today marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto, and I think everybody in this room knows what happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.876" offset="13142746">A real smart Sam Houston, knowing that Mexican take siesta, waited until about 4:00 o'clock and then, with the sun behind his back and some 600 soldiers, really decimated Santa Ana's army.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.003" offset="13235324">How does that bear on what's going on here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.515" offset="13245355">Texas became a liberated, independent republic, and it wavered for several years before it opted as to whether to come into this Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.352" offset="13292689">Very independent people, nobody would gainsay that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.634" offset="13309825">But they finally opted to come, and one of the reasons they came... and Sam Houston was one of the proponents for it... was that the Constitution held this balance of powers between semi-sovereign states and a federal union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.987" offset="13383282">And we're talking here today, Chief Justice Burger and fellow Justices, we're talking here today about balancing equity between the federal scheme of regulation and the state of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.736" offset="13442214">And the wrong that has been done, the wrong that has been done, cannot be corrected by merely invoking carte blanche a set of principles that have come down in other, really inapplicable cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.356" offset="13624758">What the Appellees are asking this Court to do, and the only thing they're asking this Court to do, is to perform the function of deciding what is a fair and just allocation of these entitlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.314" offset="13676585">That is not the function of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.647" offset="13685884">It is not the issue before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.089" offset="13695602">That is a decision that has already been made by the only authority that has the power to make it, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.603" offset="13725695">It can be asserted on the one side that it's a nasty picture, a terrible thing by a corporate giant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.067" offset="13751504">It can be asserted on the other side, as we have quoted in our brief, that Alcoa is the best friend that North Carolina ever had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.192" offset="13784000">These are the lowest rates in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.483" offset="13793195">This Court is not the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.425" offset="13808973">The only issue for this Court is who is going to call these balls and strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.630" offset="13825796">Is it going to be a neutral umpire, or is it going to be the catcher, or is it going to be the batter?</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.832" offset="13846590">The only facts that the Appellees say are relevant to this case are all, every one... count them... facts that pertain to their allegations of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.581" offset="13897581">It is not the proper function of this Court and it would be a misallocation of this Court's resources to sift through those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.734" offset="13926211">Our point is that there is a filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.838" offset="13942616">It is the NFA and the apportionment agreement, and that controls unless and until it is modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.432" offset="13964976">Once it is modified, then it is the modified version that must control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.205" offset="13980127">And the only alternative is the kind of chaos that led to, 200 years ago, the invocation of a Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.052" offset="14023491">In the event that the Court should not decide this case on that ground, then in must reach the commerce clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.284" offset="14052434">And there is no question that this case is indistinguishable from what happened in NEPCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.560" offset="14073541">The better procedure, we submit, is to follow the lead of the state supreme court decisions which have held that, where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has made a power supply cost determination, that that power supply cost determination then becomes binding on the state and local regulators when they make their retail ratemaking decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.177" offset="14180016">Unless the Court has questions, I have nothing further.</text>
