            <text syncTime="58.478" offset="363383">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.117" offset="369966">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.428" offset="379161">We are faced today with two issues of great import.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.427" offset="399223">The first issue is whether the voluntariness of a confession is a question of fact to which this Court and lower federal courts must defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.626" offset="427958">And the second issue is whether the Petitioner's confession was involuntarily obtained by police practices which operated to overhear his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.795" offset="464634">We submit that the Court of Appeals' use of the presumption of correctness deprived Petitioner of his statutory right to federal plenary judicial review, and if this Court affirms the decision below, it will displace the ultimate authority to decide the questions of constitutionality of confession from federal courts where Congress placed it and where this Court has consistently recognized it belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.940" offset="573199">With regard to this issue, it is crucial that we look to the nature of the voluntariness inquiry itself and to the nature of the federal courts' role in constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.374" offset="614995">We would first contend that the nature of the voluntariness inquiry itself makes it a mixed question not subject to the strictures of section 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="130.886" offset="653029">The constitutionally required test is totality.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.838" offset="668807">This is an indivisible concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.478" offset="675390">It is not just a review of facts but the application of law to those facts, not just determine--</text>

            <text syncTime="199.967" offset="929300">Why does the question of whether a guilty plea was knowingly or intelligently made differ from the question of whether a confession was voluntarily given so far as credibility and everything else?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.792" offset="972663">--When you are dealing with voluntariness of a confession and you have a defendant or a petitioner in front of you, you cannot deal with the assessment of credibility and demeanor at a closed, inherently secret and inherently coercive setting such as an interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.643" offset="1048105">The Court in Marshall v. Lonberger was able to question the defendant there and was also able to look to state court records of things that were conducted in open court, with a court stenographer, with all the safeguards available to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.589" offset="1123860">You don't have that in an interrogation situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.910" offset="1493127">And how many Justices of the Court joined the opinion from which you are quoting?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_martin_klein" startTime="345.159" stopTime="686.866">
            <label>Mr. Paul Martin Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="345.159" offset="1510159">I thought it was three or four.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.612" offset="1519981">Certainly I think the concern of Congress has been that the state court, state courts are not insulated enough from local community sentiment, from the question of guilt and innocence itself, and that a further proceeding would be needed in this court to protect, to ultimately vindicate those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.038" offset="1629591">Now, if you look at the problem here, if you look at what the state court had before it, it is the same thing that this Court has before it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.738" offset="1672431">What it had on one hand were a set of pure historical facts, and on the other hand, undisputed rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.314" offset="1698763">That law is whether under the totality of the circumstances petitioner's will had been overborne; was his confession compelled from him, and the state court took that undisputed rule of law, applied it to the facts, and reached the conclusion that the law in fact had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.727" offset="1768353">This by definition is a mixed question, and what the Third Circuit did, we contend, was to abdicate its duty to this argument's question of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.552" offset="1815687">What it did was classify as pure fact certain conclusions of the state court, and when we look at those conclusions, one of the conclusions was that the distress and ultimate collapse of petitioner after giving his confession was caused by realization of what he had done, and that when he confessed he was aware that he would be handled through the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.730" offset="1908369">These we contend are not pure historical facts, but require application of law to the facts to reach that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.006" offset="1945463">That conclusion in itself is dispositive of the constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.130" offset="1961973">When you say that someone collapsed or was in distress because of a realization of what he had done, you are basically saying that his will had not... his confession had not been compelled from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.811" offset="2020696">These are not the types of facts that Section 2254(d) was intended to encompass.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.934" offset="2045251">I think what 2254(d) intended to encompass were findings of either pure historical fact, facts that this Court has defined as recitation of the external events and the credibility of their narrator, or inferences from those facts which can be made without reference to legal standard, without applying the standard of law to the facts in reaching a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.331" offset="2146815">For example, if in this case petitioner had claimed that he had been starved or that he had no working knowledge of the English language, all you need do is go to the record and listen to defendant speaking, listen to petitioner speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.339" offset="2210867">The judge was able to observe petitioner in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.494" offset="2223511">Petitioner did testify at a pretrial hearing, and you can infer from what happened that in fact he did have an understanding of the legal... of the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.694" offset="2260291">The same with the allegation, if you raise it, that he had been starved.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.395" offset="2279099">The police certainly offered him food, and you could determine this from the record and thus, these conclusions would have been dispositive of the ultimate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.391" offset="2323089">They were not mixed questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.859" offset="2332911">We would contend that to adopt the position of the Third Circuit is to thwart congressional intent to have federal courts serve as the ultimate vindicators of habeas petitioners' constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.978" offset="2381395">We briefly mentioned the recent cases, and I do say that these cases, most of them recognized that when you are talking about mixed questions of law and fact, you're talking about a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.878" offset="2452970">And I still think that Congress and this Court has been very concerned with the setting that the petitioners are in when they are being interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.560" offset="2503752">And with this regard, when we refer to state of mind in the recent cases such as Patton and Maggio, Rushen v. Spain, you are talking about something different from the state of mind in a voluntariness case, voluntariness of confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.538" offset="2567595">State of mind is really synonymous with whether petitioner voluntarily gave the confession, and certainly state of mind cannot be determined other than by inference from what had happened, from the facts that you have, drawing inferences, getting at the truth is a very difficult situation in voluntariness cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.028" offset="2673548">I would also note that in the Third Circuit they referred to Miranda warnings as also causing some kind of doctrinal upheaval.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.630" offset="2731958">We would submit that in this case or in all cases, Miranda warnings have not replaced the voluntariness test, the voluntariness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.315" offset="2766753">That is a prophylactic rule, and it is not designed to do away with the test involved in Hutto v. Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.046" offset="2809698">The Court... there the petitioner had in fact been given his Miranda warnings and had counsel present, and these were just factors to assess in reaching the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.242" offset="2858495">The state of mind is just one part of the equation in a voluntariness of confession case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.843" offset="5140866">At the outset we did note that there was no question but that petitioner had received his warnings, and we are not contending that he didn't understand those warnings when they were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.151" offset="5182139">What we are contending is that we have to look at what the interrogator did after the warnings were given, and I think it's clear that the entire thrust of the interrogation was to divert petitioner from the reality of the criminal justice system, to undermine any of the warnings that had been given previously, and to ultimately overbear petitioner's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.674" offset="5264164">The detective employed a series of lies, deceptions and promises during a constant psychological assault assuring petitioner over and over and over again that it was the detective's job to get him help, that petitioner was not a criminal, that he was not responsible for what had happened, and that he should receive help instead of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.000" offset="5445453">I would contend that there was absolutely no balance involved in what the police officer did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.325" offset="5470740">Certainly if he had said my job is to get you help, and I'm here to make sure that you get help and I'm going to make sure that you get proper psychiatric evaluation, a comfortable cell and three square meals for the rest of your life, we wouldn't be here today because there would be a balance and you would be basically letting petitioner know where he stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.690" offset="5560288">The purpose of Miranda, one of the main purposes was to ensure that the petitioner knew that he was in an adversarial situation and that the police or the people conducting the interrogation were not necessarily acting in his best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.060" offset="5625698">And what's fascinating, what the police did here, they had this chicane all the way through, and it continued until the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.619" offset="5659971">At the very end of the confession, right before petitioner collapsed, the police officer said I understand you'll be willing to sit down and talk with me and an assistant prosecutor and indicate to him that you have a problem so that you can get help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.549" offset="5715664">The equation was throughout, problem and help, not crime and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.252" offset="5734472">What the interrogating agent did and what we contend he had absolutely no business doing was to invoke the spectre of a sentencing judge, and what he accomplished, we feel, was to undermine the effect of the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.715" offset="5788389">The attorney general in her brief tries to separate each incident into a world of its own, and we contend that in this type of a situation you can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.851" offset="5828931">It's like a mosaic, each little piece fits together and ultimately draws a picture as to what happened, and the same came be said with regard to the will of the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.925" offset="5865189">Each little deception, each little promise acted like a weight that was placed upon him, and while one little weight might not have made a difference, by the time the interrogating agent was done placing these weights upon him, he succeeded in crushing him and taking away any option not to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.887" offset="5945019">We contend that a legitimization of these skillful techniques basically serves to reward an interrogator who is clever enough or devious enough to avoid brutality and serves to undermine the entire spirit of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.349" offset="6006877">We recognize that it is a legitimate object to create an atmosphere where a defendant might bear witness to the truth, but you have to recognize that that atmosphere cannot be made so as to take the option away from petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.226" offset="6142400">Even under an independent review standard, Mr. Miller's 1973 confession to the brutal murder of 17 year old Deborah Margolin should be found voluntary, and so it was by both the New Jersey Supreme Court and the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.392" offset="6203004">However, this Court need never reach that issue because as respondents submit, under 2254(d), deference should be accorded to the factual findings of the state court, including, as in this case, the factual finding concerning Miller's state of mind, that is, that his will was not overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.979" offset="6277401">Since the factual findings by the state supreme court were fairly supported by the record, the Third Circuit properly paid deference to them, and having also found that the state court applied the correct legal standard, properly concluded that the confession was voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.966" offset="9789303">Well, even if we were to accept that deception was used in this case, I don't think it affects the bottom line of what the decision should be because the will was not overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.817" offset="9868715">Defendant's will was not overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.052" offset="9873731">His decision to confess was a product of his free will and rational mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.127" offset="9894002">That is I think one of the critical facts of the case, and I think that's probably--</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.281" offset="9926603">Well, do you think the record can be interpreted to mean that he would have confessed had there been no deception at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.636" offset="9972056">It took him an hour and a half, or about an hour, I guess, to get him to confess.</text>

            <label>Ms. Anne C. Paskow</label>
            <text syncTime="2468.992" offset="10005493">Well, no defendant is going to be eager to convey his involvement in a murder of this type, of course, but defendant at all times throughout this indicated his willingness to talk, and the officer testified at the voluntariness Miranda hearing that it was his feeling that defendant wanted to talk and just wanted to come out with what he had done to relieve himself of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.138" offset="10098071">Again, the offers to see that defendant receive psychological help and the sympathetic approach adopted by the detective we would say really focus on whether or not the will was overborne, and defendant in this case always understood that Boyce was a police officer acting as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.482" offset="10235370">Similarly, the most damaging evidence that was presented to this defendant in the course of the interrogation was the observations of his car at the farm before the murder and the blood stains on his vehicle, and this really was the linchpin leading him to confess in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.865" offset="10332964">With respect to his demeanor during the interrogation, he was lucid, coherent, rational, he was cynical at times, independent and argumentative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.799" offset="10372670">He weighed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.484" offset="10379462">He was able to fabricate a story, trying to exculpate himself, and when he realized that failed, he was not able to account for the time period in some of this compelling evidence, he confessed only then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.246" offset="10418436">Thus we would say that even on a plenary review in this matter, it would demonstrate that the confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.586" offset="10463785">The briefness of the interview, the fact that this man was reasonably intelligent, he was advised of his rights, explicitly waived them in writing, he was not a novice to the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.706" offset="10508297">Just one month before, he was involved in a similar interrogation situation since he had been involved in another criminal event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.764" offset="10540585">He knew he could terminate this interrogation at any time, which is a critical safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.513" offset="10559497">He consistently demonstrated his willingness to talk, and it was then not appropriate for the detective to try and persuade him to admit his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.588" offset="10591785">Again, any implied promise of psychological help was only in the context of an anticipated criminal prosecution, and it's... defendant understood that as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.252" offset="10678511">So we would say that under the totality of the circumstances, his confession was a product of his free will and rational mind.</text>
