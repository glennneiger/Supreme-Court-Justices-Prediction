            <text syncTime="55.568" offset="355519">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether an Indian may assert tribal hunting rights as a defense to prosecution for taking wildlife in violation of federal conservation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.244" offset="414242">The focus in this case is on protection of our national symbol, the bald eagle, a majestic but endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.000" offset="445171">Despite extensive federal protection under the Bald Eagle Act and the Endangered Species Act, the eagle remains the frequent object of black market trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.289" offset="482369">In 1980, the Department of Interior initiated a major undercover operation to halt the illegal killing and sale of eagles in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.312" offset="518418">Respondent, a Yankton Sioux Indian, was among those apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.382" offset="538794">At trial, the United States produced extensive evidence that respondent had engaged in a series of eagle transactions over a two-year period in which he had offered to kill, killed, and sold eagles for profit to undercover agents posing as Indian crafts dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="617370">The jury found respondent guilty of killing bald eagles, in violation of the Endangered Species Act, and of selling eagles and other protected birds in violation of the Bald Eagle Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.670" offset="667943">The United States Court of Appeal for the Eighth Circuit sitting en banc partially vacated respondent's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.341" offset="698559">The court concluded that Yankton Sioux Indians have an implied treaty right to hunt eagles for noncommercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.596" offset="727607">The court further concluded that neither the Bald Eagle Act nor the Endangered Species Act demonstrated sufficient Congressional intent to limit that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="772851">The court stated that the United States could retry respondent, but the government would be required to prove that respondent had taken the eagles for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="824051">The United States' position in this case is straightforward.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.926" offset="1016939">The issue that this Court is reviewing is whether or not this affirmative defense in fact exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.029" offset="1041285">We submit that there is in fact no commercial or noncommercial taking defense for Indians in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.843" offset="1116622">We think that the Court of Appeals has foreclosed takings and made them illegal in the other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.430" offset="1142954">Continuing, we submit that Congress does not compromise Indian hunting rights by an act of general prohibition on the taking of wildlife applicable to Indians and non-Indians alike, designed to prevent extinction of the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.606" offset="1203662">In this instance, Congress has given special protection to the nation's severely threatened eagle population through the Bald Eagle Act and the Endangered Species Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.895" offset="1440750">The only difference of any great substance, I think, is that in 668, the provision that permits the Secretary to allow certain limited takings, and he prescribed those by regulation, while in the case of the bald eagle they can only be taken by permit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="379.910" offset="1652864">Stated that it had two purposes for extending protection to the gold eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.064" offset="1673449">One was to prevent the eminent extinction which Congress realized could occur given the large number of takings that were occurring at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.936" offset="1708975">In addition, Congress also noted that the immature bald eagle was indistinguishable from the golden eagle, and for that reason protection was also extended to the golden eagle, to prevent any inadvertent takings of the bald eagles.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.911" offset="1760907">As this time the golden eagle is not listed as an endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.898" offset="1776789">It has not been listed under the Endangered Species Act as an endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.450" offset="1794970">We nevertheless submit that there is a substantial threat to the golden eagle population.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.356" offset="1822660">We submit that there is no real conflict between Indian hunting rights and the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.442" offset="1854947">This conclusion is not only sensible, it is consistent with the Yankton Sioux treaty, the statutory language, and the nation's vital interest in protecting endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.834" offset="1896534">We turn first to the Indian treaty itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.186" offset="1910013">The 1858 treaty with the Yankton Sioux makes no mention whatsoever of specific Indian hunting rights, much less the right to hunt eagles.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.725" offset="1948152">The treaty did not, of course, prohibit the tribe from continuing to hunt game on its reserved lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.046" offset="1973439">However, it did not give them an absolute and unfettered right to take eagles regardless of consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.318" offset="2002487">When the treaty was negotiated, both parties prized eagles, the United States as its national symbol since 1782, and the Indians as a sacred object.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.089" offset="2041566">Neither party recognized that wildlife resources were exhaustable, and neither contemplated how eagles might be allocated if they later became scarce.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.081" offset="2085556">Certainly under these circumstances the government does not surrender through silence its sovereign power and responsibility to protect eagles for future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.020" offset="2125262">Instead, the government retained that right as an exercise of its tribal trust authority and for the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.924" offset="2152952">Likewise, the Yankton Sioux, who considered the capture of an eagle a sacred activity, had no reason to expect that the treaty gave them an absolute right to kill eagles.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.481" offset="2195166">Indeed, unlimited Indian hunting of eagles would destroy the very treaty right they now claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.802" offset="2224423">In short, whatever hunting rights the Yankton Sioux might possess, they do not have an absolute right to conduct hunting activities that threaten the survival of a species that is of great importance to the entire nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.145" offset="2281788">An examination of the Bald Eagle Act and the Endangered Species Act leads to the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.882" offset="2304776">Congress plainly intended that these statutes, framed in terms of universal application, would apply to Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.487" offset="2339153">It is well settled that federal laws of general application generally do apply to Indians, and this principle has been firmly established since the 1930's, prior to enactment of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.862" offset="2384711">Contrary to respondent's arguments, there was no need for Congress expressly to include Indians in the coverage of these Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.587" offset="2427551">These statutes do not abrogate any Indian treaty right.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.389" offset="2442807">Instead, they impose reasonable regulations that are consistent with the preservation of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.609" offset="2463705">Given the migratory nature of eagles, the species can only be preserved and restored to its original numbers if all are subject to the conservation regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.381" offset="2498709">In turn, all will ultimately benefit from the fruits of this conservation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.683" offset="2519920">Thus there is no direct conflict between Indian hunting rights and the federal conservation statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.699" offset="2608005">Both statutes on their face show that Congress considered the special cultural and religious interests of Indians and balanced their needs against the conservation purposes of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.257" offset="2654294">For example, the Bald Eagle Act provides a limited exception, authorizing the Secretary to permit Indians to use eagles for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.362" offset="2694627">The Endangered Species Act also contains a limited exception, authorizing Alaskan natives to take endangered species for subsistence purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.837" offset="2740603">These carefully limited exceptions applicable to particular Indian activity demonstrate that Congress intended these statutes to apply to the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.776" offset="2780309">Moreover, application to the Indians is necessary if the broad conservation goals of these statutes are to be met.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.074" offset="2865468">Surely it is unlikely that Congress would have silently excluded the Indians and their extensive land holdings from the coverage of these Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.084" offset="5025586">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government's position in oral argument and in its briefs in this case appears to be that the Bald Eagle Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act abrogated the right of Dwight Dion as a tribal member to take eagles while on Indian land, while on his reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.399" offset="5110849">In their briefs they seem to say that if it hasn't been shown that that is the case, in other words, that abrogation has not been shown under the principles enunciated by this Court, that there seems to be a limitation, and that is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.075" offset="5169468">Lastly, they argue that unless Indians are prevented from taking eagles for traditional cultural purposes, that will result in extinction of the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.883" offset="5220773">I would like to address those three points here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.101" offset="5233625">But before I begin, I would like to clarify what this case involves and what it does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.739" offset="5256195">Dwight Dion, Sr., was indicted in a multicom indictment in the United States District Court of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.976" offset="5285138">Some of those particular charges dealt with selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.278" offset="5294333">Others, three of them, dealt with taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.646" offset="5311783">The United States District Court... or rather the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that he could not be charged under the Bald Eagle Protection Act or the Endangered Species Act for taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.787" offset="5360371">That is all that they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.306" offset="5366431">They did not hold he could not be prosecuted for selling, or any other Indian could not be prosecuted for selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.460" offset="5391091">As a matter of fact, in this case it held that he could be prosecuted still, further on the three taking counts that are before this Court if the government merely showed, Number One, that he was an Indian, Number Two, it happened on Indian land, and Number Three, that it was for a commercial purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.564" offset="8043460">Right, within the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.185" offset="8057984">In applying the principles for abrogation of treaties to the Acts in this case, the Bald Eagle Protection Act and Endangered Species Act, we start with the Bald Eagle Protection Act that was passed in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.877" offset="8120678">Nobody maintains, including the government, that there was any language in that 1940 enactment that abrogated any particular treaty right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.418" offset="8170938">From 1940 until 1962 that particular Act was not applied against Indians while they were on their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.274" offset="8198314">In 1962, there were some amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.243" offset="8218167">The amendments were to increase the penalties and to include the golden eagle as a part of the particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.349" offset="8246588">Contemporaneous almost with the enactment of that particular statute was the 1962 memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.753" offset="8276263">That was in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.021" offset="8281279">This amendment was passed in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.389" offset="8298729">Where the solicitor of the Department of Interior indicated that the Bald Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Birds Treaty Act did not apply to Indians while they were on their reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.631" offset="8347734">So, it is illogical and certainly would be not really following that if in fact their solicitor was telling them that particular Act could not be applied on the reservation that by those 1962 amendments they thought that the particular law was to be applied or Indian reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.676" offset="8519933">And that came from the District Court decision in White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.480" offset="8543130">There was the permit provision that was included in that 1962 amendment, but as the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals determined, certainly there were other explanations other than that this was to apply to the Indian reservations that could explain that permit provision in that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.108" offset="8613661">The Eighth Circuit said that there were Indians and non-Indians outside of the reservations, that did not live on the reservations, that certainly could and probably would have been involved in Indian religious rites where these particular eagle feathers and parts of eagles could have been used and would have been necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.272" offset="8702268">So, this permit provision does not apply by its terms to Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.343" offset="8726614">It applies to Indians everywhere, whether or not they are on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.980" offset="8745109">Certainly that is a logical explanation, and it would seem according to the respondent that that is not sufficient and not sufficient language to result in an abrogation of his right in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.374" offset="8818670">Now, from 1962 to 1973, the date of the passage of the Endangered Species Act, I was not able to find any reported cases where the Bald Eagle Protection Act was applied to Indians in criminal matters while they were on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.272" offset="8894320">In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was passed, and there were two provisions in that particular Act that the government maintains indicates that it was the intent of Congress to abrogate the right of Indians to take eagles for traditional cultural purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.131" offset="8961716">One of them was the exemption that was set in the Act for Alaskan natives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.268" offset="8982301">However, the Court must keep in mind that two years prior to 1973 Congress had passed the Alaskan Settlement Act, where the rights of natives to hunt and fish had been terminated, had been abrogated in specific language, so it was necessary to put in the Endangered Species Act some protection for the Alaskan natives and the Alaskan Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.401" offset="9078849">Indian tribes in the lower 48 states did not need that particular protection because they had the protection of their reserved rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.756" offset="9116257">In addition, keep in mind that the Alaskan Indians and Alaskan natives were treated much differently than Indian tribes in the lower 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.862" offset="9152619">They weren't treaty tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.397" offset="9158784">Earlier on this Court held that they had no self-governing rights, and there were very few reservations that were in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.653" offset="9195878">And so, a logical explanation for that and the only explanation is that they thought that they needed the protection that the lower 48 state Indian tribes did not need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.246" offset="9254183">The other provision that the government points to to show that there is an exemption or that there is an abrogation in this case was a bill that was enacted in the 92nd Congress, the Congress immediately preceding the one that passed the Endangered Species Act, which was the 93rd Congress, and in that Congress, the 92nd Congress, there were two bills, one that dealt with a specific exemption, in other words, included a specific exemption for Indians from the Act, one which did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.401" offset="9386781">Both of those particular bills died with the 92nd Congress after the 92nd Congress adjourned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.157" offset="9417814">They were not introduced again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.389" offset="9422725">In the 93rd Congress the Endangered Species Act was passed, and so they argue that because these bills had been introduced in a previous Congress and died, that that is some indication that in the 93rd Congress, in its passage of the Endangered Species Act, that that is some intent that it was intended to abrogate the rights of Indians to take wildlife on their reservations for traditional cultural purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.426" offset="9534947">As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held, that they would not sanction that kind of backhanded way of abrogating the treaty right, certainly this Court has held that unsuccessful attempts at legislation are not the best guides of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.286" offset="9598373">Certainly I question whether or not something that happened in the 92nd Congress is proper legislative history for something that subsequently took place in the 93rd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.326" offset="9646542">They also point out in their briefs that there were some remarks of Subcommittee counsel in the 92nd Congress who questioned whether or not the Indians should be given an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.384" offset="9694712">And of course the relevance of that is certainly questionable and of no value to the Court even if it could rise above the principles that remarks of people in opposition to legislation are given little or no weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.144" offset="9753749">I submit to you that when the legislative history in these Acts are locked at, that there is no indication whatsoever of any intent on the part of Congress to abrogate Indian treaty rights, certainly not the kind of evidence, the kind of material that has to be shown under the principle that there has to be a clear expression that Indian rights are going to be abrogated either in the legislative history or either on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.882" offset="9884779">All of the provisions, both of the provisions that the government talks about in support of its position here have logical reasons for being included in this particular bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.106" offset="9929605">The legislative history does not say that we intended by any of the provisions that the government points out here, that we intended to abrogate the right of Indians to hunt while on their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.980" offset="9977148">The government also makes the point in its brief that there really is not an abrogation here, because Indians can secure eagle parts through the permit system under the Bald Eagle Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.125" offset="10053739">First of all, I would submit to you that any time that you have to go through an administrative procedure where that particular individual making the decision as to whether or not you are entitled to something, especially when you have a reserve right to take it in the first place, to have it, is an abrogation and limitation on the right of Indians to take eagles, and it must be so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.044" offset="10161364">In the case of Tulee v. Washington, this Court previously held in discussing an in common right involving fishing rights of Indians in the northwest that to require them to get a state license is an abrogation of their right, and the same principle should apply in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.090" offset="10237537">In addition, under that permit provision, there have been no permits that have been issued to allow Indians to take eagles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.545" offset="10275362">All the eagle or eagle parts that Indians have been able to get have been from the Pocatel Repository in Idaho, and they come in decomposed bags where Indians have to wait a year to a year and a half to get eagles that they need and that they have the right to use in their Indian cultural, religious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.459" offset="10359058">I think it is an understatement and erroneous to say that that limitation and that permit provision is not an abrogation of Indian hunting rights as shown.</text>
