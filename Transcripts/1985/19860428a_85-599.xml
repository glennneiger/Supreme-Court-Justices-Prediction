            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140475">We'll hear arguments next in United States against the American Bar Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.494" offset="166388">Mr. Lauber, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="82.126" stopTime="187.235">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="82.126" offset="468886">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="87.649" offset="491038">These tax refund actions present two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.681" offset="507130">The first is whether the American Bar Endowment, a charitable affiliate of the ABA, is subjected to unrelated business income tax on the profits it derives from running a group insurance program for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.551" offset="570659">The second question is whether the individual respondents, ABA members who acquired insurance from the endowment, are entitled to deduct a portion of their insurance premium as a charitable contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.360" offset="621859">Because Respondents were plaintiffs in a tax refund suit, they of course had the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.546" offset="650594">The Endowment conceded that its insurance activities were regularly carried on, and that those activities were unrelated to the accomplishment of its educational objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.003" offset="696465">In order to avoid income tax on its insurance revenues, therefore, the Endowment was required to prove that the insurance operation was not a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.010" offset="736485">Section 513(c) of the Code defines a trade or business as any activity which is carried on for the production of income from the sale of goods or the performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.679" offset="791133">Respondent agrees that its insurance operation satisfies every element of that definition in the statute, except for one that might be called the "from" test.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.296" offset="837631">The Endowment argued that its $5 million in annual insurance profits are not derived from the insurance goods that it sells or from the insurance services it performs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="187.235" stopTime="191.729">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="187.235" offset="889353">Mr. Lauber, last week we had the all-events test.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.909" offset="900011">This week we have the "from test"?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="191.729" stopTime="223.058">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="191.729" offset="907326">The "from" test.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.290" offset="909624">But that's what they argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.822" offset="923731">they argue that all this money they are making doesn't come from the insurance services that its staff of 40 perform during their working day, but rather, all the money comes from charitable fundraising.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.290" offset="969602">Now, that argument in turn is based on their group gift theory which is the core of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.132" offset="996978">The group gift theory starts from the premise that the Endowment sells insurance only to ABA members and the dependents of ABA members.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="223.058" stopTime="228.374">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="223.058" offset="1032609">Mr. Lauber, if they sold it to the public in general, what difference would it make?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="228.374" stopTime="241.371">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="228.374" offset="1053925">Well, they would then have a harder time making their group gift argument because their group gift argument, which is really the guts of their case, depends on selling only or largely to the organization's own members.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="241.371" stopTime="255.500">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="241.371" offset="1105856">I suspect some arguments can be made the other way, that if the public in general were being solicited, that that would more clearly put them in the business community.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="255.500" stopTime="504.423">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="255.500" offset="1162385">I think they would agree with that, but their argument is because they only sell to members, they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.324" offset="1181716">And they reason that although they charge fair market, competitive prices for their insurance, they set their prices at a level that enables them to make fairly sizeable profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.712" offset="1227273">Now, they argue that their members, acting collectively, have the theoretical power to deprive them of any profits by forcing the Endowment to sell insurance at a lower price, at a price that would only cover its costs and let them make no profit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.262" offset="1297491">So they argue that all the profit they make comes at the sufferance of their members, and therefore, every dollar of profit does not come from the insurance business, but it comes from charitable fundraising in the form of a group gift that the members make by refraining from requiring the Endowment to operate at cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.356" offset="1385889">The Claims Court accepted this group gift argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.298" offset="1397592">It reasoned that the idea of a group profiting from its own members is almost a contradiction in terms, and the Claims Court held as a matter of law that an enterprise that depends on the consent of its members for its profits is not a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.220" offset="1469272">This group gift theory, for which neither the courts below nor Respondent cites any authority or precedent, is wrong for four independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.087" offset="1508769">First of all, the group gift idea is foreclosed by the legislative history of the 1969 law in which Congress enacted its definition of the term trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.757" offset="1559446">The House and Senate report accompanying that law discussed the group insurance activities of several categories of tax exempt groups, like fraternal beneficiary societies, such as the Knights of Columbus or Moose.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.288" offset="1621618">These groups were authorized by the Code to provide insurance to their members and their dependents as part of their tax-exempt mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.450" offset="1658189">That is, for these groups, the provision of insurance to members was a related function.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.495" offset="1678356">Both the House and Senate reports refer to these group insurance activities as a business but note that those groups would be immune from tax on their insurance profits because for them the insurance business was related to their exempt function.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.966" offset="1752335">For example, the House report wrote the bill excludes earnings from businesses related to an organization's exempt function, such as an insurance business run by a fraternal beneficial association for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.577" offset="1814715">Now, these groups, like the Endowment, sold insurance only through their members and the dependents of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.652" offset="1843032">Thus, it was true for them as for the Endowment that the members had the theoretical power to deprive them of any profits at all by making a group gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.569" offset="1878663">But the Congress nevertheless characterized those group insurance activities as a business, and this we think shows that the group gift idea has no place under Section 513(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="446.136" offset="1924952">Secondly, Respondents' group gift theory is foreclosed by three Courts of Appeals decisions that Respondent concedes to be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.602" offset="1962882">The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Circuits have held that another category of tax-exempt group, that is, a professional association organized under Section 501(c)(6) as a business league, does run a trade or business when it provides insurance services and products to its members and their dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.707" offset="2055251">The endowment makes no effort to distinguish its own insurance operation from the insurance operations of the groups in those other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.512" offset="2094434">Respondent agrees, in other words, that its full time staff of 40 people during, their working day provide the... perform the same kinds of promotional, administrative and marketing services and offer the same kinds of insurance products that the groups in these other cases offer.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="532.563" stopTime="569.138">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="532.563" offset="2270708">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.803" offset="2271649">Those groups, those business leagues ran the insurance operation as a service to members, more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.737" offset="2295368">There was one of the cases where the policy dividends came in to the group as an insurance experience rated reserve, and it did not distribute those to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.065" offset="2344687">But the compensations to the group took various forms, either a percentage of premiums or a reserve, experience rated reserve that came to the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.860" offset="2383871">And the Courts held to the extent that the group held on to the money rather than distributing it out to the members, it was taxable on the income.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="569.138" offset="2416994">So here the difference, as I see... maybe this isn't right... from a typical program is that the dividends are all committed as a, they say as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.013" offset="2456491">Of course, that's your second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.235" offset="2461402">But is it not fair to assume that if they didn't have that condition in the policy, that the "earnings", whether you call them earnings or... anyway, the revenues of the Endowment, would be much less?</text>
            <text syncTime="590.280" offset="2501526">I mean, just talking on a straight business basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="593.863" stopTime="664.689">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="593.863" offset="2515842">Well, if they did what the IRS suggested, that they agreed to let the members have their dividends back and asked them voluntarily to donate the dividends back to the Endowment as a gift, the revenues only would be... would be lower only if members declined to make the contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.424" offset="2582088">Now, the Endowment is telling us how generous their members are.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.885" offset="2595985">If that is true, the revenue should not be much lower under that mode of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.810" offset="2615629">But we think the fact that they require them to waive their dividend shows they really don't trust the generosity of their members, and are really running an insurance business, and the money must come to them in the form of insurance revenues, not from charitable contributions because they don't really trust their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.497" offset="2670382">I think that's what the case really comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.439" offset="2682189">In any event, the business leagues involved in these other cases which Respondent agrees to be correct could also have argued that because they only sold insurance to their members and the dependents of their members, that their insurance activity was not a trade or business but was simply a fundraising activity, and that the group was making a group gift to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.925" offset="2768080">However, all three Courts of Appeals held that those business leagues were in the trade or business, and Respondent agrees--</text>

            <text syncTime="695.031" offset="2920531">It wouldn't have been a group gift, it would have been a group business deduction or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.982" offset="2936308">But the same principle would apply, and those courts did not accept that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.445" offset="2950206">It wasn't argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.526" offset="2954490">Thirdly, the group gift idea Respondent suggests would open a loophole in the statute that Congress did not intend and which we think the language of the statute does not support.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.336" offset="3005794">The Endowment's theory would enable any charity to run what would appear for all the world to be a trade or business, what would look and act like a trade or business, yet escape tax on its business profits simply by arranging to do most of its business with its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.757" offset="3075489">For example, a church could run a chain, of ski lodges.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.808" offset="3091685">As long as most of the skiers were members of the church, the church could argue that its members had the theoretical power to deprive it of any profits, that all of its ski lodge income came not from the ski lodge business but from a charitable fundraiser.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.967" offset="3388331">The loophole covers insurance plans, but really doesn't cover anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.079" offset="3400766">Well, it could cover any insurance plan where a, for example, say a university would set up a travel agency which would run Caribbean tours for alumni and faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.815" offset="3443711">They could argue that because all their customers were members that had the power to require it to lower its prices, that it wasn't in the travel agency business.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.383" offset="3477984">But you can imagine a lot of situations where you would have a group with a large membership base who might want certain services, and this group could provide it to the membership and claim it wasn't in a business simply because most of its customers were its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.563" offset="3542663">We think this would open up a potentially large loophole in the statute because many groups do offer services to their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.007" offset="3576413">And the language of the statute, again, to go back to it, defines a trade or business as any activity carried on for the production of income from the sale of goods or the performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.107" offset="3620821">The statute does not refer to the customer base of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.848" offset="3639838">There's nothing to suggest that a given group of activities would be a business in one case because of its customers yet would not be a business in another case because it had a different set of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.065" offset="3684664">Finally, we think Respondent's group gift theory on its own terms doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.231" offset="3717370">The cold fact is that the Endowment requires every insured to waive his claim to any policy dividends as an absolute condition of buying the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.229" offset="3761360">It is simply part of the price of admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.840" offset="3771809">The Claims Court accordingly held correctly, we think, that the individual respondents are not entitled to deduct any portion of their premiums as a charitable contribution because they had failed to prove that they paid more for the insurance than it was worth and that they paid any alleged excess with the intention of benefitting the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.444" offset="3858222">The Claims Court found that each individual Respondent in buying the Endowment's insurance was pursuing only his own economic best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.661" offset="3899077">Given the obvious nongift character of each of these transactions viewed individually, we think it makes no sense that viewed collectively they add up to some kind of group gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.781" offset="4019554">--I think that would make our case even stronger because there... the other side has argued they don't really sell insurance, that the underwriters sell the insurance, all they do is perform services in offering the insurance at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.810" offset="4083711">Now, if they were underwriting, too, it would plainly... they couldn't even argue that they weren't selling insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.353" offset="4105863">But I think it would make no difference, although it would make our case that much stronger if that were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.268" offset="4125507">But the equities of this case have not been as apparent to the lower courts as they are to us, and we think the litigation below showed the government often has a hard time winning cases against charities, particularly where the charities are benefitting legal education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.369" offset="4185902">But I think our position is neither inequitable nor unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.951" offset="4204188">The IRS has made clear to the Endowment that the only thine they would have to do in order to avoid any income tax on their revenues is to agree to let the members have their dividends back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.518" offset="4258522">If the Endowment were to refund the dividends to the members and the member were then voluntarily and individually to donate the money back to the Endowment, it is clear, and the IRS has agreed that the members would then be entitled to a charitable contribution deduction and that that money would come into the hands of the Endowment as charitable receipts, not as business income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.825" offset="4351727">The key question, then, is why doesn't the Endowment do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.606" offset="4366878">If its members are as generous as they say, that should not produce a huge decrease in their revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.251" offset="4401464">The fact that they have refused to do that we think shows that they are not content to rely on charitable fundraising but want to run a business.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis M. Gregory, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1089.048" offset="4496655">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.920" offset="4508148">The American Bar Endowment insurance program is today what it has always been, what it has been advertised to its members to be, and most importantly, for this Court this afternoon, what the Claims Court of the United States found it to be and what the Federal Circuit said the Claims Court was correct in finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.914" offset="4588083">The United States Claims Court found as a fact that the Endowment's insurance plan was a charitable, fundraising effort under which members of the Endowment received insurance but knowingly, voluntarily and acting collectively surrendered to the Endowment for charitable purposes because they wanted to do so approximately the same amount of money that they had spent for insurance over the last 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.194" offset="4721203">In numbers, the Endowment has received $63 million from its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.668" offset="4747117">The Claims Court found that the members intended this program to work as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.352" offset="4769791">Specifically, the Claims Court found... and this goes to the first sentence of Mr. Lauber's argument today... that the dollars we are talking about are not profits from a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.050" offset="4816602">The Claims Court found as fact, and the Federal Circuit re-emphasized it at least three times in its opinion, that the dividends in question do not come from an activity that constitutes the sale of goods or the performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.692" offset="4883162">After reviewing in detail the record over a month's trial, 25 witnesses, 3600 pages of testimony, more than 400-some-odd exhibits, the Claims Court said it was incredulous to find that lawyers would allow their association to exact from them, to force them to pay... and this is the position of the Solicitor General, although we didn't hear it this afternoon... that lawyers would allow their association to take from them unwillingly, and frankly, unwittingly, 100 percent in addition to what they would have had to pay for the very same insurance privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.049" offset="5048570">It's a finding of fact, plain and simple, and we invite the Solicitor General to address that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.241" offset="5073438">The Solicitor General suggests that there are four reasons why the group gift theory of the Endowment, as he puts it, has no relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.540" offset="5118578">Let me respond first by noting that virtually everything attributed to us, both in the brief of the government, in its reply brief, and at the oral argument today, is not our theory, it's not our view; we are simply expressing what the trial court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.182" offset="5193184">The trial court found the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.944" offset="5208230">It found that the dollars do not come from the sale of goods or performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.187" offset="5229128">It specifically found that it was the intention of the members to contribute to the charitable activities of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.954" offset="5260266">Let me quote the Federal Circuit at Appendix 12a to the Petition for Certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.296" offset="5285657">In the present case the Claims Court specifically found that the assignment of dividends was not in exchange for services, but rather reflected the intention of the membership to support the Endowment's charitable activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.050" offset="5424628">I direct your attention to the footnote on 12a which is also quoted in our brief, Justice Rehnquist, at pages... well, the whole footnote and a discussion of it is at pages 21 to 23 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.164" offset="5569033">The quotation, or excuse me, the statement was put into the footnote at this particular point by the Federal Circuit to illustrate, to illustrate precisely that there is no difference between the plan of the Endowment under which members voluntarily contribute dividends and the situation hypothesized by Mr. Lauber whereby the Endowment, if it wanted to run a partially as distinguished from a wholly charitable plan, could have chosen to offer to refund dividends, footnote, would the government be standing by saying we still had a 501(c)(3) exemption, if we did?</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.104" offset="5748860">It's also found in the text, Justice Rehnquist, and if I could read what the Claims Court said which issued the initial findings of fact, this is page 41a of the Claims Court opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.592" offset="5802777">"It is quite obvious, then, that this money was not earned from the sale of goods or the performance of services, but for some other reason. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.799" offset="5835587">"That reason was the intent of the members to support the Endowment's charitable activities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.012" offset="5856485">In the text of the Federal Circuit opinion, the Court said that the Claims Court properly found facts and specifically found that the dollars in question do not come from the sale of goods or the performance of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.259" offset="5909461">I would suggest, Justice Rehnquist, that the two opinions below cannot be read in any manner other than as we have suggested to the Court that there was a specific finding of fact after looking at all of the evidence that the members did not pay for an exchange of services, either administrative services by the Endowment or for any form of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.706" offset="5999218">They didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.026" offset="6004547">The reason is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.478" offset="6010294">The members controlled the Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.190" offset="6021161">The government has suggested time and again in its briefs and at oral argument that the Endowment has exacted or taken these dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.534" offset="6058568">That is not the finding of the Claims Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.316" offset="6069644">The Claims Court said, and if you would indulge me, I'd like to quote from pages 38a and 39a,</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.972" offset="6104335">"The final and most telling factor is that the insurance program was operated with the approval and consent of the ABA membership. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.409" offset="6142055">Continuing a bit later in the quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.540" offset="6150624">"Most professional associations, including almost all bar associations, operate such programs on a service-oriented basis and secure the most economical group insurance for their members. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.999" offset="6200465">"If the ABA had chosen to do this, it could have offered its members insurance at premiums lower than any other bar association, perhaps the lowest premiums of any group in the country. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.666" offset="6247068">"The ABA members, however, have chosen a more generous approach, allowing the Endowment, rather than the ABA, to operate the insurance program and retain the dividends. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.774" offset="6295551">Now, the government from the beginning of this case, has taken the position and has offered the factual proposition that the members of the Endowment did not control the Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.391" offset="6337974">We tried that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.743" offset="6343407">Numerous witnesses testified to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.954" offset="6360230">The Court considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.206" offset="6365246">The Court made a specific finding of fact with respect to membership control over this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.298" offset="6385621">Again I would respectfully direct the Court's attention to pages 39a and 40a, also from the Claims Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.714" offset="6423237">I should also note that you find in the appendix of the Petition for Certiorari only the written opinion of the Claims Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.948" offset="6452181">In our brief in response to the petition we noted that on two prior occasions the Claims Court had entered substantial and lengthy findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.317" offset="6489693">You will find them at the end of Volume 2 of the Joint Appendix, and we urge that they be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.958" offset="6512263">In the Claims Court opinion the Court said</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.121" offset="6524906">"Defendant suggests that ABA/ABE members have no control over the way the insurance programs are operated because the programs are maintained in their present form by an unresponsive leadership. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.799" offset="6575584">"The court finds to the contrary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.701" offset="6587182">"In the first place, there is nothing to suggest that ABA/ABE leadership is unresponsive to the wishes of the members they represent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.897" offset="6623962">Later in the same paragraph the Court said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.450" offset="6638173">"Plaintiff has demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that there are ample, effective channels within the ABA for members to make their views known and have them implemented. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.457" offset="6682268">I'd like to pause for just a moment to talk about the economics of this program, and to do so by way of illustration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.047" offset="7524560">Because the members were well-informed, because the members controlled the Endowment, it is my finding that the Endowment has not received dividends because of the rendition of services or the sale of insurance; it's received them because of the charitable intentions of the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.190" offset="7593210">Let me turn to service, insurance, charitable contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.642" offset="7610973">All that the Endowment has done for 30 years is the very same activity group, other association group insurance plans have done either alone, as a group or in concert with third party administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.920" offset="7668129">Again, the record... and I keep going back to the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.817" offset="7699685">We had a collision at sea, and findings were entered after that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.480" offset="7718388">The value of the services rendered by the Endowment in this case were miniscule in comparison to the dividends received, approximately five to seven times in dividends what the record discloses the value of the services is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.222" offset="7785262">Indeed, the concededly deductible expenses of the Endowment exceeded the value of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.215" offset="7813265">I don't believe there's any question about that on the record as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.778" offset="7827580">Turning to group insurance, what the member received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.560" offset="7846702">The member received professional association group insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.154" offset="7869063">Professional association group insurance is available to the members of the Bar at net cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.459" offset="7894245">Net cost is premiums, less dividends, plus the attributable expenses of the Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.764" offset="7923502">Again, I don't believe there's any dispute that the members of the Bar at any time they chose... and they control the Endowment, as found by the Court... could have chosen to have insurance for everything they paid except the dividends that went to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.464" offset="7982330">They could have taken the dividends, returned it to their pockets, tax-free both to themselves and to the Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.409" offset="8010019">The government in looking at the charitable contribution... and to some extent we think this was the error of Judge Kozinski in the charitable contribution issue... forgets that this record discloses three people who protested this plan in the form that it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.360" offset="8093820">Two testified at trial that they understood that it was a charitable program but they would have preferred that it be run at a cheaper price as a service to members because they didn't want to give up the dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.547" offset="8138646">One person was referred to in the record who crossed out the dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.402" offset="8158082">It was not caught at the Endowment office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.603" offset="8166859">The dividend was refunded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.536" offset="8174591">But the finding of fact is that the overwhelming majority of the members, with surprisingly little dissent, and I believe Chief Judge Kozinski said a handful of members only, objected to this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.904" offset="8228090">The government won't come to grips with the fact that this is a finding of fact, that the vast majority of the members wanted this program to work precisely as it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.495" offset="8598402">If you look at the regulations under Section 61, fair market value is the price at which a willing buyer and a willing seller, each having knowledge of the relevant facts and neither under a compulsion to buy or sell, will consummate a transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.617" offset="9162855">The Claims Court did not disagree with us as to what this group could have received insurance for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.271" offset="9185530">It said, however, and the Federal Circuit concluded that it did so erroneously, that in order to show charitable motivation, you have to show that you bypassed a cheaper, more economical insurance product in order to participate in the charitable plan of the Endowment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.234" offset="9269331">The federal Circuit reviewed that because we said it was error.</text>
