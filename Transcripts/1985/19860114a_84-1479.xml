            <text syncTime="12.120" offset="196930">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.777" offset="199647">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.464" offset="210304">As this Court is well aware, perhaps nothing tears more at the fabric of federal-state relations in the criminal law area that federal habeas corpus review of state criminal convictions, and it is a case such as the present one that helps make clear why that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.924" offset="284179">More that 15 years ago, on July 4th, 1970, Respondent Wilson and two unapprehended accomplices murdered a fellow by the name of Sam Reiner during the course of a robbery of a taxi garage in the Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.544" offset="338722">The accuracy, the reliability, the validity of that state jury verdict convicting him of that crime has never really been open to question, because there's no question that we're dealing with a guilty man.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.445" offset="386265">Innocence is not part of this case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.849" offset="403924">Since 1972 when the case did proceed to the state court trial, the defendant has been litigating a Sixth Amendment claim that has had nothing to do with the accuracy or integrity of the truth-finding process at his state court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.343" offset="473828">The issue related to the manner in which manifestly reliable and voluntary admissions were obtained from him from a jailhouse informant, one Benny Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.307" offset="521684">And I say he's been litigating it since 1972, and litigate it he certainly has been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.663" offset="551150">He had the opportunity to litigate this issue in the state court at a pretrial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.974" offset="572362">He litigated it at trial in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.690" offset="587304">He litigated his Sixth Amendment issue without success in the state appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.017" offset="604544">When that was unavailing, he moved into the federal courts, pursuing federal habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.702" offset="627323">He had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue before a district court, which found that the statements were not obtained improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.073" offset="656789">Proceeding on to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, they too found that there was no impropriety in the manner in which the statements were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.304" offset="701720">Then this Court decided United States v. Henry in 1980 and the Petitioner, or I should say the Respondent before this Court, Wilson, started all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.159" offset="745083">He went back into federal court, commencing a new habeas corpus action, claiming then, which is contrary to the argument he makes now, that Henry established a new rule of law entitled to retroactive application in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.339" offset="809867">He lost in the district court because the district court found, as we argued, that Henry really didn't change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.978" offset="844453">It found that he'd really had an ample bite at the apple the first time around, and it also gave appropriate recognition and paid due deference to some very important factual findings that emanated from not only the state court, but from the federal courts during the first habeas corpus application, and that important factual finding is that the statements, the incriminating statements that he made to the jailhouse informant, were spontaneous, were completely unsolicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.653" offset="963153">He did then, in about 1982 or 1984, move on to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, a second panel of that court, which for the first time found a constitutional error, where no other court found it to exist, and I point out, it was not a unanimous court, it was a split panel of that court that said: Yes, the Sixth Amendment was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.393" offset="1046118">And so in 1974 the people of New York State were told, you're back to square one.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.734" offset="1071405">You mean 1984?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_r_kartagener" startTime="231.875" stopTime="567.052">
            <label>Mr. Steven R. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="231.875" offset="1076002">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.110" offset="1076943">I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.516" offset="1078615">1984, 14 years after the murder, you're back to square one.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.467" offset="1098363">All that went before you is of no moment, because we are also going to disregard the factual findings of spontaneity that were made by all the courts that went before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.917" offset="1132218">All that went before is of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.854" offset="1139950">You retry this man, 14 years after the crime, or let him free.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.210" offset="1161371">And I suggest that when one looks at the history of this case and the manner in which the writ of habeas corpus was used here, one can understand why there is this terrible friction that results between federal and state relations because of habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.548" offset="1222706">And this Court has seen instances in which it's been argued that a Petitioner has abused the writ, and that's a term of art, abuse of the wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.733" offset="1263457">And in fact we're really not dealing with an abuse of the writ case as that term of art is generally used in the law, but there is an abuse of the writ here, not by the Petitioner so much as by the Court of Appeals, the manner in which it employed the writ to grant relief so long after the fact, on the same ground that had previously determined on the merits and rejected by all the courts that went before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.237" offset="1361469">I would like at this point to make very clear that I do not wish to come before this Court and suggest that the federal writ of habeas corpus is unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.842" offset="1415908">We recognize that it is a very important protection and clearly, other than in Fourth Amendment litigation, where a state prisoner does generally not have the right to come into federal court of a federal habeas corpus application, in the other areas of constitutional law we do not dispute that where a constitutional issue affects, may affect the validity of a state criminal conviction, a state prisoner should have one full and fair opportunity to come into federal court and have the federal court examine that constitutional issue before a conclusive presumption of finality attaches to that state court criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.995" offset="1588525">What we are asking the Court to reject in this case is the suggestion by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that the habeas corpus really is is a never ending merry go round ride, available to state habeas... excuse me, state prisoners, who will have the opportunity, based on the most recent advance sheet or the most recent slip opinion that adds a nuance on wrinkle or further dimension to an issue of constitutional law that they previously litigated and lost on, to come right back into the federal courts, start that merry go round ride all over again, with the hope that they'll get lucky this time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.730" offset="1743379">We think that the rule followed by the Court of Appeals in this case allows for that conclusion, and we do believe that that rule, seemingly founded on this Court's 22 year old decision in United States v. Sanders, is an erroneous one if it's applied today.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.331" offset="1829792">And I say that because if you look at the Court of Appeals, the 1984 decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, they view their obligation in this case to be one in which they would have to give, have to give, some consideration to the repetitive, successive, identical claim under the Sanders analysis, unless it could be shown that there had been a previous merits determination and the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.848" offset="1967927">That's the old Sanders test.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.192" offset="1973256">And what has gone largely unnoticed, it seems, in the law for many years is that is 1955 the Sanders analysis was made wholly inapplicable to state prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.904" offset="2024143">Sanders is largely a case of statutory construction as applied to repetitive, successive claim situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.058" offset="2056744">I'm not talking about abuse of the writ situations, where the defendant comes to court with a new claim which he has previously withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.805" offset="2083702">And Sanders addresses both aspects of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.991" offset="2100420">But insofar as it addresses repetitive, successive claim situations, which was governed at the time in 1963 by 28 U.S. Code 2244, which was then applicable to both state and federal prisoners, and did have this ends of justice language and a strong presumption of consideration of a successive claim, in 1966 Congress changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.886" offset="2204074">It said, as to state prisoners, you're out of 2244, which is now 2244-called ends of justice before you ca and (c), and the pertinent provision for this Court's consideration with respect to this case is 2244(b), which now tells the federal judiciary: You're no longer hampered by that hurdle of giving consideration to the so-called ends of justice before you can give controlling, conclusive weight to a previous determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.201" offset="2333328">The law under 2244(b) is that you need not consider a subsequent, successive, repetitive petition unless it raises a new ground, and only if it is found that the Petitioner has not improperly withheld that ground the first time around or somehow abused the writ.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="567.052" offset="2416711">But it's cast, isn't it, Mr. Kartagener, in terms of the thing may he, the writ may be dismissed, not that the writ must be dismissed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_r_kartagener" startTime="575.830" stopTime="614.206">
            <label>Mr. Steven R. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="575.830" offset="2451820">Well, Justice Rehnquist, what it says is the court need not entertain the successive petition unless.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.779" offset="2487660">And I would agree with you that it does not contain the type of mandatory language that we would prefer to see, you shall not, you can not.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.729" offset="2523395">But we suggest that the whole purpose of that statute, when read in accord with the Congressional intent, which is shown in the Senate report that accompanies it, was to have that statute interpreted as one in which there would ordinarily be, rather than a presumption of let's consider the repeated claim, the presumption should be you don't consider the repeated claim.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="614.206" stopTime="629.964">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="614.206" offset="2605315">But even if Sanders by virtue of the rules and the advisory notes still governed, I would think that you could use the term "ends of justice" for your purpose as much as your opponent could.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_r_kartagener" startTime="629.964" stopTime="887.578">
            <label>Mr. Steven R. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="629.964" offset="2668322">I would certainly agree with that position, Your Honor, and in our brief we argue as a final subsection that, even if the ends of justice analysis were to be considered extant, notwithstanding the Congressional mandatory legislation of 1966, we should still prevail under that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.862" offset="2743973">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="649.565" offset="2746794">Because in 1966, aside from all of the important concerns that the Court has so recently articulated in the area of habeas corpus... the need for finality, the need for a conclusion in state criminal litigation, the important need to have the state criminal trial be the main bout and not just the preliminary bout in a long line of knock-down, drag-out fights in the federal courts on constitutional issues... there is a very important other reason why that end of justice argument would support us.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.520" offset="2890572">And that is because there was a strong suggestion in the amendatory legislation of 1966 that... and this is in the Senate report, which we cite at length in our brief... that the purpose of the amendment in 1966 was to bring a greater degree of finality to state habeas corpus applications, and indeed a qualified application of the doctrine of res judicata, which as this Court is well aware until that time was essentially missing, almost in its entirety, from habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.600" offset="3018886">And I would suggest that we're not really asking for res judicata principles to be applied under our rule in this case, not in the strictest sense, because res judicata, if strictly applied, would say that if you have brought one habeas corpus application and you left out a claim and you come back into court later with a new claim, under pure res judicata principles that claim would be barred as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.856" offset="3111882">That's really not what we're arguing about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.214" offset="3121390">What we're suggesting to the Court and what we're asking the Court to do in exercising its supervisory capacity over the lower federal courts, just as the Court did in Sanders in interpreting Section 2244 as it then existed, what we're asking the Court to do is, consistent with the amendment of 2244 making it 2244(b), consistent with that Congressional intent, consistent with all of the important concerns that the Court has articulated about the need to bring finality to habeas corpus litigation, we're asking for a rule not really of res judicata effect, but really a qualified rule of issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.339" offset="3281887">And it's a rather simple rule, we suggest, and a rather fair rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.229" offset="3293380">We ask the Court to interpret the general procedure to be that once a state prisoner has had one full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits of a constitutional claim in the state courts, and once he's had an additional full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits of his constitutional claim in the federal courts, then generally that should be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.187" offset="3393273">But recognizing, Justice Rehnquist, your noting that the language of 2244(b) is less than absolutely mandatory, and recognizing that you may need some limited room for an exercise of discretion, consistent with the need for finality, we suggest that there are two areas where you might allow a repetition of a claim previously heard and rejected on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.928" offset="3492224">And I think it's a very important two exceptions, a very important qualification, because I think one of the things that would certainly bother the Court in a habeas corpus situation is if we're dealing with a claim that really raised some shadow of a doubt as to the innocence of the state prisoner, or some claim that truly goes to the accuracy, integrity, or validity of the factfinding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.668" offset="3587206">And what we suggest as the exceptions is the appropriate suggestions are two in which you have... well, excuse me... the first one being if there are new-found facts alleged, new facts that would be outcome determinative, facts that nobody was aware of the first time, facts which suggest... perhaps that a confession that was previously found to be acceptable, suddenly we find out newly that the police beat it out of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.657" offset="3695144">That type--</text>

            <text syncTime="892.249" offset="3717504">--Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.655" offset="3719072">We quote from that article in our reply brief, I believe in our main brief as well, and I suggest that the title of that article really makes a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.136" offset="3757002">Innocence should not be irrelevant, as Judge Friendly has suggested and many other legal scholars have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.397" offset="3790125">But we take into consideration the need for some flexibility by saying, where there are new-found facts, number one, which will go to the issue possibly of guilt or innocence or the validity of a confession, to make sure that it wasn't beaten out of him by the police, or if you have a new rule of law that would be found to be retroactively applicable on habeas corpus, the Petitioner should get the benefit as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.043" offset="3892629">And as this Court is well aware, the most common rule to be given retroactive analysis in a collateral proceeding would be one that goes to the very integrity or accuracy of the factfinding process.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.172" offset="4005165">2254(d) told the federal courts to give deference to that finding, and until the Second Circuit's most recent opinion the lower courts did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.496" offset="4042468">And that is a very important point when we discuss the merits as to why this case really, as we've argued all along, has nothing to do with Henry or Maine v. Moulton.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.790" offset="4079666">I draw the Court's attention to Justice Powell's concurring decision in Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.270" offset="4113625">I draw attention as well to the Chief Justice's concurrence, and of course the Chief Justice was the author of Henry, his concurrence is Snead v. Stringer, which Justice Rehnquist wrote, which was a dissent from the denial of certiorari, where there has been, I suggest, some uniformity of agreement that spontaneous, truly spontaneous statements, fall outside of the pale of Sixth Amendment concern, if they really are spontaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.010" offset="4220518">And we suggest in this case that one of the critical errors of the lower, of the Court of Appeals, is that they paid no deferences to those factual findings of spontaneity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.927" offset="4264195">And we further argue that the record really does support that factual finding, that these statements were spontaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.487" offset="4290422">Unlike Henry, there was a factfinding hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.188" offset="4305260">In Henry there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.672" offset="4315186">The jailhouse informant, Benny Lee, testified, and he was absolutely credited, that there was never any asking of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.403" offset="4350086">He made it very clear that there was no attempt to inveigle or solicit information from this Respondent Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.822" offset="4383836">His sole job, the job given him by the detective that he spoke with, was to keep his ears open, not to obtain incriminating information about Wilson, but really to try to identify the two other participants in the robbery, who were responsible for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.049" offset="4452695">And I point out to this day they still go unapprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.687" offset="4467219">The importance of this rule that we argue in terms of issue preclusion blends with the merits of this case, because we think that one of the evils that you see where there is going to be constant, repetitive consideration of the same claim time and time again is that there will end up... you will end up with new factual findings, new factual inferences being drawn by the most recent courts if they disagree for their own reasons with other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.517" offset="4614549">And that shouldn't be the rule of law in a sane and rational system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.828" offset="4627820">Historical facts shouldn't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.655" offset="4635134">They don't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.733" offset="4639418">The law can change, but historical facts don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.154" offset="4649135">And the Second Circuit, in deciding that it would consider this matter on the merits, really ignored the fact that they should not have been ignoring so blithely the factual findings of spontaneity that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.742" offset="4707441">What we are asking this Court to do in positing this rule of qualified issue preclusion is really to breathe life into the Congressional intent when it enacted 2244(b), and we also ask the Court to announce a rule that will bring habeas corpus litigation involving successive, repetitive claims into accord with the general concerns that this Court has in bringing a greater degree of finality to habeas corpus litigation, which can be traced back to Justice Powell's opinion in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, before that, if we were to go back further, perhaps Justice Harlan's dissent in Sanders, but echoed in Wainwright v. Sykes and Engle v. Isaac and Barefoot v. Estelle, that state court proceedings are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.830" offset="4907852">They should not be that first bout, as I made mention of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.939" offset="4920287">And I would like to suggest as well that it really doesn't matter that courts will not regularly and routinely grant relief under the type of circumstances that the Second Circuit did in this case the second time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.245" offset="4985488">And I would concede that you probably do not have a lot of reported decisions where either district courts or circuit courts of appeal on a successive, repetitive claim have granted the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.179" offset="5029165">But the real evil is not in the case in which it happens to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.958" offset="5044316">True, you have that miscarriage of justice here because an effective retrial of this fellow has been rendered virtually impossible due to the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.376" offset="5082037">But the real sin of the Second Circuit's rule and the rule that Respondent would have you accept in this case, that there can be a repetitious consideration of state criminal convictions, the evil of that is the potential that a court can take the case in the so-called ends of justice, whatever that amorphous term might mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.461" offset="5166360">And it is that possibility which holds out a beacon to disgruntled state prisoners, always looking at those advance sheets, trying to get back into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.271" offset="5201573">And I think that the better position should be that, once you have assured that one full and fair bite at the apple in state court, that second full and fair bite at the apple in federal court, that the defendant, that the state defendant, should not have the right really in effect to devour the entire apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.448" offset="5286314">That would be silly, and that's what they're asking to have the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.761" offset="5299584">And I suggest that if this Petitioner had lost in the Second Circuit... excuse me: I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.602" offset="5322886">This habeas Petitioner, who is now the Respondent, had he lost in the Second Circuit on his Henry claim, by his analysis perhaps he'd be able to bounce into court once again on a claim that, well, maybe Moulton really makes clear finally that he is right and everybody else has been wrong all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.030" offset="5404597">I just don't think that that's what habeas corpus is about, that every time a new decision comes down the race should start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.558" offset="5438765">I know Respondent comes before this Court suggesting, well, but here there was really plain error in view of Henry, and I think we've dealt with that on the merits and shown why Henry has not been violated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.522" offset="5486621">But they'll come and say, but it was plain error, there's really a differential basis here as to why this Court should have been allowed to consider the successive, repetitive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.565" offset="5522775">I don't think that argument holds water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.486" offset="5538448">Most good lawyers can find in a new decision some basis for suggesting that an older decision really may not have been as correct as the court that rendered it at a given point in time thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.074" offset="5588812">Put the finality concepts are just so important and the search for absolute justice or absolute correctness in judicial decisions, ultimate truth in judicial decisions, it's just too elusive to warrant the endless perpetuation of habeas corpus litigation on the possibility, as I say, that eventually you'll strike it lucky with some sympathetic federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.985" offset="5692466">In the end, we do think, and we've chronicled at length in our brief the statutory and Congressional intent basis for our argument, we think we've also supported out contentions for limiting the older Sanders rule as applied to repetitive, successive claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.759" offset="5779506">And by the way, I point out that we're not arguing that Sanders has been undercut in the abuse of the writ area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.053" offset="5812734">Justice O'Connor is Rose v. Lundy makes note that Sanders is applicable in dealing with abuse of the writ, because at the time it came down there was no statute that governed and the subsequent statutes that were enacted, the rules that were enacted, really abide by the Sanders analysis in dealing with "abuse of the writ" situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.246" offset="5889534">But we're not talking about that here, and insofar as it applies to... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.136" offset="5909073">Insofar as we're dealing with a successive, repetitive, same ground type claim, we think that we have shown the statutory basis, the Congressional intent basis, the purposes of this Court in dealing with habeas corpus litigation, the purpose of bringing finality, reasonable finality, to habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.816" offset="5987754">We think we justify the rule that we urge upon the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.392" offset="6002069">Therefore, I would like only briefly to move on to our contention that this was really much ado about nothing in some respects, because, contrary to the arguments made by Respondent, this is not a case in which the state is coming into court and saying, don't look at the merits, go with the procedural arguments that we're talking about, because if you do look at the merits the state has to lose under Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.850" offset="6103947">That's just not clear and it's not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.913" offset="6112202">What you had here, and we think it's just so critical, are very important factual findings of spontaneity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.909" offset="6144175">As I've already indicated, the lower court, the state court, found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.940" offset="6156296">The district court the first time found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.719" offset="6171343">The Second Circuit certainly the first time gave recognition of the doctrine that spontaneous statements are outside of the Sixth Amendment concerns of Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.902" offset="6208123">The district court the second time around gave also appropriate respect to those findings of spontaneity, and it was just the Second Circuit that chose willy-nilly to disregard them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.805" offset="6247725">We think that for there to be a violation of Henry what you need is some form of... excuse me, a violation of the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Henry and other decisions of the Court... you have to have some form of deliberate elicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.126" offset="6320972">Now, what that is... I'm not suggesting that is interrogation, which is an argument that's been put to the Court before in Brewer or in perhaps Maine v. Moulton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.526" offset="6366634">What I am saying is that it can be... excuse me, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.228" offset="6389413">I see that my time--</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.749" offset="6507487">The facts of this case show a glaring violation of Wilson's constitutional right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.996" offset="6532460">He was placed in a holding cell with a secret informant after his right to counsel had attached.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1602.057" offset="6556701">What about the finding of the trial court that these were spontaneous statements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.804" offset="6571748">You say they're clearly erroneous?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Philip S. Weber</label>
            <text syncTime="1608.616" offset="6582928">Your Honor, we haven't argued that that is a clearly erroneous finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.739" offset="6599438">What we believe is that the state court found a mixed conclusion of law and fact that the statements were voluntary and unsolicited and spontaneous, and that the federal court on a habeas petition could re-examine that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.233" offset="6665475">But what's more important, perhaps, is that a finding of spontaneity or voluntariness of unsolicitedness perhaps, if you will, does not answer the inquiry that Henry requires of the federal court on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.944" offset="6728273">What's required of the federal court on habeas corpus in this context is that the court ask whether the statement was deliberately elicited from the accused in the absence of his counsel by the conduct of the state, in which the state created a situation that is likely to induce the accused to make his statement to the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.765" offset="6815522">Here that was exactly what was done, and these facts are legally indistinguishable from those of United States against Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.058" offset="6848750">In Henry, as in the present case, the state deliberately elicited the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.555" offset="6870693">Under Henry it does not matter whether the questions were asked by the informant or whether the informant interrogated Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.208" offset="6905279">That has all gone by the boards and it is now clear, although it was not after Brewer, that interrogation or questioning is not an essential element of a violation of the right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.139" offset="6965047">Accordingly, if Wilson's case were tried in 1985 there could be no doubt that his testimony would not be admissible at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.839" offset="7003813">The decision of the court below should be affirmed because, in the light of Henry, that evidence was erroneously admitted in 1970 at Wilson's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.319" offset="7049789">My argument today will consist of two points: First, it was entirely appropriate for the Court of Appeals and the district court to entertain Wilson's current petition in light of United States against Henry, which was an intervening authority with direct and substantial bearing on Wilson's constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.545" offset="7138709">Second, in correctly entertaining Wilson's current application, the court below complied with Section 2254(d) by giving due regard to the finding of fact that the state trial court made when it determined Wilson's motion to suppress Lee's testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.258" offset="7501498">With regard to the first point, Section 2244(b) does not provide a basis for the federal courts to foreclose Wilson's habeas corpus petition, because the statute is purely permissive, and, second, because under the circumstances of this case, the court below correctly exercised its discretion to entertain the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.138" offset="7593031">As to the permissive nature of Section 2244(b), it only authorizes a federal court to decline to entertain a successive habeas corpus petition it it so chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.774" offset="7643604">The statute does not command the court to dismiss the petition under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.163" offset="7669100">Under Section 2244(b), the court may refuse to entertain a successive petition in two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.863" offset="7699924">First, it may refuse to entertain the petition if it is persuaded that there is no new grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.844" offset="7719882">Second, if a new ground is asserted, it may dismiss the petition if the prisoner deliberately withheld the new ground or otherwise abused the writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.606" offset="8674918">The ends of justice language in Sanders and in the old Section 2244 never served as a means by which the federal court could entertain a petition which it was not otherwise entitled to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.867" offset="8727999">Contrary to the Petitioner's argument, the ends of justice language in Sanders did not provide a loophole for the courts to use to entertain petitions that otherwise they did not have jurisdiction to entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.048" offset="8788708">Indeed, Section 2254(a) of Title 28 provides that the court shall entertain an application of a prisoner who alleges that his confinement is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.611" offset="8946905">This Court should now reject the state's argument that dismissal should be mandatory because, as the Court recognized in Sanders, the considerations governing each case must be weighed individually.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.271" offset="9053589">However, the Court of Appeals by deciding that the ends of justice would be served simply foreclosed the option of not entertaining the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.793" offset="9923676">It's not a new ground within the meaning of Sanders, because Sanders defined the ground to mean the sufficient legal basis on which the petition is brought, so that a claim of unconstitutionality under the Sixth Amendment for a violation of the right to the assistance of counsel is a ground, and therefore most likely this petition does not assert a new ground, although in Sanders the Court said that when there is a question about that is should be interpreted favorably to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.468" offset="10046347">But coming back to the main thought, here we have something new under the sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.746" offset="10075500">There is a case, an intervening authority with a direct and substantial bearing on Wilson's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.276" offset="10101622">It lends support to his claim, and all that Wilson is asking for is for an opportunity to present that claim to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.602" offset="10130879">By entertaining the petition, it does not mean that the petition will be favorably decided for the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.944" offset="10156270">It means that the court will consider the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.911" offset="10164107">It means that it will not be summarily dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.801" offset="10175705">It means that the Petitioner will have a hearing before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.548" offset="10190647">That is all that the ends of justice requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.625" offset="10206948">If the federal courts refuse today to hear Wilson's petition merely because he had previously attempted to obtain relief, it would be to penalize him for asserting his right too soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.215" offset="10253341">Today we have the benefit of a new precedent with a direct and substantial bearing on his constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.414" offset="10282180">The federal courts that considered Wilson's first petition did not have the benefit of Henry, and neither did the state court that originally determined his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.084" offset="10312796">The federal courts that considered his petition the first time assumed that the state of the law was such that interrogation or behavior tantamount to interrogation was necessary in order to find a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.139" offset="10377057">It would be unjust to refuse to re-examine Wilson's claim today as it stood before Henry, when Henry lends this support, as even the Petitioner agrees, to Wilson's claim of unconstitutional confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.540" offset="10434631">I should now like to turn to my second argument, which is that the Court below treated the state trial court's finding of fact with due deference under Section 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.097" offset="10480920">In the course of entertaining Wilson's current petition, the Court of Appeals accepted the state court's finding that the informant did not interrogate Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.859" offset="10519895">This was the finding of fact that the state trial court relied on when it determined Wilson's motion to suppress Lee's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.277" offset="10553645">This is evident from the finding of the state court which is in the joint appendix and which the statute specifically requires that the federal habeas court defer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.368" offset="10593978">In other words, it is the written finding in the record and not the full record which comprises the facts that the state trial court found and to which deference is deserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.847" offset="10647895">The state court amply discussed the basis for its holding in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.407" offset="10670151">Section 2254(d) makes it clear that deference is due to these findings of fact, and the findings of fact here and the ones that the state court considered determinative were the findings of no interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.572" offset="10722814">The court below accepted this finding and so it did not violate Section 2254(d), even though it did reach the opposite legal conclusion from the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.631" offset="10767013">The state urges this Court to engage in speculation concerning the cause of Wilson's inculpatory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.456" offset="10798360">It asks this Court to suppose that Wilson's statement was caused by a visit from his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.140" offset="10829080">In doing so, the state goes beyond the record to which deference is due for its facts, because the state court never mentioned the visit from Wilson's brother even once in the course of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.150" offset="10885087">But more importantly, this argument of the state shows a misunderstanding of the Henry decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.711" offset="10911313">This Court held in Henry that the correct inquiry is whether the state deliberately elicited a confession by creating a situation that was likely to induce the accused to speak to the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.097" offset="10960842">This is not a subjective inquiry and it does not require an inquiry into the state of mind of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.657" offset="10987173">If in fact the state deliberately set out to elicit a damaging statement from the accused by using a stratagem that was likely to succeed and did obtain such a statement, then the Henry test has been satisfied and the right to counsel has been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.868" offset="11815986">The case here is that the informant provoked Wilson by making comments, by engaging him in conversation, and that's all that's necessary under the holding of Henry in order to find a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.734" offset="11907415">The court merely looked to the facts and drew a different legal conclusion from those of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.404" offset="11926118">Its conclusion rested on a different legal standard that the state court's, and is informed, as the state court's was not, by United States against Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.979" offset="11960391">Accordingly, there are two particular reasons why the Court of Appeals did not violate the presumption of Section 2254(d) when it rendered its decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.740" offset="11999470">First, it did not make factual findings "considerably at odds" with those of the state court, as the Court of Appeals had in Sumner against Mata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.017" offset="12040535">Sumner against Mata was quite a different case from this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.531" offset="12054641">There the issue was whether the facts adequately supported the prisoner's contention that the pretrial identification procedure used there violated his right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.028" offset="12096646">There the Court of Appeals applied the same legal standard as the state court and arrived at a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.134" offset="12120992">Here the Court of Appeals applied a different legal standard to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.040" offset="12136665">The inquiry conducted was whether the state deliberately elicited the statement from the accused by creating a situation likely to induce him to make such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.847" offset="12175849">It thus differed from the state court not on the facts, but on the correct legal standard, and on this it was entitled to disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.265" offset="12205524">The second reason why the court below did not err, even though it did not cite Section 2254(d), is that when it disagreed with the state's conclusion, it disagreed with a conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.822" offset="12263829">This Court has consistently held that Congress 2254(d) does not restrict the power of the federal court on habeas corpus to reach its own conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.224" offset="12313358">The state apparently concedes that deliberate elicitation is a mixed question of law and fact, beyond the presumption of Section 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.063" offset="12348780">Given this, the Court of Appeals was entitled to reach its own conclusion about whether the Henry test was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.983" offset="12376469">This is especially so since the state court and the federal courts on the first petition did not have the Henry decision to guide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.651" offset="12407085">Nevertheless, the state argues that the Court of Appeals should have adhered to the state court's conclusion that the confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.070" offset="12444806">And here, Your Honor, I submit that the state court's determination, which is a mixed conclusion of law and fact, that the statement was spontaneous or unsolicited or voluntary are all in pari materia, they are all pointed in the same direction and have the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.297" offset="12521710">Indeed, the trial court's decision really only had one finding of fact, and that was no interrogation, and that is the one that the state trial court considered determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.384" offset="12578030">The latter, the voluntariness issue, is a mixed question of finding of fact, mixed question of law and fact, pardon me, and as to voluntariness this Court has recently held in Miller against Fenton that it is a mixed question and it is not subject to the strictures of 2254(d).</text>
