            <label>Mr. Robert A. Harper, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="80.063" offset="458181">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.034" offset="462151">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the prosecutor's closing argument in the Willie Jasper Darden prosecution during the final summary has been variously described as bad, as unfair, as harmful, as prejudicial, as egregious, but there is one word only that is sufficient to describe this argument in this case, and that is reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.422" offset="571657">The question then arises as to why the case hasn't been reversed and why is it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.327" offset="591301">And the simple answer is, the Eleventh Circuit has not and did not apply the appropriate standard announced in Caldwell versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.732" offset="628917">On the same date that the Darden case came down en banc from the Eleventh Circuit, July the 23rd, 1985, that court decided Tucker versus Kemp, Brooks v. Kemp, and William Tucker versus Kemp.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.932" offset="681684">The Tucker case has been vacated and remanded under the Caldwell decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.294" offset="703105">We raised Caldwell in the petition for rehearing which was denied... that opinion is found in the joint appendix at 395... when less than a majority of the court voted in favor of the petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.382" offset="759529">The Eleventh Circuit is squarely faced and apparently rejected the Caldwell standard, and we would submit that in view of the dissents, two dissents in the en banc opinion on the 27th of August, that a remand would be inaccurate, and that an outright reversal is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.578" offset="840300">This argument is so bad it has been universally condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.010" offset="858063">It is so bad, as the District Judge noted, even the state has not even weakly asserted anything but that it is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.865" offset="893381">The reviewing courts, each and every one, starting with the Supreme Court of Florida, found that the prosecutor's remarks under ordinary circumstances would constitute a violation of the code of professional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.354" offset="947402">Two Justices of the Florida Supreme Court, former Chief Justices each, described the remarks, as vituperative personal remarks upon the accused and appeals to passions and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.215" offset="1002782">The magistrate who heard the evidence at the evidentiary hearing below was</text>
            <text syncTime="221.067" offset="1022217">"convinced that the jury deliberation was substantially influenced by the prejudicial argument. "</text>
            <text syncTime="226.770" offset="1045100">The Eleventh... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.000" offset="1053982">The United States District Judge who had a de novo hearing on the issue said no one even weakly suggested that the prosecutors' closing remarks were anything but improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.088" offset="1094315">The Eleventh Circuit said that anyone attempting a textbook illustration of a violation of the code of professional responsibility could not possibly improve upon the example provided by the prosecution during Darden's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.386" offset="1147500">We submit that this case would be universally applauded by the organized bar, and no concept should be indulged to deflect from the fact that the sentencer in this capital case was diverted from his truthfinding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.157" offset="1210612">The purpose of the Code of Professional Responsibility is universally accepted by every practicing attorney and judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.132" offset="1238511">The purpose of the rules is to protect the due process rights to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.166" offset="1262648">These standards are objective, and we submit that these standards are the litmus against which this prosecutor's argument should be tested, and we submit that this test in the search for the ever elusive concept called justice would require that this trial, these proceedings be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.379" offset="1339448">Against this test, every reviewing court, all the parties in the litigation concede that the argument is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.563" offset="1372257">The only problem is, the standard appropriate in this instance has not been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.619" offset="1396499">The argument itself comprises 44 pages in which 27 improper arguments are interjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.965" offset="1445818">There are ten attacks on the credibility of the criminal justice system itself, attacks on the Department of Corrections, attacks on the parole people for turning this man loose, and the like, nine instances of personal opinion, two instances of bolstering the argument, two outright misstatements, one interjection of race, and one attack on specific... well, actually two attacks on specific rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.034" offset="1562115">In the order that they occur, the arguments start off with entreaties to the effect,</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Prospect</label>
            <text syncTime="1094.958" offset="4517818">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, with regards to the first remarks that Mr. Harper made, I would like to relate to the Court historically that nine years ago when we argued this case another lawyer appeared on behalf of Mr. Darden and gave essentially the same attack on the statements of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.662" offset="4600574">Nothing obviously has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.334" offset="4607262">The remarks have remained the same for the past 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.805" offset="4621159">The attacks have remained the same, and judicial treatments and considerations of the propriety of those remarks have likewise remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.491" offset="4655954">The only thing that has changed between nine years ago and now is the federal hearing we had in 1979 in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.476" offset="4691898">Nine years ago I stood here and told you that although the remarks were indeed improper and no thinking person could ever hope to defend them either singularly or collectively, there was something that I thought was very compelling about the case, and that was the lack of objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.478" offset="4759921">There was no objection to the particular alleged inflammatory remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.203" offset="4790746">At that time, I knew only that there was no objection, but by virtue of the federal hearing, I know why, and the Court knows now why there was no such objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.810" offset="4829198">The lead defense counsel for Mr. Darden, Mr. Goodwill, testified at the federal hearing which, if I may digress for a moment, the federal hearing was held for the sole purpose of determining the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.823" offset="4901296">As a major premise of that challenge, the defense intended to develop the reason for failure to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.538" offset="4944137">It was their legal position that the failure to object to these arguments represented and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.394" offset="4979559">Now, obviously, Mr. Goodwill had to testify that there was no objection, but he gave as his reason the fact that apparently he and the prosecutor were old friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.784" offset="5033057">They had gone to law school together, and they had known each other approximately 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.877" offset="5053433">When I asked him directly why there was no objection, he stated that because of his prior acquaintance with the prosecutor and by having cases against him and knowing him as a lawyer, he was confident that his remarks, if left unchecked, would rise to a level which would represent reversible error without the need of objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.832" offset="5149250">Now, this question that I asked of the gentleman was specifically responsive to the testimony presented on behalf of the defense at the federal hearing from the other lawyer, the junior attorney who was newly admitted to the bar who was assisting Mr. Goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.232" offset="5206928">His name was Maloney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.213" offset="5214870">Mr. Maloney said the reason there was no objection was because he didn't know anything that the prosecutor was saying was objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.468" offset="5243813">Mr. Goodwill contradicted that, and specifically added that at one point in the closing argument Mr. Maloney arose as if to object and he physically restrained him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.116" offset="5290416">Now, this was sworn testimony before a federal magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.998" offset="5309955">In this particular regard, even the magistrate, the one person who Mr. Darden relied so heavily upon, made a finding of fact after hearing testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.516" offset="5356035">He rejected obviously Mr. Maloney's testimony and accepted as a finding of historical fact that the lack of objection was due to deliberate tactical choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.861" offset="5401384">Now, for the past few minutes we have obviously heard complaints about the arguments, and we have heard the requests that because of the arguments alone the conviction should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.725" offset="5648920">And obviously Mr. Darden wants this to be the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.457" offset="5667833">But in answer to Justice Rehnquist's question about that, I think the standard has been developed, at least in the federal context, in United States versus Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.015" offset="5706076">Now, there the remarks weren't hardly as bad, but the concept and the standard that was applied was whether viewing the remarks alone could a determination be made that the jury was unable to properly weigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.753" offset="5765008">Now, for a moment we brush aside the fact that there was no objection, and that there was no objection for a deliberate reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.218" offset="5798863">Even without that consideration momentarily the remarks were really more the product of somebody who perhaps got carried away to the point of forgetting his professional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.259" offset="5859049">As I point out in my brief, the defense counsel made a very skilful closing argument in which he pointed out the fact of Mr. McDaniels parading around the courtroom and slapping paper on the table, and apparently he was doing something else that wasn't demonstrated, at least not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.649" offset="5932610">He mentioned to the jury that Mr. McDaniel never argues the evidence or talks about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.596" offset="5964375">He wants to embarrass you into a verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.911" offset="6177639">Just a line, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.334" offset="6183281">The claim today is different in that we now have the Caldwell Eighth Amendment ramification introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.097" offset="6222360">Although it hasn't been stated, I guess what the position is that this argument carried over to the sentencing phase of trial such that the recommendation and thus the ultimate sentence was not reliable in terms of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.952" offset="6301773">Now, I will just mention that the defense counsel followed that argument with a lengthy closing argument, as long or longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.538" offset="6336150">At the close of that argument, the judge instructed the jury in a capital case in a first degree murder, the instructions of which are very long and involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.584" offset="6388290">At that point in time, the jury retired for, as the record reflects, two hours and ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.921" offset="6417652">After they returned with their verdicts, they were polled individually three times, once for each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.936" offset="6445760">At that time, brief closing remarks were made by defense and prosecution during the penalty phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.000" offset="6482017">Nothing has ever been claimed here or before that the remarks of the prosecutor during penalty phase were improper in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.637" offset="6512528">In fact, they are very brief, and if I may sum up, the prosecutor asked the jury to listen and remember the evidence that was presented at trial, and I am sure you will find after listening to the judge's instructions that Mr. Darden falls into the aggravating circumstances and doesn't fall into any of the mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.428" offset="6591732">At that point, the record shows that the jury deliberated for an additional 40 minutes and returned a recommendation of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.353" offset="6623392">If we add all that up, we are looking at approximately four-and-a-half to five hours when the recommendation of death came after the argument which the defense maintains necessarily infected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.894" offset="6685564">I think that is a factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.207" offset="6698834">No court has ever held that the arguments alone under the circumstances of this case have infected the determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.003" offset="6738017">Now, I submit that if that is true, then I don't see how the carryover effect could be had to the recommendation, which was only a recommendation, mind you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.229" offset="6778873">If I could get back to the fact of the lack of objection, I think that is really the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.945" offset="6813773">Was that choice permissible in a capital case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.020" offset="6834044">As I have stated in my brief, I think that decisions of counsel obviously can bind any defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.966" offset="6869884">Decisions of counsel can obviously define... I am sorry... bind a capital defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.970" offset="6901857">But will those decisions, even though deliberate, will they allow a capital defendant to be... to suffer any adverse or prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.246" offset="6946997">And that is what I think the crux of this case is on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.640" offset="6964551">And I have offered the standard of reasonableness, borrowing from Strickland versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.844" offset="6993391">Did Mr. Goodwill's decision not to object, did it represent a reasonable decision under the circumstances and facts of that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.692" offset="7032783">Now, I would like to remind the Court again that this case was indeed the first case in Polk County, Florida, in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.565" offset="7064235">Everyone involved was relatively, if not totally, new at proceeding under our capital statute at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.700" offset="7096731">If you accept the premise that Goodwill offered under oath that the prosecutor would go indeed to the point of reversible error, you have got to examine what possible effect he expected or hoped for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.162" offset="7154618">He didn't get a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.343" offset="7163395">That is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.822" offset="7169247">So he wasn't successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.755" offset="7176979">But nevertheless was he reasonable in anticipating at that time the proposition that if he allowed the prosecutor to go on, could he possibly embarrass the jury out of a verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.122" offset="7230478">He turned everything the prosecutor said skillfully around, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.687" offset="7248764">I think at that point in time, not using the benefit of hindsight and result-oriented thinking, I think it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.265" offset="7283036">He had made other tactical choices during the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.745" offset="7296933">One, which I mentioned in the brief, regarded alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.508" offset="7311980">Mr. Darden at all times wanted to present a defensive alibi, and based on their investigation, the lawyers assigned to the case could not account for his whereabouts between approximately 5:30 and 6:30... 6:00 o'clock, I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.308" offset="7371226">That period of time was a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.441" offset="7387735">The decision was made not to go with a strong alibi defense in terms of a formal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.396" offset="7419604">The decision as revealed in the federal hearing was to let Mr. Darden take the stand, provide evidence of his alibi up to a point, and let the state provide evidence from that point after, in other words, before the gap and after the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.507" offset="7488045">That turned out, we learned again in the federal hearing, to be a proper choice, because the prosecutor told the defense lawyer later, after the trial, that he was just hoping an alibi defense would have been presented because he was fully prepared in rebuttal to come in and show that from where Mr. Darden said he was at a given point, there was ample time driving the routes necessary to have gotten to the furniture store, committed the crime, headed out of town on State Road... or US 92, and had the accident, which was never disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.578" offset="7612284">That was a good choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.789" offset="7621165">Again, the choice about failing to object, while not good, was still reasonable, and I think even though this is a capital case, and I am not standing here saying that we can always provide procedural bars in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.249" offset="7674977">This is a serious business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.130" offset="7682501">I think, to borrow language from the Court in other decisions, perhaps capital defendants are entitled to as much protection as possible, but I nevertheless think in the circumstances of this case it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.547" offset="7728163">The evidence that was presented was strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.310" offset="7743209">I think the jury was intelligent enough to know that the prosecutor was simply being outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.573" offset="7764316">There is no showing that they were infected or affected by what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.176" offset="7786677">The evidence was ample.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.497" offset="7795977">They could have and obviously did return their verdict based only on that evidence, and I think the petitioner here, the defendant has failed to show other than the claim how or why there is even the possibility that they were affected by the closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.199" offset="7858775">I think he needs to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.430" offset="7867657">I posited that position in my brief, and I think if anything is written in that regard it should be that if you are going to make that claim under facts and circumstances like this case, there should be some burden shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.400" offset="7923559">I think there has been none offered and obviously none shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.411" offset="7939650">Regarding the Witherspoon issue, I cheerfully admit that the question of Caldwell was raised in the third petition for rehearing seeking the fourth en banc hearing of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.875" offset="8017495">I also note that two of the dissenters mentioned that the issue, the Eighth Amendment issue of closing argument ought to be considered in light of Caldwell versus Mississippi as well as the series of cases that the Court had come out with about the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.535" offset="8084160">I don't believe, however, that the views of the dissenters are equivalent to a holding on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.432" offset="8115715">I don't really think the Eleventh Circuit has ever addressed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.352" offset="8127418">But as against the possibility that some could consider they had, I would like to say that this is not Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.818" offset="8157198">I don't need to remind the Court what was involved there, but I will briefly emphasize that in Caldwell that which lessened the reliability of the sentence were remarks made by the prosecutor to the jury who was the sentencer, unlike Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.728" offset="8224907">This jury in Mississippi did the actual sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.620" offset="8236401">The remarks were of the tenor that, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you don't really need to worry about what you are going to do, because this case is going to be reviewed by higher authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.626" offset="8280496">An objection was made, unlike here, and the trial judge reinforced that statement when he repeated to the effect, ladies and gentlemen, that is true, there will be further review of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.848" offset="8337338">Now, for the very, I think, compelling and adequate reasons expressed in the decision, that could have left the jury with the possibility that they could have shirked their responsibility with the idea that someone after them would take care of sentencing this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.497" offset="8404003">Thus the reliability was lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.680" offset="8416646">We don't have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.540" offset="8424169">We have got improper remarks, but we don't have misstatements of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.764" offset="8440992">We have nothing going to the jury which indicated they could do anything but what they had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.585" offset="8456352">At that point it was guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.617" offset="8468473">We don't have the trial judge reinforcing what the prosecutor said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.803" offset="8497208">I realize that the rather loose claim has been made that the trial judge told the jury to listen carefully to the closing arguments, that these lawyers were trained, and that they should pay close attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.369" offset="8539422">But I don't think that hardly rises to the same level as the statements of the trial judge in the Mississippi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.182" offset="8562723">The last issue which has not been argued by Mr. Harper yet, if at all, regards the ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.641" offset="9464574">To the pool, the entire pool, and two things I would like to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.426" offset="9483696">In the beginning, the trial judge explained to the entire people before 12 were selected to go into the box for individual examination, he specifically told them in language which even the defense doesn't complain about that they were all going to be asked questions regarding capital punishment, so they at least knew that something was coming in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.032" offset="9582125">Now, Mr. Harper faults the Eleventh Circuit as well as the District Court, the conclusion of both courts that presumably or obviously Mr. Murphy heard all questions going before the one asked of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.681" offset="9644715">Now, there is record support, a gentleman by the name of Mulroy... I believe it is on Page 89 of the trial transcript... was called in after peremptory excusal, and the first thing asked of him was, could you hear the questions we have been asking all the jurors?</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.633" offset="9708453">And he says, yes, I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.002" offset="9713991">Now, it would be obviously better if the same question was asked of Murphy, but it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.696" offset="9736770">But I think the presumption or the logical inference can be that the circumstances of the questioning of the jurors was such that all prospective jurors, and I am talking about those before they were called into the box for individual examination not only heard the questions asked of those, they observed the people who answered in the specific way those five who were excused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.977" offset="10173851">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.898" offset="10177613">No experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.371" offset="10183464">But all courts below have consistently held that he understood the concept of Witherspoon perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.064" offset="10206243">I might note that the question that he asked goes only to the first part of Footnote 21 in Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.498" offset="10243964">He never got to the guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.181" offset="10250651">He went right to sentence, those two concepts which were merged in Witt and, according to the opinion simplified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.375" offset="10275520">Now, if I may borrow somewhat from the preceding argument, I think that it must be remembered that the objection raised here, and I think rather prophetic in light of the argument before us, the defense filed a pretrial motion contending that the state not be allowed to ask Witherspoon type questions, contending that such questions were irrelevant to a determination of guilt or innocence, but that if the court would allow those questions and if a positive response were asked, that challenges for cause not be allowed, without articulating it any more than that, and I practically stated it verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.622" offset="10440509">The position of the defense in '73 in light of our new statute was that now that we have a bifurcated trial, anything that the state might want to know regarding predisposition to Witherspoon has nothing to do with guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.231" offset="10498919">That was the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.552" offset="10508218">It was denied, and a continuing objection was lodged throughout the entire examination, but nothing was renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.868" offset="10537475">And I think that is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.027" offset="10542073">No juror excused was made the object of a statement, motion, or objection that the individual was impartial, there was no objection, or request, perhaps more importantly, there was no request that the trial court continue questioning and see if the juror, whichever juror had given a response regarding opposition to capital punishment, to see if additional questioning could be had to determine rehabilitation on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.089" offset="10658370">In that regard, I think that the precise issue is not really raised in terms of the Grigsby concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.052" offset="10686164">The excusal, I think, was proper standing by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.005" offset="10709988">The right question was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.787" offset="10721168">I don't know what the wrong standard is that they are continually harping on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.041" offset="10738096">But I submit that it was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.372" offset="10747500">Now, if I could return to the last phase, I only want to say since my time is running out that... and if I may, it will be by way of conclusion, this case in addition to being as old as it is is rather eerie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.331" offset="10811343">We have a murder occurring in September of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.945" offset="10829733">Mr. Darden was arrested that evening and was immediately appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.779" offset="10853139">The record indicates both directly and I think you can draw logical inferences therefrom that the entire staff of a public defender's office in Polk County, Florida was devoted to this first capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.859" offset="10913430">If anyone suffered, I think, in that four-month period I think it was the other criminal defendants in that county who for all the record suggests were getting no attention to their particular cases whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.457" offset="10959823">The case is prophetic in that the lawyers 13 years ago decided that Witherspoon did not apply to a bifurcated trial by filing their motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.696" offset="11008724">I think that was innovative and brilliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.175" offset="11022622">We have a situation where a trial judge in what can only be considered a prophetic vein told the jury that at the second phase of the proceedings they were only going to recommend sentence, and that he was going to give that recommendation, however, great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.600" offset="11100362">The great weight concept to our recommendation in Florida was embraced in Tedder versus State, and that wasn't decided until two or three years after this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.636" offset="11136515">The trial judge told the defendant, told the jury, and told the defendant's lawyers after reading the statutory mitigating items in our statute, said that no one was limited to these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.695" offset="11196702">Anything in mitigation, anything relevant was coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.636" offset="11212480">The parameters of Lockett were character and record of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.481" offset="11231915">Here he asked for history, family causes, reputation, anything pertinent to the proper sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.188" offset="11270680">The lawyers again perhaps being able to see in the future asked questions of the individual jurors relating to race, what they felt about statistics showing the number of convictions and arrests for blacks versus whites, something which I believe was argued last month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.260" offset="11347062">It is surprising, I think, that the amount of due process afforded to this individual has nevertheless resulted in this delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.666" offset="11384679">I am not here to ask for speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.379" offset="11399516">I am here only to ask for looking at this case in the context of what it was as it was tried 13 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.864" offset="11437446">We can't judge either the performance of counsel or the performance of the judge by standards which have evolved at this point in time, even though I might add I don't think the judge could have improved one bit between now and then.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.846" offset="12797381">They in footnotes site Jones v. State, but they don't say we are applying a procedural bar, and indeed they can, but because counsel didn't object, it triggered a rule in Florida that this case would have to be reviewed under a fundamental error standard, under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.739" offset="12864881">It is reviewable without objection, and it had to be reviewed by the Supreme Court under the death penalty statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.845" offset="13097371">And I would submit that the trial judge himself enunciating that objection into the record is all that is necessary.</text>
