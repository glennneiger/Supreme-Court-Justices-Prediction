            <text syncTime="1564.233" offset="6407395">One of the most important differences that I would like to emphasize at the outset is that the immunity provision as provided by the Illinois Supreme Court in this very case is coextensive with the privilege against self-incrimination which the respondent to a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.261" offset="6475522">There is no question that the respondent to a sexually dangerous persons proceeding has the ability to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege in any proceeding, but there is also no question that in this case the Illinois Supreme Court has immunized that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.069" offset="6526722">Nothing that Terry Allen said to any psychiatrist at any point in time can ever be used against him in any criminal prosecution for the underlying sex offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.108" offset="6562876">The Illinois Supreme Court has made that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.477" offset="6572384">And this is coextensive with the Fifth Amendment privilege, and this Court has recognized that repeatedly, that transactional immunity is not what the Fifth Amendment requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.355" offset="6647930">That is certainly true, Justice Rehnquist, and I think that leads us to the second major fundamental distinction between the parties, and that is the position of the state of Illinois that this is a civil statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.563" offset="6684711">It is a civil statute because the legislature that drafted it and enacted it said it was civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.598" offset="6704877">It is a civil statute because the Supreme Court of Illinois, which has had the opportunity to evaluate it, has concluded it to be civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.454" offset="6732358">And it is a civil statute because in its effect and in its purpose it does what a civil statute is designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.358" offset="6759944">Now, I admit that it does it in the context of due process safeguards which are often found in criminal cases, but we point out in our brief how ironic it is that the state of Illinois provides more due process safeguards to a civil proceeding and the result is that people therefore identify it as a criminal prosecution, and I think that that is the ironic result that is proffered to the Court this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.698" offset="11521335">If the State of Illinois wants to punish Terry Allen, we have the weaponry to use in a criminal prosecution to far more severely sanction him for his conduct, and if you're talking about the deterrent effect, if you look at DSM 3 or any psychiatric manual, you will find that the psychosexually disordered are impulsive personalities, and the idea that we're going to deter an impulsive sex offender is inherently illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.181" offset="11627183">This could not have been the intent of the legislature of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.300" offset="11643692">The legislature showed its intent in 1955 when they amended the Sexually Dangerous Persons statute and they said that if you proceed as a county prosecutor against a person as a sexually dangerous person and he receives treatment from the psychiatrists and is discharged from custody as a sexually dangerous person, you may not proceed on the underlying indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.898" offset="11734076">They couldn't have been more clear in saying that the Sexually Dangerous Persons statute provides a treatment alternative to criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.688" offset="11773259">If we want to punish and deter people like Terry Allen, we send thousands of people for sex offenses to the prisons every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.627" offset="11808995">But for those 30 or so people we send to the Menard Psychiatric Institute for treatment, we have the right to provide that treatment in a civil context, and the fact that we erect procedural safeguards around that civil procedure does not mean that it shall be labeled for Fifth Amendment purposes a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.217" offset="11951310">I don't believe that Gault is a particularly helpful case in this context, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that I think that Gault involved a juvenile statute, and the language of the Court involved quite clearly indicates that it considered the actual effect of the statute involved on the juvenile to be indistinguishable from a criminal effect that a person would suffer, and in Gault, for example, it was noted that an adult convicted of the same offense would have received a petty fine whereas the juvenile was subjected to incarceration until he reached the age of majority under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.123" offset="12086938">So the Court was concerned that the apparent intent of the statute was to punish criminals, and I think that Gault is very much like Specht and some of the cases in the Petitioner's brief where a conviction is obtained, and then there are benignly labeled treatments given contingent upon conviction as alternatives to sentencing, and if we required Terry Allen to be convicted of a sex offense before we offered this treatment, perhaps the issue in analysis would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.392" offset="12204071">But I think here the fact that Illinois not only doesn't proceed on the criminal prosecution but actually quashes the underlying charge removes this from the ambit--</text>
