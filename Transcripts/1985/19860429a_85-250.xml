            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="167751">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government defends the constitutionality of Section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act, which provides that parents and children or siblings who live together shall be treated as a single household for food stamp entitlement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.631" offset="227415">This case is here on the government's direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.452" offset="254687">The District Court ruled that Section 3(i) violates equal protection principles by discriminating against families and by impermissibly burdening family decisions to live together.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.075" offset="297214">After briefly describing the food stamp program and the facts of this case, I will explain why the District Court's decision should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.347" offset="330233">The Food Stamp Act establishes a social welfare program funded by the Department of Agriculture and administered by state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.353" offset="366282">It supplements the food purchasing power of low income households.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.840" offset="384254">Under this program state agencies distribute food stamps to needy households on the basis of standard allotments that take into account household size.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.862" offset="424378">The food stamp program has grown rapidly since its creation in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.450" offset="442664">It is now the nation's second most costly needs-based public assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.920" offset="464607">In 1983, program outlays were over $11 billion, providing assistance to over 21 million program participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.960" offset="504731">The huge cost and dramatic growth of the food stamp program have produced public concern over reports of widespread waste and fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.332" offset="542243">In 1981 and again in 1982 Congress amended the Food Stamp Act to improve program efficiency and to curtail certain types of frequently encountered recipient abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.556" offset="591144">Congress gave particular attention to the Food Stamp Act's definition of the term "household".</text>
            <text syncTime="123.110" offset="613296">Prior to 1981, persons who lived together but purchased and prepared their meals separately could claim separate household status, and thereby receive higher per capita benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.168" offset="661570">As a result families frequently mischaracterized their members as separate households to obtain additional food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.857" offset="696365">Congress in response amended the household definition to provide that parents and children or siblings who live together shall be treated as one household for food stamp entitlement purposes regardless of their actual meal purchase and preparation habits.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.800" offset="760104">Congress also provided a special exception, permitting elderly and disabled parents and siblings to qualify as a separate household if they in fact did separately prepare their meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.460" offset="814752">These amendments to the household definition were specifically designed to assure the nation's limited welfare resources were efficiently distributed to those in greatest need.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.101" offset="861250">Appellee Natividad Castillo and his family challenged the constitutionality of the revised household definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.338" offset="890194">They claimed that the new definition violated equal protection principles by denying certain family members the opportunity to claim separate household status.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.793" offset="928019">The District Court consolidated their action with three other suits raising similar equal protection claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.363" offset="954351">The District Court ultimately held that the household definition is unconstitutional, and enjoined its application against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.403" offset="990504">The court acknowledged that Section 3(i)'s treatment of family members had a rational basis, therefore it meets the generally applicable equal protection requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.842" offset="1028225">The court concluded, however, that family-based classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.079" offset="1053198">It then held without further analysis that Section 3(i) violated the appellees' Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="240.083" stopTime="245.052">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="240.083" offset="1081201">Is there anything in the record, Mr. Minear, which shows the difference in cost between the two programs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="245.052" stopTime="484.640">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="245.052" offset="1101054">It is not clear from the record, but it is clear from the regulations themselves, and the regulations provide, for instance, that an eight-member household would receive 75 percent of the benefits that would be given to eight separate households, and that two four-member households receive 110 percent of the benefits of the eight-member household.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.704" offset="1207738">We submit that the District Court erred in concluding that Section 3(i) violates equal protection principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.958" offset="1232711">Instead, Section 3(i)'s household definition represents a rational legislative intent to improve the efficiency of the food stamp program by adopting standards that as a general matter direct the nation's limited welfare resources to those with the greatest need.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.550" offset="1299062">We note first, as the District Court agreed, that Section 3(i)'s household definition meets the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.473" offset="1330827">Congress enacted the revised household definition in response to serious public concern over the size, effectiveness, and integrity of the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.012" offset="1368966">The 1981 and 1982 Congressional hearings revealed that from 11 to 20 percent of food stamp benefits were issued in error, amounting to a program loss of from $1 to $2 billion per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.171" offset="1421524">Those hearings also revealed that the practice of family members falsely claiming separate household status was one of the most serious forms of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.710" offset="1463738">Finally, the hearings revealed that in light of the large number of families that participate in the food stamp program, there is no effective and efficient means for verifying family household status.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.018" offset="1512953">Congress therefore elected to redefine the term "household" as a workable solution to this serious and costly problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.022" offset="1540956">The refined definition represents the rational Congressional judgment based on thorough investigation and deliberation that food stamp abuses can be reduced and benefits preserved for those most in need by treating family members who live together as a single household.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.916" offset="1616502">Furthermore, this definition is carefully tailored to provide special relief for elderly and disabled parents and siblings, those family members that Congress determined were most in need of special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.476" offset="1666762">In short, Section 3(i)'s revised "household" definition represents the type of reasonable classification that is routinely employed in social welfare programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.599" offset="1703333">The revised definition plainly withstands rational basis scrutiny, the type of scrutiny this Court applies to these types of classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.538" offset="1739069">Indeed, the District Court as well as all other courts that considered this issue agree that the "household" definition meets the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.876" offset="1776372">The District Court went astray in applying heightened scrutiny to the Food Stamp Act's "household" definition because plainly family members, the class affected by the "household definition", do not represent a suspect or quasi-suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.153" offset="1837498">Furthermore, the "household" definition does not result in any constitutionally significant limitation on individual choice in family matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.426" offset="1874592">Heightened scrutiny has been applied to laws affecting family-based decision only when the government's action directly and substantially interferes with important family choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.716" offset="1915761">Here, the household definition does not prevent any group of persons, related or unrelated, from living together, and if they live together, from dining apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.338" offset="1954213">It simply allocates food stamp benefits to families in light of the cooperative arrangements that families generally employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.594" offset="1987232">The revised definition may provide financial incentive for closely related family members who live together to purchase and prepare their meals together as well, but it neither compels nor prohibits any family-based decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.319" offset="2038119">Family members retain the full range of choice in structuring their living and meal preparation habits.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.113" offset="2109381">As far as they were designed to prevent fraud, is it rational to assume that families are more likely to defraud the government than unrelated individuals?</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="509.604" stopTime="554.364">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="509.604" offset="2159327">I think it is clear that families are better situation in fact to falsely claim separate household status, and it also seems that family members are more likely to purchase and prepare their meals together.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.495" offset="2214916">In terms of actual intent, are family members more likely to create fraud?</text>
            <text syncTime="527.380" offset="2230380">I don't think you can really draw that inference, but I do think it is true that they are best situation in fact to conduct fraudulent activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.902" offset="2264548">It is also true that family members are the largest component of the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.104" offset="2281267">They represent almost three-quarters of food stamp participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.241" offset="2297880">Therefore by eliminating this potential for abuse from family members, we have significantly reduced the potential possibility for fraud in the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.415" offset="2562553">Congress has considered that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.181" offset="2569658">That has been suggested by the various federal and state food stamp administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.319" offset="2586168">But Congress at present is content to retain the special exception for elderly and disabled persons and also for unrelated persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.941" offset="2632666">The "household" definition's impact on family living arrangements is no different from that of a broad variety of other legislative provisions that consider family status in allocating public burdens and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.748" offset="2679895">In sum, the revised definition of the term "household" represents a permissible classification designed to promote the efficiency and preserve the integrity of the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.556" offset="2723154">Appellees defend the District Court's decision on two additional grounds not relied upon by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.044" offset="2745097">Appellees first contend that the "household" definition creates an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.031" offset="2769025">That contention is mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.383" offset="2778429">The "household" definition creates a legitimate legislative classification like that upheld in Weinberger versus Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.454" offset="2802671">As in Salfi, that provides for distribution of benefits based on objective criteria that Congress has determined relevant to its legitimate welfare policy roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.742" offset="2843840">Appellees also contend that food stamp recipients have a special right to increased benefits because of the importance of a health diet.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.248" offset="2873828">This contention, not raised below, is also mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.800" offset="2888039">Appellees do not have an inherent, fundamental right to federal food purchasing assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.354" offset="2906324">Congress may impose limitations on food stamp benefits as on other forms of social welfare benefits, to promote efficiency and to prevent abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.460" offset="2942687">At bottom, appellees urge this Court to declare the Food Stamp Act "household" definition unconstitutional on public policy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.898" offset="2976437">However, as this Court has repeatedly stated, the judgement of Congress on questions of social welfare policy is entitled to special deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.736" offset="3007784">Courts do not sit to pass on policy or the wisdom of the course that Congress has chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.706" offset="3027742">In this case, Congress has determined that the refined definition of "household" is necessary to reduce serious fraud in the food stamp program, and to preserve the nation's limited benefits for those with greatest need.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.364" offset="3074344">We submit that the judgment of Congress on this quintessential legislative question should be respected, and we therefore urge this Court to reverse the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.970" offset="3112796">If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.537" offset="3223033">--Seven USC 2012(i), the family rule, unconstitutionally interferes with the appellees' family choices of... family choices of living together.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.345" offset="3274233">Not only does it interfere with the right to live together.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.897" offset="3288444">The harm caused the appellees outweighs the state's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.384" offset="3310387">The District Court found that the family rule, the food stamp family rule put families at a distinct disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.256" offset="3353959">Unrelated individuals could obtain separate household status simply by purchasing and preparing food separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.047" offset="3393038">Families, no matter what, could never go in and show that it was impossible for them to prepare food together and show that they could not possibly function as a single economic unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.021" offset="3448940">The only exception was for elderly and for disabled parents and siblings.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.358" offset="3474331">The appellees are eight families, eight guest families and eight host families that live together.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.046" offset="3513097">There are more than 30 children involved with these families.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.184" offset="3533577">All of the appellees have children, young children of their own to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.236" offset="3553848">All but one of them had maintained a separate household before economic necessity forced them to move in with their relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.210" offset="3597733">There was no question that they were eligible for food stamps as a separate household but for the family... Natividad Castillo and his wife and eight children were migrant workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.969" offset="3656770">They went up north to Michigan to work in seasonal labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.771" offset="3675996">When they returned home, they had no income, they had no assets but one old car.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.860" offset="3704313">They had to move in with Mrs. Castillo's daughter from a previous marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.764" offset="3727928">Theresa Barrera was receiving food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.633" offset="3739422">She had two children of her own, and was receiving welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.518" offset="3758961">The food stamp office denied the Castillo family's application for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.172" offset="3785606">Not only did they deny the application for food stamps, they refused to supplement Mrs. Barrera's food stamp allotment for that first month, so the Castillo family would have been left without any food stamps that first month.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.448" offset="3850703">After that they would have received a reduced amount based on both households' income, which in this case was Theresa Barrera's welfare income, even though Ms. Barrera's income was not available to the Castillos.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.345" offset="3934295">A similar thing happened to the Cody family, also migrant workers, also went up to Michigan, and went home and had no income.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.367" offset="3970344">They were unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.367" offset="3974315">They had two young children.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.353" offset="3982256">They moved in with Robert Cody's mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.057" offset="4005139">She had five children to support off her Veterans Administration check, and she was receiving food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.512" offset="4038889">Robert and Jerry Cody's food stamp application was denied, and the food stamp office refused to supplement Robert's mother's allotment so that Robert and Jerry and two children, the two young children could have food stamps for the first month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.109" offset="4125302">Three of the appellees' families are headed by women who are little more lucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.580" offset="4147245">They received aid to families with dependent children after they separated from their husbands and moved in with relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.536" offset="4182981">Two of them moved in with their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.637" offset="4195415">They had lived separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.937" offset="4200640">They had maintained a separate home all that time, but due to the family rule they could not receive food stamps separately, even though they purchased and prepared separately, even though their host family's income was not available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.230" offset="4253825">One of the appellees' families, Cecilia Villafranca, moved in with her brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.551" offset="4279111">She had been receiving food stamps, but due to the family rule, she would not have received anything because of her brother's income because both families were deemed to be one household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.511" offset="4342955">Two of the families were headed by men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.147" offset="4365524">Elias Ruiz, his wife, and two children moved in with Elias's mother and her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.403" offset="4398543">They didn't need any help other than a place to live until Mr. Ruiz became unemployed and his wife became too ill to work and was hospitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.228" offset="4445773">They then applied for food stamps and could not get them because of the family rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.615" offset="4467298">Gregorio Alvarado and his wife and three young children moved in with Gregorio's sister and brother-in-law and their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.173" offset="4513587">Gregorio was unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.724" offset="4527797">His wife was also too ill to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.993" offset="4536888">They couldn't get food stamps as a separate household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.778" offset="4547964">And finally, Sylvia Nieto, the only one who had not maintained a separate household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.080" offset="4569175">Sylvia Nieto was an adult woman with a child to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.798" offset="4588088">She was disabled, received supplemental security income benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.702" offset="4607732">The benefits she used to support herself and her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.106" offset="4629361">She had been receiving food stamps as a separate household until the family rule came into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.546" offset="4667082">The family rule, whereas it might be reasonable to believe that families are more likely to purchase and prepare food together, it is not reasonable to believe that these families would commit fraud, would like so they could obtain separate household status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.779" offset="4775960">That is why, that is one of the reasons why the family rule is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.135" offset="4813472">When people like the appellees, people who have no place to go, have no money, have children to support, show up at their relatives' home, the relative, who is slightly better off because they have a place to live, who may not be that much better off, because they may also be on welfare, as Theresa Barrera was, has a hard choice to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.318" offset="4930187">Do they allow their relatives in and deprive their own spouse and children?</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.206" offset="4953698">Even someone who is better off will have to think about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.693" offset="4975640">And if they do allow them in and then find out that they cannot support, either partially or completely, their relatives, they will have to decide whether to deprive their own family so that the relatives can stay with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.471" offset="5046798">That would be a hard choice for anyone, but a lot harder for somebody who is barely existing, for somebody who is on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.545" offset="5095072">And the guest families, the guest family is the one that of course will suffer the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.968" offset="5120777">They will have no control over their situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.170" offset="5133524">They will have children to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.555" offset="5151079">If their host, if their relatives allow them in, the guest family will have to... mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.346" offset="5194233">If the host family refuses to do more, the guest will only have a place to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.600" offset="5223281">If the host family refuses to apply for food stamps, the guest family cannot obtain food stamps on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.456" offset="5258703">And it isn't that unlikely that someone would refuse to apply for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.276" offset="5278034">Disclosures about employment, wages, all other resources such as life insurance and death insurance, burial insurance, everything is required to be reported for food stamp eligibility, and this information is routinely verified by the food stamp office, employees, neighbors, anyone who knows the circumstances of the applicants can be used to verify the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.485" offset="5434873">The food stamp office also uses announced home visits to determine if the information is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.574" offset="5467160">If the family is slightly better off and has a car worth $6,001, the aggregation of resources would make them ineligible for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.481" offset="5514808">Even if this family owed $5,900 on that car, the fair market value of the car is what is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.570" offset="5551170">A first family vehicle will receive a $4,500 exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.991" offset="5576875">It would still make them ineligible for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.010" offset="5588891">The joining of resources such as two cars would cause these people to be ineligible for food stamps also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.568" offset="5631209">A car in places like rural Texas is a necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.870" offset="5648346">It is not a luxury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.722" offset="5651794">It could not be considered a luxury as it would be in a city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.923" offset="5668617">Farm workers need their cars so they can get to and from the fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.141" offset="5685440">Places like Harlingen, Texas, where Robert Cody lives, does not have mass public transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.295" offset="5710099">You need a car so you can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.866" offset="5728385">The government justifies the family rule as necessary to prevent fraud and abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.622" offset="5759418">It is the same justification that was used for the unrelated persons provision in United States Department of Agriculture versus Moreno.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.745" offset="5799856">In that case, the government said that Congress reasonably believed that unrelated persons were more likely to commit fraud so that they could obtain household status so they could obtain food stamps, so that they could participate in the food stamp program, and that it was administratively inefficient for the food stamp agency to determine when the unrelated people were committing fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.966" offset="5932767">They argued that college students live together and were voluntarily poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.036" offset="5957009">They didn't report the income they received from the outside, and it was extremely difficult, maybe impossible for that determination of fraud to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.027" offset="6013015">The Court found in Moreno that the unrelated persons provision served not to exclude those that were intent, those that were most likely to abuse the food stamp program, but only those who were so destitute that they could not alter their living conditions so they could retain the eligibility for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.463" offset="6126700">The same thing happens here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.249" offset="6137880">The family rule causes people that have no place to go to become ineligible for food stamps or receive the reduced amount, an amount that is not based on their resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.193" offset="6205694">And alternatives, alternative provisions can be made if it were to be conceded that there is a problem with fraud by families, the burden could be placed on the family to show why they could not function as a single economic unit or why they could not purchase and prepare food together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.380" offset="6322409">Problems like health problems, contagious diseases, where they could not purchase and prepare food together, are things that can be determined from the initial application and initial food stamp interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.639" offset="6383431">Differential work schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.039" offset="6393044">Presently from the food stamp application and from the initial interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.995" offset="6416868">Questions about where a person works, their employer, the hours worked, and verification of that is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.315" offset="6450200">From that they could find out about differential work schedules that make it impossible for people to purchase and prepare food together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.771" offset="6483951">Inadequate kitchen facilities where, because of the inadequacies of a poor family kitchen they cannot purchase and prepare together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.014" offset="6536927">That determination can be made from questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.232" offset="6553854">And it isn't unlikely that a poor family will have an inadequate kitchen, will have a stove that is two burners instead of what is considered the usual stove with four burners with an oven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.111" offset="6625325">That they will not have refrigeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.063" offset="6637133">That they will not have other than a small table, if they have a table at all, with two chairs, if they have two chairs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.085" offset="6669211">These people cannot purchase and prepare, they certainly cannot prepare food together.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.402" offset="7310465">Yes, the Court said that education is not a mere welfare benefit.</text>
