            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144618">We will hear arguments next in Turner against the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.488" offset="178473">Mr. Snook, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lloyd_snook_iii" startTime="36.274" stopTime="308.448">
            <label>Mr. J. Lloyd Snook, III</label>
            <text syncTime="36.274" offset="289650">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of whether Willie Turner was denied his right to be tried by an impartial jury in his capital murder case where the trial judge refused to allow voir dire about whether the fact that Turner is black and his victim was white would cause prospective jurors to be prejudiced against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.651" offset="379198">In this case, Turner's trial counsel asked the judge at trial, before trial to tell the jury that Turner was black, that his victim was white, and to ask them whether these facts would prejudice you against Willie Lloyd Turner.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.821" offset="435831">The trial court refused, saying simply Question 10, which is the question that we are talking about here, has been ruled on by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.986" offset="468536">I am not going to ask that.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.266" offset="473656">Now, it is important to note that counsel had just immediately before this discussion of voir dire finished discussing with the court the claim that the death penalty was discriminatorily applied against blacks, and particularly against blacks who have killed whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.118" offset="537082">The court had refused any evidence or any hearing, but evidence had been proffered to that effect, and I think it is safe to say that the court had that evidence and that contention firmly in mind at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.035" offset="584729">This Court has held in Ristaino versus Ross that these kinds of claims are to be adjudicated essentially on a case by case analysis in which the question is whether there are special circumstances about the crime that cause one to believe that there is a need for such voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.516" offset="654633">One of our points is that the special circumstances need not be the facts of the case, the facts of the crime or the murder as much as they may also include the facts surrounding the prosecutions, such as in this case, since the facts of the capital murder statute, the nature of the statute under which the prosecution is being conducted, and therefore we have argued that capital murder, the fact of a capital murder prosecution itself is one of those special circumstances that this Court ought to find requires such voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.269" offset="789634">We have addressed all of these issues fully in our briefs, which we incorporate into this argument by reference, but I would like to address one thing in particular in this argument that we have not really focused on before.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.369" offset="834042">That is exactly the scope of a rule that we would suggest that this Court could or should make in such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.352" offset="866016">Now, there is in this Court's jurisprudence on voir dire issues a tension between the virtue of clarity on the one hand that comes with per se rules and on the other hand the flexibility that comes with the discretionary approach or leaving it all to the discretion of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.393" offset="934143">This Court need not decide whether a state must apply a bright line rule in such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.539" offset="962773">Some states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.018" offset="968625">Georgia has, for example, in capital murder cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.432" offset="978342">Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania have in other kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.363" offset="994016">You could continue to rely on Ristaino versus Ross's discretion-based analysis provided that you make clear that the discretion must be exercised in a capital case with due regard for the special circumstances of a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.225" offset="1065487">For example, due regard for the greater discretion that the jury is given in a capital case than was given in Ristaino versus Ross or Rosales-Lopez versus United States or the other cases in which this Court has considered this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.104" offset="1120971">The discretion given to a jury in Virginia to impose the death sentence is basically unlimited once an aggravating circumstance has been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.022" offset="1164647">The Virginia statute is essentially identical to the Georgia statue in this regard, so that the degree of discretion that you found and noted in Zant versus Stevens applies absolutely in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.611" offset="1223057">And the second thing that is important about capital cases is the possibility that racial prejudice will manifest itself in the death and life decision, and for that we have suggested that the history of racial discrimination and the history of the discriminatory application in this country is evidence if not necessarily evidence high enough to allow us to argue to you that the entire statutory scheme should be invalidated, at least high enough to suggest that in the words of Justice White in Rosales-Lopez, that there is a substantial... a more substantial indication of a likelihood of racial prejudice in this kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.579" offset="1522838">Well, I think that there you could again fall back on the case by case sort of analysis, and I don't think it is necessarily wrong to say that in a case where... for example, let us suppose that we are in a place in Texas in which there is a greater history of discrimination against people with Spanish surnames.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.363" offset="1602042">If we are in a place like that, where there is some history of discrimination, that may be more of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.515" offset="1618656">I tend to look at it from the Virginia perspective, where at least in Charlottesville there are very few indeed Hispanics, and so we don't perceive there being a problem of discrimination against Hispanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.693" offset="1659302">In a different community, in a different fact situation, there may well be enough of a problem so that this Court and lower courts would have to find that such voir dire would be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.489" offset="1702561">Mr. Snook, in your submission a moment ago you said that in your view the Court could retain, I thought you said, the basic outline of Ristaino against Ross, which leaves it largely to the discretion of the trial court informed by the facts of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.990" offset="1772569">But you are not suggesting under your rule that a trial judge in Virginia in this case could have exercised his discretion as this particular trial judge did, could you?</text>

            <text syncTime="417.348" offset="1813947">Your Honor, if you choose to apply that, the narrowest possible ground on which we have urged relief in this particular case with simply the decision that the trial judge must consider, at the very least, must consider the unique characteristics of the death penalty statute and the unique characteristics of the death penalty decision, and you add in this particular case the fact that not just the trial and the jury was being move to a different location, but the judge who was conducting the voir dire and counsel also were going to a jurisdiction with which they were not familiar in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.484" offset="1982489">One of the reasons this Court has traditionally given that degree of discretion to the trial judge is that that discretion is informed by familiarity with the local ethos, the local citizenry, which in this case the trial judge did not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.276" offset="3397699">Now, as I said, you could adopt a number of different per se rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.152" offset="3425180">A second might be... a more limited one would be to say every capital case in which the jury does the sentencing, and of course there are about seven states in which the death sentence is imposed where it is really a judge sentencing state, Alabama being one, Florida being another, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.785" offset="3499681">Those are states in which this same rule might not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.876" offset="3512115">Or down to the case of every capital case in a state where the jury has essentially unfettered discretion, as in Georgia, as in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.682" offset="3547328">You can also consider simply the fact of every jury sentencing case, which would be a broader rule that would apply obviously not only to capital cases, but would apply to non-capital cases in those seven states that still have jury sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.400" offset="3602185">But again, you don't have to adopt any one of those per se rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.243" offset="3621516">What you might well do is simply decide that the states must as a matter of constitutional law either adopt a per se rule that considers these facts or must adopt a discretion based rule that considers these facts, but that in either event you must consider the unique characteristics of the capital sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.680" offset="4647292">I don't think so, Your Honor, because the more general question does not call their attention to the fact that the victim was white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.707" offset="4679371">Now, we all know that as a practical matter, what often happens in capital cases is that the jury considers in some way or another the relative worth of the life of the defendant against the relative worth of the life of the man he killed, and it is unfortunately the case that all too often people, blacks, when the blacks are the victims, for whatever reason, the death penalty does not get applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.438" offset="4806326">I have to assume on the basis of all the research that has been done that that is based in large part on the notion that the jurors do take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.283" offset="4841748">Now, I have to assume again that asking the question would have some utility, first of all, because I assume that they are honest jurors, second, because at the very least they would begin to think about the possibility of their own prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.703" offset="4907367">If they did not even know that the race of the victim... that the victim was white, there is no way that they can answer a question that has not been asked, and I don't think it is reasonable to expect as the respondent would have us do that someone hearing the question, do you know of any reason why you could not be fair in this case, would say, if it turns out that the victim is white, I am going to vote to execute him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.247" offset="5001513">And that is basically what they are suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.310" offset="5009767">Now, I have asked to be allowed to reserve some time for rebuttal here, and I would simply like to note that as this Court has noted in Gardner and in Beck, that it is important in this case, as in all capital cases, both... it is important both to the defendant and to the community that any decision to impose the death sentence be and appear to be based on reason rather than emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.037" offset="5104749">All that we are asking in this case is that black capital defendants have the right to be sure that inadmissible influences such as race not be allowed to decide who lives and who dies.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Kulp</label>
            <text syncTime="1380.988" offset="5668471">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court, one of the questions that was asked earlier about the difference between Southampton County, the place in which this crime occurred, and Northampton County, the place in which the trial occurred, in his opening statement to the jury counsel for petitioner, in speaking to the jurors in Northampton County, indicated that the area and the people were basically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.829" offset="5803890">You find this on the transcript of trial, December the 4th, Page 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.564" offset="5826773">I think that the question that counsel for petitioner is asking is, since the judge was not from this county, therefore he had a special duty to determine whether racial prejudice existed in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.236" offset="5909529">This Court has said on many occasions that the trial judge has great discretion, broad discretion to determine the voir dire in a case, and it seems that this Court has indicated that in order for the judge to exercise his discretion, that counsel need to inform him or bring to his attention those matters in which they believe that, particularly in this instance, where they are requesting a specific question, the matters which they think they should call to the judge's attention to require such a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.909" offset="6052158">Now, the situation in this case is that prior to trial over in Northampton County the petitioner's attorneys did make a motion to strike the indictment because of the fact under their position that the statutes in Virginia were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.534" offset="6138675">They did mention to the judge at that time a study from Northeastern University, but the record makes clear they did not introduce the study at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.250" offset="6181516">The study was not actually introduced into the record until the post-sentencing hearing several months after the conviction and sentencing by the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.378" offset="6222058">Several things occurred in between the time that the mention of this study and the question about voir dire occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.056" offset="6268765">Prior to trial, the judge had requested counsel to supply him with questions which they would ask that he ask the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.581" offset="6310874">They did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.383" offset="6318084">One of the questions was, as Mr. Snook has indicated, a question specifically related to a question towards possible racial bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.289" offset="6353715">During the trial, when the judge was taking up the questions, the prosecutor brought to the judge's attention, said that this was not a racial case, it did not involve any racial issues, and that the only thing you had here was a crime where the victim was white and the defendant was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.685" offset="6455279">At that time the petitioner's attorney made no proffer to the court of any reasons why the question should be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.624" offset="6499060">They did not again bring to the judge's attention the Northeastern study or their basis that the question should be asked because in their view the study shows that white victims... defendants who kill white victims are more frequently subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.145" offset="6573144">They didn't tell him anything about, Judge, you are not familiar with this county so therefore you need to give specific attention to whether you know anything about the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.532" offset="6618701">They didn't bring to his attention the things that they had mentioned in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.286" offset="6637718">They set forth a number of factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.776" offset="6643674">Mr. Kulp, the Supreme Court of Virginia's opinion when it is dealing with the question of whether or not the trial judge should have asked this question does have a footnote, as I recall, saying that the defendant had introduced into evidence this study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.549" offset="6710757">It doesn't say when it was introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.389" offset="6718071">Yes, sir, Justice Rehnquist, they do, and it seems that the Supreme Court of Virginia has given credit that the study was introduced on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.175" offset="6753284">I suggest to the Court, however, that a careful reading of the record would indicate that it was not, and then if the Court would look at the post-sentencing bearing when the study actually was introduced into evidence in February of 1980, at that point the attorneys for the defendant again said, we want to now make a part of the record the study from Northeastern as it pertains to our claim of discrimination application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.857" offset="6884001">They didn't really say again that it was for this point, but even if you give credit, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has apparently done, to the defendant for introducing this study on the basis of showing that white victims, defendants who kill white victims are more frequently executed, we submit that the study is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.104" offset="6996954">First of all, the Bowers and Pierce study that was introduced at trial bore no relationship to how the death penalty is being imposed in the state of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.053" offset="7040736">It was based on some statistics in five other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.425" offset="7054215">Now, we submit that at the time this Court decided Furman, all states were basically operating the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.718" offset="7091413">But since this Court handed down the decisions in Gregg, Jurek, and Proffitt, states do not have the same type of statutes any longer, and Virginia, we submit, has one of the more stringent statutes in the country, because not only has Virginia seen fit to narrow the categories on crimes for which a death penalty may be imposed, and it is related to all of the capital murder crimes, had to be wilful, premeditated, and deliberate murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.252" offset="7225578">In Virginia, unlike Texas and Florida and Georgia, Virginia cannot use a felony murder rule in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.077" offset="7260896">In addition to having to show the premeditation and wilful, deliberate murder, it has to be in connection with some other aggravating circumstance such as during the commission of rape or in this case during the commission of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.506" offset="7318574">But not only does the Commonwealth bear the burden of showing those stringent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.673" offset="7351279">A person is not eligible to be subject to the death penalty in the Commonwealth of Virginia unless the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt one of two additional aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.101" offset="7401016">So, we submit that the statute in Virginia is much more stringent than the statutes in other states, and that Virginia should be viewed upon how it is imposing capital murder, not perhaps what they are doing in Georgia or some other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.213" offset="7477398">The studies, as we have indicated in our brief, are clearly fundamentally flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.797" offset="7507805">Each of the studies, the Bowers and Pierce study, which was introduced at the time of trial, and the study by Gross and Morrow which was introduced, I think, during the Federal District Court proceeding on a motion to alter or amend, those studies take all homicides committed in a state and try to compare those with cases in which the death sentence was actually imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.485" offset="7622535">Under Virginia law, for example, they are comparing or would try to be comparing in Gross and Morrow's study, they would be trying to compare capital murder cases with manslaughter cases, with second degree murder cases, with first degree murder cases, all of those of which the defendant is never subject to capital punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.713" offset="8023462">We would suggest to the court that this case is guided by the principles enunciated by the Court in Ristaino versus Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.039" offset="8072677">In that case, this Court said that simply having a black defendant and a white victim is not a special circumstance to warrant the specific inquiry into possible racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.370" offset="8142058">And we submit that in this case, the judge did what he is constitutionally required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.626" offset="8163060">At a time when all the veniremen were present, the defendant, who is black, stood at the time the indictment was read and requested trial by jury, so when all of the veniremen knew the race of the defendant, the judge then asked two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.578" offset="8242891">Do any of you know any reason whatsoever why you cannot render a fair and impartial verdict in these cases either for the defendant or for the Commonwealth of Virginia?</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.764" offset="8287612">The second question the judge asked the veniremen, do any of you know why you cannot render an impartial verdict in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.050" offset="8320736">Now, we submit that those questions, absent the special circumstance as noted by this Court in Ham versus South Carolina, is all that is mandated under constitutional law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.593" offset="8386982">Well, counsel, Mr. Snook responds to that by saying there was no way the jurors could have known at that time that it was a white victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.928" offset="8436301">And presumably they could see that it was a black defendant, but not that it was a white victim, and he also says, this is a capital case in which the jury will have broad discretion in sentencing, so perhaps you ought to address yourself to those aspects of the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.966" offset="8536402">Justice O'Connor, it is true that in this case the jury when they were asked these questions did not know the race of the defendant... or the victim, and as a matter of fact, all during the case neither the prosecutor nor the defendant ever made anything of race either of the defendant or the victim, and it wasn't until about the second or third day of trial when the prosecutor introduced a photograph of the body that the jurors virtually became aware that he was white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.409" offset="8678195">So, there was never any issue made to the jury by the prosecutor or even in the defendant's case that he was white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.335" offset="8713931">Now, it seems that in Ristaino, when the general question was asked, one of the jurors was excused because he admitted to racial bias, and we submit that this is certainly a clear indication that when they know the race of the defendant, that is where the bias, if any there is, would come into play, and since in Ristaino one of the jurors admitted to racial bias, we think that the general question then would draw out from a juror who is going to be honest, and we submit that the asking of the additional question... there is nothing to indicate that a juror, if they were harboring racial bias and they were asked the normal questions and they didn't answer in the affirmative, there is nothing to really indicate that they would answer any more truthfully to a more pointed question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.385" offset="8962094">Now, the fact that it is a capital case, of course, in Virginia, as I have indicated, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt one of two aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.574" offset="9018832">This is, it appears to me, much like in the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.738" offset="9043491">In other words, there are certain factual issues that a jury must focus upon in order to find that a person is subject to capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.436" offset="9090303">Now, this Court in the past, while it has recognized the qualitative different nature of death sentences, has never gone and taken the step of carving out a separate and distinct series of laws to apply to capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.640" offset="9167103">For example, in Barefoot versus Estelle, this Court said that there is no reason not to apply the normal rules of evidence as to using an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.694" offset="9207331">The Court applies the same standard in capital and noncapital cases in Strickland versus Washington, when you deal with ineffective assistance of counsel, and in Wainwright versus Witt the Court said that the excusing for causing of jurors is the same, that you apply the same standard whether you are talking about a capital case or a noncapital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.691" offset="9303358">And we submit that there have been no persuasive reasons presented to this Court which would justify a step as saying that simply because it is a capital case, that therefore you should ask different questions.</text>
