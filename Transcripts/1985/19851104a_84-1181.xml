            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151383">Mr. Kartagener, I think you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven P. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="53.301" offset="364542">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.118" offset="367781">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the Court today is being asked to decide whether a New York City police officer's efforts to conduct a routine inspection of an automobile's vehicle identification number, the VIN, located on a dashboard of a car and ordinarily viewable through the windshield, attending a lawful traffic stop for two observed traffic infractions that were observed by the police officer, constitutes a search as that term is defined within the meaning of the fourth amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.224" offset="512186">Now we, of course, argue preliminarily in our brief that no search occurred here because the police officer's actions did not infringe on any reasonable, justifiable expectation of privacy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="574358">Now, of course, it's been said frequently that there are two sides to every argument, and we recognize that, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="600062">And what makes this case a little bit special, and we'd like the Court to recognize that, is that regardless of how this Court determines this question of search/non-search, unlike some other cases that have come before the Court recently in which that determination was the final outcome determinative here, regardless of how the Court determines the preliminary question, we suggest that the ultimate conclusion of the Court should be the same... that there was no Fourth Amendment violation here... because we do believe that even if this was a search here, the police officer's actions in this case of opening up a car door and reaching within his hand to move aside a paper that covered the vehicle identification number was so manifestly reasonable, so minimally intrusive under the circumstances, that the proper balance between the individual's rights and the compelling interest of society was struck and that no Fourth Amendment sin occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.930" offset="855017">Counsel, did the decision of the court below rest at all upon the New York Constitution?</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven P. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="182.818" offset="882603">Your Honor, the decision of the court below cited the New York State Constitution once in the first sentence of the opinion, finding that the actions of the police officer violated the Fourth Amendment and the New York State Constitution, which by the way is worded in precisely the same fashion as the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.397" offset="964941">Only once does it mention the New York State Constitution, but we think it's rather clear under this Court's determination in Michigan v. Long, the Court does have jurisdiction to hear this case because after mentioning the New York State Constitution, it left it behind and went on to analyze the case in terms of the Fourth Amendment which was cited a number of times within the opinion, and because of the reliance that was placed on a number of the constitutional cases emanating from this Court, cases such as United States v. Chadwick, United States v. Chase, and a number of other cases, and we think that here they only cited the New York State Constitution once in Michigan v. Long... it was twice, and in California v. Carney as well there was a citing to the State's Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.628" offset="1145812">But, we think it clear here that there was not the required plain statement that the decision in this case rested on an adequate and truly independent State ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.572" offset="1329610">The Court saw no need, as it has in so many other cases, as I might point out, Justice O'Connor, that Court, the New York Court of Appeals, is not shy about making its opinion known when it feels that New York law alone might require the exclusion of evidence although the Fourth Amendment does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.850" offset="1394707">I would suggest that since this case came down after Michigan v. Long, the New York Court of Appeals was on ample notice as to how to make that plain statement and chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.122" offset="1427830">It said it violates the Fourth Amendment and the New York State Constitution, and basically left--</text>

            <text syncTime="327.645" offset="1461894">They also said, as I read the last paragraph, that Section 4 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law did not authorize the officer to do what he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.132" offset="1491883">--Well, that is done, Your Honor, because that was refuting an argument that we made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.120" offset="1515811">They did not say that that statute, Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 401, prohibited the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.357" offset="1536709">They merely said that the search violated the Fourth Amendment and 401 which has nothing to do with vehicle identification numbers themselves, did not give the police the authority that we suggest that it might have, and we think that it is one thing to say that a statute doesn't give you the right to do it, and entirely another thing to say the Fourth Amendment proscribes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.953" offset="1619151">The Court did not say that VTL Section 401 prescribed the search, Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.165" offset="1688010">--Well, I think that because it is precisely the same wording, it's logical that they might frequently cite the New York counterpart to the search and seizure provisions of the federal Constitution, but I think it's clear that the decision rested largely on federal grounds.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="409.780" offset="1790410">But what good would it have done to say it authorized it if they had already held that it was constitutionally impermissible for the officer to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="417.100" offset="1819772">The statute couldn't authorize a violation of the Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_p_kartagener" startTime="419.802" stopTime="648.696">
            <label>Mr. Steven P. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="419.802" offset="1830534">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.102" offset="1831788">What we were suggesting, Your Honor, was that under New York law, because there is an obligation to surrender one's certificate of registration, and that's what VTL 401 is all about, that the giving over of the certificate of registration is meaningless if you can't compare the registration against the vehicle identification number.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.882" offset="1910887">So we tried to draw an analog.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.084" offset="1919664">Because the driver was required to hand over the certificate of registration, there had to be an absolute right under the statute to check the vehicle identification number out.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.225" offset="1972222">But what I think is critical once again is that that was an argument that we made as a justification for saying it fit in with the general scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.229" offset="2004196">The Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.747" offset="2010361">But what they did say was, assuming that statute doesn't exist, what you really have here is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.668" offset="2033976">And, as I read this Court's decision in Michigan v. Long, I'd like to suggest that it's precisely the type of discussion that we're having right now, about whether New York law might require or wouldn't require, which has been eschewed by the Court's determination in Michigan v. Long that we shouldn't be getting into that type of a debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.546" offset="2109522">If the face of the opinion does not contain a plain statement from the State Court saving, we are deciding this essentially on an adequate and independent state ground... perhaps here the New York State Constitution or statute, it's not goin' to do that, that opinion, and instead cites the Fourth Amendment repeatedly, and cases from this Court repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.376" offset="2188830">We think it's rather clear that the Court, consistent with Michigan v. Long and California v. Carney has the jurisdiction to consider and to decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.548" offset="2221535">This would not be an extension of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.181" offset="2228013">If anything, it's a diminution of sorts because in Michigan v. Long, as I pointed out, it had two citations to the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.883" offset="2250896">Here we've got only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.601" offset="2257688">I've suggested to the Court that there are two bases, or two sides of the line here, search or non-search, and we suggest that we should prevail under either.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.624" offset="2297812">But, we do believe that as a matter of constitutional law and as a matter of common sense, the sounder conclusion is that no search did occur here.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.647" offset="2333966">Why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="546.882" offset="2338877">Because we know that the term "search" has a very special meaning in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.301" offset="2356536">There is no search unless the Government intrudes upon a reasonable, justifiable or legitimate, if you will, expectation of privacy that the individual has, and we suggest to you that clearly, under the circumstances of this case, the Respondent could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.708" offset="2722145">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="570.914" offset="2435007">To begin with, we're dealing with an automobile, not the individual's person, not his home, not his office, an automobile which this Court has recognized involves a reduced expectation of privacy in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.707" offset="2490178">And why is there that reduced expectation of privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.159" offset="2503971">Some of the early decisions of this Court noted the relatively open configuration of the Court... of the car, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.229" offset="2528212">But in California v. Carney the Court says, but there's another very special thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.115" offset="2547752">Cars are pervasively regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.983" offset="2567292">Well, here you have pervasive government regulation of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.137" offset="2583905">You have a car being stopped because of traffic infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.939" offset="2603132">Everybody knows you have to hand over your registration, your license, and today frequently the insurance card, and yet... and presumably to give meaning to that governmental regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.580" offset="2649630">Yet, what happens if you can't look at the VIN?</text>
            <text syncTime="628.198" offset="2664154">It means that the whole concept of regulating automobiles becomes nugatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.919" offset="2687037">Because the VIN, the Vehicle Identification Number, is the heart of, the sine qua non of that entire pervasive regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.242" offset="2724340">Because my registration and anyone else's usually has the car's Vehicle Identification Number.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.173" offset="2904062">Well, Justice Blackmun, I'll be quite frank about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.391" offset="2924856">The best police practice, I do believe, and I've read some of the police training manuals, is to keep the individual in the car on some occasions, depending on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.746" offset="2958292">However, in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, it was condoned to bring an individual out of the car if there is a concern for the police officer's safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.204" offset="3000193">There doesn't have to be a reasonable suspicion or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.938" offset="3007089">Sometimes he'll bring the individual out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.423" offset="3017016">Generally speaking, I do believe, police officers maintain greater control by keeping the individuals in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.910" offset="3042929">But what happened here, it's not the police officer who got the individual out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.798" offset="3058498">What happened was, answering Justice Stevens' question, is that the car was pulled over.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.683" offset="3074067">Before the police officers even got up to the individual's car, the Respondent here, the defendant down below, gets out of his car and walks back to the police officers' car.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.622" offset="3113773">As he was speaking to Officer Meyer, his partner, his regular partner, Officer McNamee, walked up to the Respondent's car to try to look at the vehicle, inspect the Vehicle Identification Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.365" offset="3164764">What happened then?</text>
            <text syncTime="754.481" offset="3169257">He assumed because it was an older car, and the earlier case before this Court that he dealt with a very expensive car, this was not such an expensive car.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.468" offset="3201231">It was a '72 Dodge Duster.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.687" offset="3214083">It was an older car.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.872" offset="3222861">The officer assumed the VIN might be on the door jamb as the older cars had, so he opened up the car door to look on the door jamb, did not see the VIN number there.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.394" offset="3252954">He then knew that it would have to be in one location, on the dashboard in a position that should be viewable through the windshield, because mandatory federal regulation now says that ever since 1969 the VIN belongs there so everybody, including police officers, can look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.587" offset="3317633">And, what does he find?</text>
            <text syncTime="792.487" offset="3321290">A little bit of paper, a mischievous scrap of paper, is covering the VIN number.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.408" offset="3448976">I hate to leave a question unanswered, and so if I may answer the question that was asked of me by Justice Stevens at the end of the morning's argument, the question was did the police officer do anything with the Vehicle Identification Number, if I remember the answer correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.199" offset="3500176">And the answer, Justice Stevens, is that he never really had the opportunity to do anything with it because as he was reaching into the car to move the scrap of paper off of the VIN number he looks down, and what does he notice?</text>
            <text syncTime="849.007" offset="3547406">Lo and behold, sticking out from underneath the seat... he did not look under the seat, but sticking out by about an inch is the handle of a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.762" offset="3578335">He recovered the pistol and then the Vehicle Identification Number became at least somewhat de minimis because what they were confronted with then was the felony of an unlawful weapons possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.802" offset="3618563">But I would point out also, the defendant, the Respondent here, did receive two traffic infractions summonses in addition to being arrested for the felony and to some extent the VIN number became at least somewhat... or less important because they also discovered during the course of their inquiry and discussions with the defendant that he was an unlicensed driver as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.603" offset="3713754">So, the likelihood is, this was not going to be the type of case where they would check a VIN number and let the defendant perhaps drive on his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.256" offset="3740399">This was a situation where he was not going to be allowed to get back into that car and drive it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.581" offset="4549672">I think it is reasonable even if he is out of the car, just as in a Belton situation, if an individual is handcuffed, the police still have the right to search the interior of the car if there's been a full-blown arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.925" offset="4598991">We suggest that it is a much more fluid situation when someone has not been subjected at that point to the full-blown arrest and handcuffed, can theoretically get back into the car if he wishes to take a desperate effort because he knows he's got a gun there, and perhaps hurt the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.166" offset="4656043">And I would suggest, Your Honor, when we address... and I don't wish you to dwell on it at great length now... the final portion of our argument, but I would point out that our final argument in the brief in which we argue that there should be a right, where there has been a lawful traffic stop, and there exists the right to execute a full arrest, if the police officers decided whether or not to do that there should be the right to do a visual frisk of the interior of the car to protect the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.102" offset="4767742">We make that argument because I think the statistics, the real world statistics, support it and I think the Court is very sensitive to police safety, both in the Belton context and in the context we'd ask it to be sensitive to, in sub-point "D" of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.605" offset="5917757">I have argued, and I think legitimately, that it is not a search at all because there was no legitimate expectation of privacy in the VIN number or the information in it, nor could the defendant or respondent create a legitimate or reasonable expectation of privacy by allowing a piece of paper to cover that VIN number, just as the people in Oliver could not create a reasonable expectation of privacy by putting up "don't trespass" signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.955" offset="6119109">But if I may answer your question, if it's under the hood, let us say, or in the back seat and there was a legitimate basis for checking the Vehicle Identification Number, yes, we would say that if police officers know that that's where the Vehicle Identification Number is, they have the right to check it out once probable cause exists, and you do have probable cause here for the traffic infractions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.829" offset="6386603">I would like to commence my argument by responding to as question that was posed both by Justice O'Connor and Justice Stevens before the lunch break, and in doing so we would like to emphasize that it is our contention that the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals was decided on adequate and independent state grounds, both in the New York State Constitution, Article 1, Section 12 which was cited by the Court of Appeals in its decision in this case, in which that Court is used in a whole host of cases to declare a substantial independent right against unreasonable searches and seizures under New York's Constitution, and also under Section 401 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.643" offset="6569878">In its opinion rendered below, the Court of Appeals discussed the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, Section 401, to determine whether in the case of an ordinary traffic violation, whether an officer has a right to search the car for the Vehicle Identification Number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.705" offset="6650126">The Court of Appeals held that Section 401 gives the officer absolutely no authorization to conduct a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.627" offset="6685861">The correct procedure for an officer to follow when he wants VIN information, other information to identify the car, is for the officer to make a demand.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven P. Kartagener</label>
            <text syncTime="3268.977" offset="13227236">Your Honors, if I may be allowed a reply, I think as the questions of this Court have pointed up to some extent, the Respondent brought the police action in this case on himself to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.968" offset="13279167">He allowed the VIN to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.668" offset="13285959">He chose to get out of the car and walk away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.220" offset="13296199">My colleague... or my adversary, I should say, here, seems to suggest that the Fourth Amendment should be something that rewards a motorist for defeating the Congressional intent in having exposed VIN numbers, that if he chooses not to keep it exposed as expected by Congress the Fourth Amendment should rule it improper if a police officer merely reaches in to uncover the VIN.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.820" offset="13398599">I suggest... the silliness, I think of the New York Court of Appeals' position that what the police had to do here was send the individual back into the car to move a piece of paper out of the way himself is pointed up and underscored by the fract that the police do have some right to be concerned about police safety, and as Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan pointed out in their dissent in the Michigan v. Long case, they thought that if we're concerned about police safety once the individual's out of the car, the most minimal thing to do is for the police officer to go into the car if he's looking for a registration, once the motorist has told him where it is, and go to that certainly identifiable place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.047" offset="13559514">Here, this police officer was not engaged in a rummaging search of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.749" offset="13574351">He looked under no seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.749" offset="13578322">He went to the place on the dashboard, moving across open space, where he expected the VIN to be located, happened to look down and see a gun butt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.689" offset="13610087">And, if I might respond to something Justice White spoke about, could the police officer even have seen it from outside, possibly?</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.693" offset="13638090">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.378" offset="13640807">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.095" offset="13643732">Because it's a settled fact in this case, the gun butt was out one inch from under the seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.930" offset="13663063">Now, it's true that this police officer didn't notice it at the time, although a pedestrian on the other side of the car might have been able to, and I think Texas v. Brown says the police will have the same rights as any pedestrian on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.971" offset="13703187">The police officers might have been able to see it from outside the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.875" offset="13750834">It happened to pop up, if you will, or jumped out and bit him as he happened to be reaching across, but it really was sticking out in plain view from under the seat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.933" offset="13791063">Plain view, I would certainly... once the door was opened, we believe, reasonably... but it would seem pretty obvious from outside the car had the police officer been looking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.205" offset="13828157">I say this, Justice Rehnquist, because there is a finding of fact in this case that out from under the seat, towards the front of the car by at least one inch, was the observable, identifiable gun butt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.516" offset="13913421">To see if it could be done I went to a car, I mean to see what the views were, I went to the other side rather than the driver's side, looked in the open window, and you really can't see everything coming out an inch from under the seat of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.074" offset="13955634">But, the Court doesn't have to determine that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.840" offset="13966710">I just suggest that it was not the type of rummaging search that the Court need believe it implicates the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.779" offset="14318423">Yes, I would suggest that in any case where a VIN number's covered on the dash, and the driver stepped away from the car, it's not necessary for the police under Mimms to bring the driver back to the car, to open up the door and step in, and indeed they probably would have seen the gun at that point anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.939" offset="14375056">So, in closing, I'd simply like to say that we would like the Court to find, as we think that it should, that the actions of the police officers in this case were so eminently reasonable, and the ruling and opinion of the New York Court of Appeals was not reasonable, and therefore that you should reverse that judgment of that Court.</text>
