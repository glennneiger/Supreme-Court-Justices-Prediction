            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="53.551" offset="361219">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court today is whether the Federal Rules of Evidence are unconstitutional insofar as they permit the introduction in evidence in a criminal trial of co-conspirator declarations without requiring the prosecution to produce the declare or to demonstrate his unavailability.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.047" offset="451185">Now, in terms of potential impact, this may be the most important critical procedure case that the Court has had to decide in the years that I have been in the Solicitor General's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.355" offset="496429">While affirmance of the Third Circuit's decision would probably have little impact on the trial as seen by the jurors, the behind the scenes effect on the allocation of criminal justice system resources would be dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.282" offset="552122">On this case, which was a drug prosecution, the prosecution sought to use five recorded conversations as evidence against respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.137" offset="595485">Three of those conversations he was a party to, and we're between him and a co-conspirator, John Lazaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.409" offset="624638">A fourth conversation was between two individuals who testified as prosecution witnesses at trial, and the fifth conversation was between Lazaro and a co-conspirator named Levin, who invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and was found unavailable at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="695795">Respondent demanded that the prosecution show the unavailability of any co-conspirator declarants, and to accommodate the District Court's practical wishes, the prosecution did subpoena Lazaro to appear for trial, but he failed to appear, allegedly due to car troubles.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.534" offset="781059">Ultimately, the District Court ruled that Lazaro's statements on these intercepted conversations were admissible under the traditional co-conspirator exception now embodied in Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.628" offset="833513">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.663" offset="845634">It, too, found that Rule 801 was satisfied, but it found that the confrontation clause was violated because the prosecution had not satisfactorily demonstrated that the co-conspirator Lazaro was unavailable to testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.355" offset="912403">Now, in reaching this ruling, it relied almost entirely on dicta from this Court's decision in Ohio against Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.795" offset="946153">We have discussed at some length in our brief both the historical evolution of the confrontation right of common law and its adoption in the Sixth Amendment and the parallel but distinct development of the hearsay rule and exceptions, including the co-conspirator exception, and I have no intention of repeating that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.157" offset="1019609">Suffice it to say that the co-conspirator exception emerged simultaneously with the adoption of the confrontation right and the Sixth Amendment, and as it was refined during the period from 1780 to 1980, it was, as far as I know, never suggested by any Court or any legislature that a showing of unavailability of the extrajudicial declarant, co-conspirator, was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.924" offset="1126711">And the same is true, I might add, of the vast majority of other hearsay exceptions and exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.496" offset="1152938">Can it be that the judges, the legislators, the practitioners, and the scholars who have contributed to the evolution of the common law of evidence over this period and who contributed to the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in doing so, who took into account in their consideration of hearsay rules the very same interests that are said to underlie the confrontation clause, can it be that all of these people have so consistently violated fundamental principles of fair play embodied in the somewhat vague and general language of the Sixth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="283.115" offset="1279475">Can it be that for decade after decade, thousands of state as well as federal courtrooms across the land have seen the basic right of confrontation repeatedly violated by the admission of co-conspirator declarations without any showing of the unavailability of the declarant?</text>
            <text syncTime="300.161" offset="1347603">We think that is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.763" offset="1358052">Far more likely, in our opinion, is the view that the dictum in Ohio against Roberts referred to the class of cases, that is, prior testimony and the like, in which the unavailability requirement in this Court's decisions cited in Roberts parallel a similar development of the hearsay rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.724" offset="1433911">I am curious, Mr. Frey.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.378" offset="1448435">You talk about the tremendous significance of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.346" offset="1468393">As I understand it, several states have determined as a matter of state constitutional law to require the enforcement of proof of unavailability and reliability to produce evidence such as this in a co-conspirator situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.647" offset="1569539">Has the experience of those states been such that law enforcement agencies have been hampered in their--</text>

            <text syncTime="363.686" offset="1601722">I am not sure that I am aware of what you are referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.455" offset="1616768">As far as I know, and as far as I recollect from the respondent's brief, the development of this requirement of production or showing of unavailability is all post-1980, post the dictum in Ohio against Roberts, and it has happened in a number of federal courts, and I believe that when this Court speaks even in dictum, it does have a powerful effect on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.455" offset="1724811">I can't tell you what the experience has been, but I do hope to address some of the reasons why I think the costs and benefits clearly suggest that it is a bad rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.596" offset="1777369">--Would it depend in part on how strictly one has to prove unavailability?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="414.536" stopTime="472.188">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="414.536" offset="1805059">That would be only a small part of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.738" offset="1813941">That would be a part of the problem, and that would be something that would have to be fleshed out over out over probably decades of litigation and numerous cases in this Court, as it has taken decades to flesh out the unavailability requirement in connection with prior testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.230" offset="1879874">Now, it is not essential, I think, to the Court's decision here, but I want to spend just a minute on the question of whether the confrontation clause reaches so far as to regulate co-conspirator declarations or other kinds of hearsay generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.625" offset="1949464">We have argued in our brief that it doesn't speak at all to co-conspirator declarations or other kinds of hearsay by and large, and that it is in fact specifically concerned with prior testimony, depositions, affidavits, and those kinds of testimonial, out of court testimonial utterances.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="472.188" offset="2035668">You say in effect that if the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted against in open court, the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted on the same principal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="486.698" stopTime="702.023">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="486.698" offset="2093764">That is a part of the rationale for the co-conspirator declaration, and we would certainly say that, but I think what we are saying is broader in this immediate connection, which is that it was never intended for the confrontation clause to concern itself with most kinds of hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.660" offset="2165653">The early cases which are cited at Page 22 of our brief, state cases, suggest that the witnesses that the Sixth Amendment says and the state constitutional provision said the defendant had to be allowed to confront are those people who appear in court and give testimony about the hearsay declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.073" offset="2239214">Now, I am not suggesting that that is the limit of the reach of the provision, but in the Mattox case of this Court, which is the first case to really consider this issue, the Court said that the primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or ex parte affidavits such as were sometimes admitted in civil cases being used against a prisoner in lieu of personal examination and cross examination of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.807" offset="2350182">Now, that also, I think, is to some extent the view of Wigmore and Justice Harlan's view in concurrence in Dutton against Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.448" offset="2396785">And the Court indicated in Roberts that that view had not been accepted by this Court, and at the other extreme is the view which I understand respondent to take and which may be supported by dictum in Dutton and Roberts, that all hearsay is regulated by the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.677" offset="2469719">It doesn't mean it is excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.727" offset="2473898">It means it is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.412" offset="2480586">Now, I would propose to the Court that the better view is that out of court declarations of a kind that are retrospective but done in contemplation of trial, that are of a testimonial nature... when the Sixth Amendment refers to a witness, what it is referring to is somebody who is giving testimony or the functional equivalent of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.311" offset="2576194">That could reach so far as to include accomplice confessions under police interrogation, which are retrospective, and in large part obtained for purposes of solving crimes and litigating cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.202" offset="2627812">It does not, however, reach business records, present sense impression, co-conspirator declarations, the kind of res gestae exceptions that the main body of hearsay exception law is concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.580" offset="2689252">In any event, even if the domain of the confrontation clause does embrace hearsay generally, it seems to us extraordinarily clear that the clause does not invalidate traditional evidence law regarding the exceptions to the prohibition on use of hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.340" offset="2756334">And, of course, why should it do that when these exceptions were developed with consideration of the very same concerns, the importance of cross examination, the necessity in some circumstances of withholding from the jury evidence, or the necessity of making it available, that underlie the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.288" offset="2844106">In cases like Mattox and the Delaney case in 1924 which involved a confrontation clause, co-conspirator declarations, brushed off the suggestion that traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule might run afoul of the confrontation clause, and in both Dutton against Evans and Ohio against Roberts, the Court was at pains to reaffirm that the traditional exceptions were not being called into question by those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.023" offset="2955074">Does it make any difference at all that the rule treats co-conspirator statements as exempt from being hearsay, and the other rules treat exceptions to the hearsay rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="743.366" offset="3120377">--Well, we have a long footnote in our reply brief that addresses that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.068" offset="3135214">I would say that the exemption is based on three different considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.453" offset="3156739">It is based on an agency rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.055" offset="3167188">It is based on the fact that co-conspirator declarations by their nature often involve verbal acts or other non-hearsay, components because they are frequently part of the res gestae of the offense itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.397" offset="3228524">They involve other kinds of things that may be accepted under Rule 803 exceptions, and so by having a general exception you save the Court a very difficult task of teasing out the hearsay from the non-hearsay and the hearsay exceptions from the non-excepted hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.876" offset="3298427">And finally, because there is an element of reliability in statements that are made by venturers to further the objective of the venture--</text>

            <text syncTime="799.184" offset="3343671">--They are against interest, but of course we don't know... my colleague here will tell you that agency is purely the rationale and not reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.889" offset="3390483">I am not sure why she thinks that helps her.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.957" offset="3398842">If agency is the rationale, why shouldn't the principal produce this agent rather than the principal's accountant in the litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="822.597" offset="3437399">Now, of course, Lazaro may no longer have seen Inadi's agent at the time of trial, but the point that I think is important is that the decision has been made consistently throughout time that no showing of unavailability is to be required in connection with co-conspirator declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.361" offset="3512422">How would you use the confrontation clause to veto that judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="847.415" offset="3536664">I just simply don't see what you would look to as a source of arriving at some different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.734" offset="3565921">Now, I will say with respect to the Roberts dictum, because I think that is the source of most of the holdings that have done against our position, that I think they misread what Roberts says.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.494" offset="3616912">First of all, it seems to me plain that the dictum in Roberts was meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive, but it would be a wholly inaccurate description of the state of the law with respect to most co-con... most hearsay exceptions including the co-conspirator declaration, but totally accurate as an explanations of the treatment of depositions and prior testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="892.859" offset="3718372">Now, secondly, if you read the dictum literally, it goes too far, because it not only imposes the requirement of showing unavailability and reliability on co-conspirator declarations, but it invalidates all of Rule 803.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.487" offset="3796948">Now, respondent is going to try to get around that, but the fact of the matter is that if you read it literally it makes Rule 803 unconstitutional as well as Rule 801, if you don't read it literally, then I don't understand why you should not read it as limited to the proposition established by the cases that it cites, which are prior testimony cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="935.750" offset="3889944">Now, let me turn to the question of policy, because I do think that is what concerns us so gravely about the third circuit's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.522" offset="3933098">The question is, assuming that the Court has the license under the Constitution to do so, whether there is any reason why the Court, concerned as it must be with fair and efficient administration of criminal justice, would want the unavailability role that the Third Circuit has adopted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.103" offset="4011361">In other words, can we expect significant benefits to the fairness and accuracy of the criminal trial to be derived at acceptable cost from this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.209" offset="4047828">It seems to me the answer is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.910" offset="4058591">Let me look first at the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.779" offset="4070084">The first point to notice about the Third Circuits's rule is that it does not keep out evidence that the jury can't be trusted to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.385" offset="4104462">The co-conspirator declarations come in if the declarant is shown to be unavailable, and under the Third Circuits's rule, although I think not under the position that respondent was requesting in District Court, they come in if the declarant is available and is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.680" offset="4173634">Part of the reason they come in, and the reason why at least that part of the Third Circuit's rule is good, is because the declarations have independent evidentiary value apart from any in court testimony that the declarant may give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.237" offset="4227864">There are statements made while the objective of the illegal transaction was being advanced, and for the purpose of advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.110" offset="4267361">By the time the witness appears in court many factors may have played on him to affect his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.199" offset="4291707">I am not saying in any given case which... whether the co-conspirator declaration or the in court testimony is more valuable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.661" offset="5093562">If all we have to do is produce them in court, then it seems to me not a confrontation clause issue at all, and the defendant's right to compulsory process assures his production.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.408" offset="5172556">We don't want his evidence in, his in court evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.777" offset="5186035">The defense doesn't want his in court evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.062" offset="5195231">What is the purpose of this charade?</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.045" offset="5203172">It seems to me it will simply end up confusing the jury without serving any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.668" offset="5229608">Now, respondent has said a lot about the importance of the right of cross examination, and I don't mean to speak against the value of cross examination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.058" offset="5279240">It clearly is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.427" offset="5288644">But respondent has not explained why that right of cross examination is not protected by Rule 806 of the Rules of Evidence which allowed respondent to call Lazaro as a witness and cross examine him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.235" offset="5339949">It specifically says in the case of hearsay declarants, you can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.720" offset="5361892">So I don't think the problem was an inability to cross examine Lazaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.091" offset="5375371">The problem was a desire to jerk the prosecution around, which is essentially what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.495" offset="5400971">Now, the fact is that if the co-conspirator declarant is not already being called by one party or the other as a witness, it is probably because he is in fact unavailable, or is judged not to be a desirable source of evidence, and what the Third Circuit's rule requires is that prosecutors produce or show the unavailability of every co-conspirator declarant even though it produced virtually none of these would be called to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.993" offset="5502953">Now, does that rule make any sense at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.597" offset="5517373">Now, let me turn to the cost side, because Justice O'Connor did ask that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.149" offset="5951528">Many of them may be in the defense camp or sympathetic with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.951" offset="5966783">They may be afraid of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.087" offset="5975351">They are not people who are totally within our control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.707" offset="5997817">Now, we have to produce these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.676" offset="6009624">Suppose that is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.845" offset="6014326">Well, first of all, some of the people, we will know who they are, and we will know where they can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.980" offset="6034911">That is not always the case, but if that is the case, as it was the case here, production may be relatively easy in many instances, plus, as we have pointed out, particularly since these are co-conspirators, a lot of them will be in jail, and producing then will be quite a costly and burdensome exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.060" offset="6111188">But even if they are not in jail, we can subpoena them, as indeed we did in this case, and we may find that they have gone fishing, or that they had car trouble, or that they are sick, and they may not appear in response to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.220" offset="6167822">Well, then what is to happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.353" offset="6172419">Is the judge to stop the trial while a search goes on for this declarant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.807" offset="6198228">You know, again, maybe this is worthwhile if this is a witness who is actually going to be called upon by somebody to give testimony at trial, but we are talking about somebody who is to be trotted into the courtroom, who nobody wants as a witness of their own, so it is an awful lot of trouble for somebody who the parties don't want as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.253" offset="6279939">And then, even worse, what happens if we have trouble identifying who the declarant is, or if we have difficulty in locating a declarant who may have made a declaration five years ago that we want to introduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.595" offset="6321317">We may not know where he is, how far do we have to go to locate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.147" offset="6343573">We are going to have litigation, and this is the final point that I want to make, is the effect on the courts of all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.403" offset="6368546">The effect of the courts on the unavailability requirement to date has been slight because the number of instances of using prior testimony are relatively few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.859" offset="6406372">The number of instances of using co-conspirator declarations are many, and if you just sit back for a minute and think that every time the prosecution wants to use a co-conspirator declaration, they will have to produce or demonstrate the unavailability of the declarant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.801" offset="6474186">If they fail to produce him, there will be litigation, endless litigation about whether they are culpable, about whether he is really unavailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.263" offset="12587988">And that is why it is so important that the government standard is only by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.965" offset="12610871">It is worthy, I think, of note in this case that with regard to co-conspirator declarations, this Court has spoken relatively recently in Dutton versus Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.891" offset="12658519">Delaney is not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.257" offset="12663952">In Delaney the declarant was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.093" offset="12671371">The court analyzed the co-conspirator exception in two sentences, and in one of the sentences it was that the declarant was not available to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.847" offset="12698329">But in Dutton you have an alternative basis for upholding the Court of Appeals even were you to rule that they were wrong in the application of Ohio against Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.186" offset="12739707">Now, I do not believe that you will come to the conclusion that they were wrong, but it is important to note that this Court has precedent in its own decisions for assessing the relationship of the confrontation clause and co-conspirator declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.212" offset="12795818">And Dutton applied to this case would require a determination that the Court of Appeals judgment should be upheld, because in this case, unlike Dutton, the evidence adduced by the government, insulated from cross examination, was crucial and devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.205" offset="12851825">The government has never contended that the utility of trial confrontation would have been remote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.965" offset="13018799">I have never actually prosecuted the case at the trial level, but presumably there has been a grand jury, and we know what some of the witnesses are going to say from that testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.251" offset="13340001">Well, my conceptual approach is a lot like it, but not identical to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.571" offset="13361213">Let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.221" offset="13363825">First of all, I do not concede that Lazaro is the government's witness, because we introduced statements made during the course of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.427" offset="13400710">It seems to me the point that I am trying to make is that a witness is somebody who has made a statement of a testimonial character, and it seems to me that a declaration of a co-conspirator in the course of a conspiracy is not testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.670" offset="13453686">It is an event that is occurring in the course of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.622" offset="13465493">It is quite different from the statement, and Justice Harlan had a little difficulty dealing with Dutton and... Dutton particularly because of how you deal with an accomplice's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.780" offset="13518052">Now, I would say that an accomplice's confession is testimonial, and makes him a witness if it used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.017" offset="13543025">Now, it may be able to be used under the confrontation clause anyway, or it may not, depending on confrontation clause rules, but I think that my approach of asking whether the out of court declaration is testimonial in character and therefore makes him a witness within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment is different from Justice Harlan's approach, and I think it should commend itself... I hope it would commend itself to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.151" offset="13639573">Let me get back to Dutton against Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.834" offset="13646261">Justice Rehnquist asked about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.853" offset="13654411">First of all, the statement of Dutton was clearly inadmissible under evidence law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.423" offset="13676667">It was gotten in in a totally improper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.840" offset="13686280">It has been said by the advisory committee that the... excuse me, Douglas against Alabama I am referring to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.147" offset="13723583">It has been said by the advisory committee that that was really a case that was largely concerned with prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.301" offset="13748138">When we come to Dutton, which is a co-conspirator declaration not within the traditional rule, I would like to read what the Court said about the traditional co-conspirator declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.407" offset="13784605">This is at Page 80 of 400 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.276" offset="13796099">"The argument seems to be rather that in any given case the Constitution requires a reappraisal of every exception to the hearsay rule no matter how long established in order to determine whether, in the words of the Court of Appeals, it is supported by salient and cogent reasons. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.119" offset="13855449">"The logic of that position would seem to require a constitutional reassessment of every established hearsay exception, federal or state, but in the present case it is argued only that the hearsay exception applied by Georgia is constitutionally invalid because it doesn't conform to the federal hearsay exception. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.878" offset="13918457">"Appellee does not challenge and we do not question the validity of the co-conspirator exception applied in the federal courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.365" offset="13940399">And in Ohio against Roberts, I think the court again suggested that the traditional co-conspirator exception was not being called into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.071" offset="13971224">Now, as far as what the government said or didn't say at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.757" offset="13990032">I believe at the time of trial there was a Third Circuit decision called Gibbs, a panel decision later overruled en banc that did require us to produce or show the unavailability of a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.565" offset="14033186">As far as what respondent's position was at trial, if you look at Page 17 of the appendix, you will see that they thought unavailability was a condition of admission and production would not do to get the statement in.</text>
