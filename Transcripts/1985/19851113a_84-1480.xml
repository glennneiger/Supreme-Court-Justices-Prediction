            <text syncTime="10.793" offset="185727">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent David Greenfield was convicted in a jury trial of sexually battery committed with force likely to cause serious personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.820" offset="225851">Respondent's conviction was affirmed by the Florida appellate courts, and his petition for writ of habeas corpus relief was denied by the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.410" offset="272140">The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court and ordered a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.111" offset="294919">This case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.202" offset="311324">The first, and perhaps the most critical, whether the state may use a defendant's most-Miranda warning behavior, including his post-Miranda warning silence, as evidence of his sanity at or near the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.961" offset="386348">The second issue, simply stated, is whether the Eleventh Circuit either ignored or misconstrued Wainwright versus Sikes in holding that respondent's failure to timely object to the testimony that he challenged in this cause could be excused by 20 subsequent objections to the prosecutor's closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.014" offset="478612">The facts in this case are somewhat important, and I want to go into them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.011" offset="506615">Respondent was charged with sexual battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.307" offset="519781">He initially pled not guilty, and then prior to trial changed that plea to one of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.898" offset="550083">In other words, his defense was that at the time of the crime, he was not sufficiently aware to know the nature of the Act that he was committing or to know that it was wrong, to be able to distinguish that which was right from wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.264" offset="619569">The state presented proof that the offense was committed, and then offered the testimony of Officer Russell Pilafont regarding the arrest of respondent some two hours after the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.211" offset="691353">Officer Pilafont indicated that Greenfield met the description that he had and he placed him under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.785" offset="729701">He escorted Greenfield down to the police car, read him his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.158" offset="751122">Greenfield went on and said, yes, I understand them, I think I would like to talk to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.280" offset="771602">In the police car on the way to the station the officer again elaborated on those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.574" offset="796784">The officer... Greenfield said, yes, thank you very much for explaining that to me, I do think I would like to speak to an attorney before I talk with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.758" offset="845580">Another, police officer gave similar testimony regarding Greenfield's behavior once he arrived at the police station, and no objection was made to the police officer's testimony at the time that it came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.267" offset="899602">Both sides--</text>

            <text syncTime="247.103" offset="1130942">They did in fact get him a lawyer to talk to, and he did speak with the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.321" offset="1155811">Both sides offered psychiatric testimony, and I think the kindest thing that can be said is, there were two psychiatrists that testified for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.254" offset="1203562">One testified for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.876" offset="1210041">They couldn't have said more entirely different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.188" offset="1227282">They went into great detail as to the basis for their opinions, the sorts of considerations that they looked at, and during closing arguments, the prosecutor argued that Officer Pilafont's testimony regarding respondent's exercise of his Miranda rights, the whole colloquy from the time he met... it was part of the whole description of Greenfield's behavior from the time Officer Pilafont encountered him on the beach to the arrest which followed, argued this whole chain of behavior as evidence that the jury could consider tending to support sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.497" offset="1416513">The defendant objected at this time, and the objection was overruled by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.681" offset="1449218">The Eleventh Circuit ultimately ordered a new trial in this cause, stating that the prosecutor... the use of respondent's sanity at his trial violated the decision of this court in Doyle versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.906" offset="1526122">In so doing, they brought themselves in conflict with Sulie versus Duckworth, the Seventh Circuit case, which basically said that Doyle did not apply in the context of an insanity defense, and that really is the crucial question here, and the distinction the state draws between Doyle in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.398" offset="1624134">In Doyle, of course, this Court held that a respondent's silence following the Miranda warnings was insolubly ambiguous, that it should not be used to suggest to the jury that... I think the inference that we realize juries traditionally make, which is, if this defendant were innocent, if he did not commit this crime, well, then why when confronted with it by the police did he fail to make a statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.023" offset="1770629">Doyle prescribed this use of silence after the Miranda warning had been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.333" offset="1799886">Our argument today is that where, as in this case, the issue is not whether Greenfield committed the substantive offense, it is virtually uncontroverted that he committed sexual battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.669" offset="1877208">The question becomes whether he should be held accountable for his conduct at the time of that offense because he allegedly did not know right from wrong, but this evidence was relevant and probative on the sanity question, and the jury had a right to consider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.644" offset="1961113">Ms. Paschall, just reviewing the quotation that the Eleventh Circuit made on Pages A9, All of the brief, petitioner's brief on jurisdiction, a lot of the prosecutor's references there strike me as not having been addressed to the defendant's silence at all coupled to his behavior before he ever received the Miranda warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.211" offset="2075321">Supposing the issue were just guilt and not insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.695" offset="2089322">Wouldn't some of that be able to come in under Doyle?</text>

            <text syncTime="495.644" offset="2125058">The problem as I see it with Doyle would be at the point when the prosecutor argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.296" offset="2151703">You know, he spoke to an attorney, and then still he will not speak.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.062" offset="2326723">I think you have to look in the record... at the record in this cause and realize we are talking about a whole sequence of behavior, a whole Pilifont met Greenfield on the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.430" offset="2376251">This is the exchange that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.024" offset="2382625">This was some two hours after the offense, when one of the defense psychiatrists says, well, that is part of why I can tell he was crazy.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.880" offset="2410002">He would have run from the police officer if he had been in his right mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.597" offset="2424944">So, two hours after the offense we are looking at what he did, what he said, how he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.234" offset="2459425">We are not standing up here and saying, oh, my, any time the defendant didn't say anything at all, he stood absolutely mute, he must have been sane, he must have known what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.509" offset="2516581">We are not even suggesting, and I don't think we have to suggest this evidence is conclusive on the sanity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.584" offset="2560885">It is simply one factor which the jury had a right to consider As I think is true in most jurisdictions, the jury has the right to disregard expert testimony, to give it whatever weight it deems is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.218" offset="2627445">In this case, what the jury thought they could do with the expert testimony after they heard it, we have defense psychiatrists, number one, who says this defendant was insane at the time of the offense, his is a paranoid schizophrenic, but there is absolutely no evidence that he is an antisocial personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.507" offset="2696513">Defense Psychiatrist Number 2 says we didn't know right from wrong at the time of the offense, but he is a paranoid schizophrenic, and he is an antisocial personality, keeping in mind the first psychiatrist had said there is no evidence of the antisocial personality, the state psychiatrist says, he knew right from wrong at the time of the offense, he was not a paranoid schizophrenic, there is no evidence of that in the record, he is an antisocial personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.559" offset="2808735">The two conditions are totally inconsistent, and each psychiatrist talks about the basis for their opinions and how they arrived at them.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.644" offset="2889087">One of the things I saw was his loosened associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.174" offset="2899223">He didn't... his responses to my questions were not logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.376" offset="2916046">His affect was flat.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.969" offset="2926390">This is some two months after the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.858" offset="2937989">The jury, having had benefit of the psychiatrists all explaining all of the different things they could consider, I think, could properly listen to the testimony as to the exchange that took place between Pilifont and Greenfield, and between Jolly and Greenfield, and give it whatever weight they thought was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.020" offset="3026596">We are in the somewhat unfortunate situation when we look at the relevancy question because, of course, there was no objection to the officer's testimony below.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.125" offset="3074975">The testimony... the objection that was registered for the closing argument was a comment on silence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.085" offset="12102893">Well, of course, the courts have never said that in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.989" offset="12114491">In response to Justice White's question, you say that of course when he once takes the stand he can be impeached completely by what he has said previously even if what he said previously is inadmissible in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.498" offset="12184500">That is certainly an impairment of an important constitutional right to testify, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.398" offset="12252104">And that is the common thread in the Harris v. New York case, in the Fletcher case, and in the Jenkins v. Anderson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.215" offset="12359415">And that is the example used in the footnote in Doyle, that if a man testifies and says, no, I told the police everything that I have just told you, and in fact he did remain silent, I think that is fair game for impeachment, and I don't think the Court addressed it specifically, but it surely suggested that that would be proper impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.923" offset="12454188">I think two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.078" offset="12470802">The first thing I have to say is yes, this Court's decision in this case does... would make a difference, looking at the Florida Supreme Court's Berwick decision, the whole opinion is fraught with analysis of the federal constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.525" offset="12536630">There is almost a parenthetical reference at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.962" offset="12550318">Oh, by the way, it violates the state constitution, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.741" offset="12565469">But the whole analysis--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3107.741" offset="12573515">Is it correct that in that case they construed the federal question the same way the Eleventh Circuit did?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann Carrison Paschall</label>
            <text syncTime="3113.035" offset="12594622">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.784" offset="12597652">I would liken the effect... in South Dakota versus Nevill this Court went on and addressed on the merits the issue that had been before the Court about the defendant's refusal, the use of the defendant's refusal to take a blood alcohol test even though the South Dakota Court had also said that it violated the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.447" offset="12696291">This Court in a footnote notes that the bulk of the analysis again in the state court opinion is federal constitutional analysis, that that is what had been addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.583" offset="12740803">That was what was addressed in Berwick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.894" offset="12750103">And further, we cannot say that the decision in Berwick would be such a change of law, you know, even if as to necessarily warrant relief at some later date for Mr. Greenfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.245" offset="12831500">For one thing, it might clarify the procedural default question once and for all if the state courts at some point have to determine whether the state constitution separately from the federal constitution was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.238" offset="12907464">The other point that I want to make is, we just can't in this case distinguish the evidence that came in of demeanor, of the yes, I want an attorney, no, I don't want to talk to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.838" offset="12985832">We can't say, well, some of this is admissible, it is fine, it is demeanor evidence, but the part which goes to silence is wrong, it shouldn't have been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.101" offset="13018955">I think if one looks at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion that Justice Rehnquist has been talking about today where they set out the quote at Pages A9 and 10 of the appendix to the cert petition, it is a lengthy quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.500" offset="13080500">In that whole section of the prosecutor's argument, the only portions of it that go to silence, there is a good portion of the argument, I do not want to speak to you, and then at the end of the argument, do you want to talk, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.806" offset="13149776">And again, he talked to the attorney, again he will not speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.977" offset="13166390">In that whole argument, those are the only references to silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.116" offset="13186975">In fact, the whole argument gets to that very point before there is ever any objection raised to the argument in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.253" offset="13223546">The Eleventh Circuit in finding that the error in this case was not harmless said it wasn't harmless because the prosecutor's argument was such a major portion of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.995" offset="13290524">I don't think that one can say if the court had been considering only the very brief references to silence, how that could not have been harmless error in the light of the testimony of officers, Pilifont and Jolly, in light of the thrust of the entire argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.318" offset="13355830">I think it is a reasonable conclusion that that is what the Eleventh Circuit was going to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.847" offset="13381953">They were attacking the whole line of argument that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.188" offset="13399298">In short, we would ask this Court to hold that where the only issue is a defendant's criminal responsibility at the time of the defense, that this post-Miranda behavior, including silence, can be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.227" offset="13471396">We would ask that you reverse the decision of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
