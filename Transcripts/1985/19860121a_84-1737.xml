            <text syncTime="77.500" offset="309917">The question here involves the taxability of profits derived by an otherwise tax-exempt professional association from the publication of commercial advertising in its monthly journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.963" offset="371775">The subset of the tax world that we're in here is the unrelated business income for UBI tax, which Congress enacted in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.536" offset="418064">Congress was spurred to enact that tax by the now-notorious acquisition by New York University of the Mueller Macaroni Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.156" offset="468532">NYU had managed to convince a federal court of appeals that its spaghetti profits should be immune from tax, on the theory that those profits were destined to fund NYU's educational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.025" offset="532062">Congress enacted the UBI tax in 1950 to insure that henceforth charities would pay tax on their profits from such unrelated business ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.722" offset="578873">Congress's main objective in doing that was to prevent unfair competition, that is, to prevent a tax-exempt group that runs a business from getting a competitive advantage in the form of a tax subsidy over its taxpaying competitors in the marketplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.802" offset="1047197">For this tax to apply, there'd have to be three conditions met.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.813" offset="1063184">There must be a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.329" offset="1069244">It must be regularly carried on, and the conduct of a trade or business must be unrelated to the accomplishment of the tax exempt purposes of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.090" offset="1112294">Now, the American College here has conceded that its publication of commercial advertising is a trade or business, and that it is regularly carried on by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.900" offset="1155553">The only question, therefore, is whether this advertising business is substantially related to the accomplishment of the respondent's educational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.894" offset="1195572">Respondent contends that it is related, on the theory that the ads it publishes help to educate the doctors who read the magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.000" offset="1231935">This contention is based on the fact that respondent does not publish general consumer advertising for things like Mercedes Benzes and margarine; rather, they advertise only products that are of professional interest to the doctors who read its magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.821" offset="1307272">These products are mainly prescription drugs, but also include non-prescription drugs like Tylenol and aspirin, medical products like support socks, and classified or help wanted advertisements for doctors in search of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.219" offset="1372787">The question is whether the publication of these advertisements is an educational activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.452" offset="1401731">In our view, the answer to this question is clearly provided by regulations promulgated by Treasury in 1967 to deal with this varied commercial advertising problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.466" offset="2049776">For example, the IRS has ruled that a company simply list its name with a bunch of other corporate patrons for charitable endeavor on a page in the magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.805" offset="2087184">That would not be commercial advertising because nothing's being advertised.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.870" offset="2227409">There can be other kinds of advertising outside that are not designed and selected in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.305" offset="2249143">Judge Kozinsky, for example, hypothesized a couple of ways a group might be able to run its advertising business differently, where it had much more input into the editing and arrangement of the ads.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.972" offset="2759784">Rule 82, 139, in which the tax authorities made an allocation between substantially related income and income that wasn't substantially related.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.573" offset="2838256">Well, I think, Justice Blackmun, in the case of the ABA Journal, I think... well, the bar journals, the allocation is based on divvying up the income between the editorial content which is furnished through subscriptions and dues, and the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.441" offset="2909727">I think all the advertising in the ABA Journal is unrelated business income because they advertise things like computers and trips to Bermuda and that kind of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.676" offset="3674697">And the hearings were commenced in '69 in the House, and the House announced at the beginning of the hearings that the purpose was to decide whether or not advertising should be unrelated to trade or business.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.515" offset="3878034">But, I think when Congress has held a week of hearings on them and looked at them in detail and endorsed them explicitly in their reports, it gives an added oomph to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.386" offset="3925473">It shows that Congress did not think they were inconsistent with the statute that Congress had enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.727" offset="3946893">Now, it's true, Congress only codified a portion of the regulations respecting fragmentation of a journal into advertising and editorial content.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.659" offset="3994540">It did not codify the example which speaks about advertising not being related activity, but if they'd approved that part of the regulations in the course of enacting the other thing, so although Congress has not codified the whole regulation, it has approved the entire regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.386" offset="4073535">And, we think that adds to the deference that should be shown to the Commissioners' construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.447" offset="4093701">In short, what Congress said is that, your Committee wants to make clear that such regulations are valid, so we think that this case really presents a very narrow question in view of this regulation which Congress has endorsed, and that is whether respondent's ads were designed and selected in the manner of ordinary commercial advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.834" offset="4279275">It found that any differences between respondent's ads and tax-paying Journal ads reflected the advertiser's marketing strategy rather than their probable importance to the reader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.876" offset="4331416">The Claims court found that respondent's advertising business was operated in material respects like the advertising business of any other publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.059" offset="4368196">Those companies willing to pay for space got it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.792" offset="4391079">The Claims Court found that respondent's rates were competitive with those charged by taxpaying medical journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.649" offset="4418560">It found that any educational function of respondent's ads was incidental to their purpose of raising revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.114" offset="4448444">It found that many of the products advertised, products like Valium, Tylenol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.909" offset="4471536">Darvon, Robitussin, insulin, aspirin and support hosiery were for established products and the ads were repeated from month to month following the normal commercial practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.387" offset="4525453">In short, the factual findings of the Claims Court make clear that respondent's ads, like those in Example 7, were designed and selected in the manner of ordinary commercial advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.570" offset="4578220">That means, under the regulation, that the publication of those ads can't be educational activity and therefore the ad revenues are subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.128" offset="4620434">And respondent's main argument in response to all this is that the regulation doesn't apply to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.311" offset="4653244">Respondent notes that in Example 7, the professional association that publishes the journal there is said to be tax-exempt under Section 501-C-6 which provides a tax exemption for business leagues and trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.883" offset="4723461">Respondent, although it is also a professional association, is organized instead as an educational organization under Section 501-C-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.489" offset="4761913">Respondent therefore argues that Example 7's principles should only apply to groups, to publishers who are tax-exempt under 501-C-6 and not to any other tax-exempt publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.935" offset="4819696">As we explain in more detail in our brief, this argument is wrong for at least three principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.308" offset="4849162">First of all, the IRS has always interpreted the principles of Example 7 to apply to tax exempt publishers across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.039" offset="4884062">There are rulings which explicitly apply to Example 7, to a 501-C-3 group, and this Court has held that the Commissioners' construction of its own regulation is entitled to deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.211" offset="5036826">I think that's exactly right, because respondent's argument would mean that the same ad run in the AMA Journal on the same day would be subject to tax because AMA is exempt under 501-C-6, but the ad in respondent's Journal appearing the same day would be tax exempt because it's under 501-C-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.624" offset="5118433">That does not make a whole lot of sense, because it would make the tax elective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.419" offset="5133584">As explained in our brief, although there are differences between 501-C-6 and C-3 groups at the margins, in the case of groups like respondent, that is, a professional association drawing its members from one profession, having very broad charitable, educational goals, they have basically an option of being organized either under 501-C-3 or under 501-C-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.378" offset="5233476">The main practical difference is that 501-C-6 groups can lobby in Congress and C-3 groups cannot, and that's one reason why they picked one rather than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.952" offset="5275794">And the fact that this option is available is made clear from the amicus briefs filed in this case, the AMA and the Mass Medical Society, both of which are medical associations that have the same purposes, educational purposes as respondent, but both organized under 501-C-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.381" offset="5349460">And, we think it would make no sense to construe the regulation to apply to one group of publishers and not the other because that would mean that essentially a 501-C-6 group could avoid this tax in its entirety by setting up a charitable affiliate and have it do the publishing, and Congress could not have meant that the tax could be avoided so easily because that would simply perpetuate the problem of unfair competition between taxpaying and tax-exempt publishers of medical and other specialized journals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.665" offset="5954560">The way this case started, the question was whether income from the advertisements in the scholarly journal of the American College of Physicians, organized for charitable purposes, is subject to the unrelated business income tax where the advertisement relates solely to the practice of internal medicine, are uniquely informative and are indisputably shown to contribute importantly to its exempt function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.432" offset="6101682">In this Court the question is narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.085" offset="6124251">In this Court the government is arguing that the College is precluded by a conclusive presumption with no foundation in the Code, the regulations or the legislative history from showing as a factual matter that its advertising activity contributes importantly to the exempt function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.420" offset="6213590">The Court of Appeals heard this as a factual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.478" offset="6257894">Now, in determining it we have a certain amount of confusion because of the name of the taxpayer, American College of Physicians, as Justice Blackmun understood, is quite old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.815" offset="6315259">The more modern term is internist, and you will find that in the literature they are used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.641" offset="6346501">Now, an internist is a medical doctor who treats the bodily ailments without surgery, largely, frequently, by the use of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.073" offset="6388193">Now, when we look to the Code we see that the key relationship in the statute is, does the activity contribute importantly to the exempt function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.743" offset="9658932">The incidental... the regulation says that there's an incidental benefit, that whatever educational value it is, is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.989" offset="9715879">Well, I think the point was made to the Justice a while ago, why wouldn't you publish them for free if it was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.406" offset="9761541">But we come back, the benefit here is not just incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.700" offset="9778782">The problem, the benefit is that it contributes substantially to making the internist... making it possible for the internist to better deliver medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.412" offset="9841580">Now, so we have one distinction with Example 7, which is whether it relates to the sort, the narrow type of drug advertising we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.627" offset="9882436">The second, which is extremely important, in spite of what petitioner says, it describes the organization there as a business league, a C-6 organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.607" offset="9938338">He pretends that there's no essential difference, but this Court has visited this question before, in the Better Business Bureau case 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.897" offset="9999569">This Court said, there is a clear demarcation for income tax purposes between a C-6 organization which is formed to advance the business interest of its members and a C-3 organization which is designed to serve the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.779" offset="10071040">Professor Bitger, article co-authored by Professor Bitger in the Yale Law Review, distinguishes them by saying that the C-3 is a public benefit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.354" offset="10125375">The C-6 is, among other groups, a mutual benefit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.224" offset="10152856">In National Muffler the Court by Justice Blackmun examined it and said, the exempt function of the C-6 is to advance the common business interest of the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.701" offset="10238746">In this instance the advertising, when it reaches Dr. Jones and serves to alert him when he is trying to prescribe for Mr. Smith, it serves to alert him to a possible palliative that he might not have known about, might have forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.081" offset="10356297">It tends to serve the exempt function by making him more effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.311" offset="10389211">That's a very vital function, and remember, the tax isn't on every business that's conducted by a charitable organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.119" offset="10444382">It's on an unrelated business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.492" offset="10453891">We hear the words "unfair competition", but as the Court remarked in a Louisiana Credit Association case, the draftsmen avoided that word like the plague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.565" offset="10502165">The statute says that if it's unrelated it's taxable, but if it's substantially related to the conduct of the exempt function, it is related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.794" offset="10559112">It is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.794" offset="10563082">It is not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.872" offset="10567471">In the 1969 Act, Congress did another balancing act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.116" offset="10616372">Professor Kaplan in his article in Columbia Law Review points out clearly that the UBIT has no consistent economic underpinning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.940" offset="10659736">It's a bunch of political compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.502" offset="10677917">The hearing, the announcement of the hearing, was that should all advertising income be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.326" offset="10713234">Congress didn't say that advertising activity shall be an unrelated trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.008" offset="10755971">We have the two exceptions that we know about that petitioner admitted to, and the third one that Justice Blackmun pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.051" offset="10788153">When Congress came out they said advertising in a journal will be measured as a separate activity, and the question is, does that activity contribute to the exempt function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.670" offset="10862655">Not many advertising activities will meet this standard, but when the House report came out at 26 it says, we have taken this action and under it the tax... the advertising activity may... may be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.144" offset="10952516">The word "may" fairly has a connotation of "may not".</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.784" offset="10971115">Now, the report goes ahead to say, well, ordinarily, generally, we anticipate that the advertising income will be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.795" offset="11019180">I quite agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.840" offset="11023360">It's unusual advertising activity that rises to the dignity of contributing importantly to the exempt function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.850" offset="11071321">But in this Court the petitioner is arguing that we should be precluded by a rule of law, conclusive presumption, from showing that our advertising activity does so contribute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.157" offset="11292526">But there was a second line, that if they held fragmentation was valid, there was a question of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.489" offset="13713868">It says that it's not educational if its commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.302" offset="13721182">That's the problem, and the Claims... the Federal Circuit never even mentioned the regulation we argued was controlling to it.</text>
