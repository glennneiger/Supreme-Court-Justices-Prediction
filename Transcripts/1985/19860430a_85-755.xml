            <text syncTime="64.340" offset="386134">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="401285">This is a direct appeal taken from an original probate action in west Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.564" offset="434931">The Appellant was denied inheritance rights from her father on the basis that she was an illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.706" offset="471503">Three questions are presented: first of all, whether this Court's decision in Triable v. Gordon is binding authority where the father died before Trimble was decided and suit was filed afterwards in his open estate; second, whether any sufficient state interest supports enforcement of the naked status of bastardy after the father's death; and third, whether the preference of surviving fathers over surviving mothers is substantially related to any sufficient state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="624685">The Appellant in this case is Delynda Ann Ricker Barker Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.385" offset="650285">The Christian names Delynda Ann were chosen for her by her natural father, Prince Ricker, whose surname she had until she was adopted about the time she started elementary school, by Jerry Barker.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.209" offset="701589">The Reed is her married name.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.642" offset="711307">The procedural posture of this case is particularly relevant because we are talking about whether the application of a decision of this Court is defeated by that posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.219" offset="761566">This was from an order entered in open probate on which there were five other children of Prince Ricker and the Appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.324" offset="802004">The order excluded the Appellant Delynda from the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.561" offset="823006">The probate of that estate is still going on in open administration in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.798" offset="843904">There has never been an order entered declaring who the heirs are to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.786" offset="867832">There has never been an order entered on which any third parties would rely stating who the heirs are.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.190" offset="893432">The probate is still open.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.056" offset="900956">The assets have not been vested by a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.642" offset="911300">In this posture, full precedential authority should be given to the case of Trimble v. Gordon because the statute involved in this case is an insurmountable barrier indistinguishable from the insurmountable barrier struck down in Trimble, and because the estate is still open.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.081" offset="1249011">So there have been at least two state court rulings on this particular 1956 statute as applicable to persons... estates of persons who died before--</text>

            <text syncTime="531.677" offset="2255457">Also, the Family Code gave the right to attorneys fees to a child born late enough who brought suit soon enough, and that's a valuable due process right because the state imposes on illegitimate children a requirement of proving paternity, does not impose the same requirement on a legitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.157" offset="2333302">The legitimate child just shows motherhood and marriage, never has to show access, chastity of the mother, that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.240" offset="4109733">We are going... the only way to recognize the fairness interest is to allow inheritance, and that can be done in this case because the estate is open, without jeopardizing orderly probate and without jeopardizing security of title to land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.142" offset="4829249">Under Section 109 of the Probate Code, a surviving parent is automatically the guardian of the child's person and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.314" offset="4866030">The mother would be the guardian, the father would be the guardian, but if the mother is the guardian, the child has no estate that could help her to raise the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2469.771" offset="10007764">They are reasonable efforts to bar spurious claims and to secure accuracy in titles and accuracies in inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.460" offset="10038588">There is nothing invidious or discriminatory about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.145" offset="10057292">The law was in place for her to establish if she could her paternal inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.922" offset="10116433">She did not even make an effort to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.808" offset="10132002">All in the world she chose to do was to say am I the child of Prince Ricker, which was a nonissue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.116" offset="10185187">Now, we would submit that we don't know what Texas could have done to come into compliance with Trimble other than what she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.256" offset="10237746">Now, would Texas, would the statute, would Section 42(b) as it existed in 1955 have been in violation of Trimble?</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.683" offset="10291454">It was more liberal than the Illinois statute which required not only intermarriage but also a formal acknowledgement of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.091" offset="10349132">Texas tried every way in the world to come into compliance with those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.929" offset="10380479">Now, then, are we to say that while in court in 1982 with the case already on file since 1978, with her lawyers and not make an effort to comply with the law, and say, well, the statute has run on me, or I don't like the law, I don't think the legislature was proper in requiring these scientific tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.334" offset="10514017">Are we to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.186" offset="10521436">I would respectfully urge the Court that there is a complete lack of substantiality in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.910" offset="10568352">We do not find in the lawsuit anything that says that the Texas laws should not be applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.187" offset="10629478">Texas laws are presumed to take effect at the time that they are enacted, and these did, and one month after Trimble and two years after Trimble again, both while she was in court and able to take full advantage of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.766" offset="10707741">We would respectfully urge, Your Honor, that in this case the appeal should be dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.870" offset="10828218">Your Honor, the Winn action, which recognized the invalidity of the date of birth provision, has never been applied in Texas to recognize anything other than the right of child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.029" offset="10888822">It was not the equivalent, it has never given the equivalent relief available under the Family Code action, it has never given legitimation, it has never given attorneys fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.741" offset="10955695">Delynda filed this action before she was 22, so if this is a Winn action in Probate, which would be a Trimble action, we're within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.113" offset="10997178">The Court had before it in Mills all three methods which the Appellees now claim were sufficient reasons for denying inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.171" offset="11045452">Mills rejected voluntary child support by the father as a sufficient means for child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.658" offset="11071365">It rejected the one-year statute which gave the claimant in Mills a much better chance to get child support than we have had to be legitimated in this case, and in Mills it rejected marriage, which is the third of the methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.651" offset="11123297">These are... these methods have already been considered by the Court and rejected as not constitutionally sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.907" offset="11268329">Your Honor, I would think that the first time that Texas allowed it would be in 1977 because the voluntary legitimation for support purposes was enacted right after Gomez in '73.</text>
