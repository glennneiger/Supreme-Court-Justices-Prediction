            <text syncTime="61.523" offset="389777">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.021" offset="399704">This case presents the question whether a federal statute which creates a new legal obligation requiring one private party to pay money to another private party takes property in violation of the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="454666">This statute, known as ERISA, enacted in 1974, as amended in 1980, requires an employer who ceases participation in a multiemployer pension trust to pay money to the pension trust in amounts computed according to the statute as withdrawal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.447" offset="525405">The essential undisputed fact in this case is that absent the statute imposing the obligation, the employer otherwise would have no obligation to pay money to the pension trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.004" offset="575665">Under the statute, the obligation to pay the money as withdrawal liability is triggered when the employer withdraws or ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the pension trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.234" offset="624566">Now, in practice and in the case before this Court, this means that the employer has failed to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement requiring a continued contribution into the pension trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.995" offset="675662">Therefore, in effect, if there is no ability to arrive at a consensual agreement between the union and the employer which includes continued contributions into the pension trust, the withdrawal liability taking of property is triggered.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.419" offset="945350">To get back to your original point, the statutory interpretation in effect was resolved against us before the 1980 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.151" offset="980249">When the 1980 amendment was passed, it made clear that Congress did intend to include this type of plan under its statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.434" offset="2221379">The first event was the termination of the plan, and under the statute, Sections 4041 and 4042, there are two ways basically in which the plan can be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.507" offset="2261712">It can be terminated voluntarily by the trustees administering the plan or it can be forceably terminated by the PBGC through certain procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.034" offset="2299746">That certainly is not subject to control by the individual employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.080" offset="2315942">The second event is, after the termination the PBGC under the '74 statute had the discretion to guarantee the benefits, and if it did and if there was any need for additional funds they would assess the employer and he had to pay it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.683" offset="2382398">So both of those events were completely outside of the control of the employer to effect whether or not his property would be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.194" offset="2408416">We come then to the 1980 circumstance, and we have still a statute, as this Court determined in the R.A. Gray case, that Congress did not permit an opportunity for the employer to decide whether he would or would not continue in the pension plan under this new circumstance in which the statute imposes the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.311" offset="2504860">Under that circumstance, there was never a hiatus period allowing the employer to withdraw from the plan before this new liability came into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.104" offset="2544044">And as a matter of fact, as P.A. Gray said, they wanted to make sure he didn't have that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.054" offset="2563897">So we cannot have under the statute at any time since the enactment date in '74 any point at which there is a consensual opportunity for the employer to agree to the taking of his property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard M. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="1121.237" offset="4628615">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.846" offset="4643035">I stand here before you representing the employer, Woodward Sand, in his case, and I would like to point out to the Court, which is pointed out in the footnotes to our brief, that at the beginning of this proceeding I represented three other additional employers and the total liability assessed against them by this pension fund approached a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.291" offset="4720775">It is correct that Mr. Jett stated the liability that has now finally been determined by Woodward Sand under the arbitration procedure is $201,000, and the period of 30 days which the trust fund could have had to review that number has now passed and there was no review being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.250" offset="4800605">So that is a right number in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.984" offset="4811577">I would like to emphasize to the Court that in this case there are three parties to the scenario, not two, as the Government's brief would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.074" offset="4851910">There is the pension fund, there is the union, and there is the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.916" offset="4871345">In cases where property is completely expropriated and transferred to another property or the Government, the Court has really looked at two themes in determining whether there has been a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.378" offset="4929128">One, has the property been completely transferred and extinguished, which is what occurred in this case, because the employer pays all money over to the trust fund within 60 days of the time the claim is made, even before there's a final adjudication on the accurate amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.232" offset="4988582">And secondly, that money is being put to Government-directed use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.496" offset="5009585">This is not a situation where, like in the Eagle Feathers case, there's a statute passed and there is no longer much value to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.758" offset="5042708">The property is actually being taken, given to another private person, and the Government has directed the particular use of that property, which is paying for pension funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.390" offset="5273213">I'd like to point out to the Court that in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies the Court pointed out that there was merely a contract right in the claimant to the interest that had been deposited in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.839" offset="5323054">The claimants themselves did not have in their possession the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.118" offset="5340086">And that's very similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.648" offset="5350222">What we're asking the Court to do is look past the general statement of obligation and lock at the fact that there is money there: personalty, realty, goodwill, the entire bundle of rights of the employer, with unlimited liability, that can he expropriated from the employer based upon past acts and some future acts which are beyond the employer's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.107" offset="5448128">It's very important for this Court, I believe, to keep in mind its decision in Amax Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.011" offset="5471743">Very recently, this Court has stated that trustees of union pension funds are solely responsible for the funding of pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.523" offset="5505702">Even without the disclaimer clause in this case, prior to the enactment of this scheme there was no liability on the part of the employers because there was no promise, other than their good faith promise in collective bargaining agreement to pay the level of contributions which they agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.047" offset="5575815">Throughout the Government's brief, there is an underlying theme of blame here, and that is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.623" offset="5606117">The employers are not to blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.231" offset="5616566">There are two things going on with this statute, both of which the Government I believe directs towards the employer in justifying that goodness and fairness somehow ought to be imposed, should impose the liability on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.601" offset="5670065">One is the withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.193" offset="5676439">Mr. Jett has ably pointed out that withdrawal is often beyond the control of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.785" offset="5698800">In fact, the lower courts in the Ninth Circuit in the Thompson Building Materials case, in the Pacific Iron and Metal case, which are cited in the brief, point out that most withdrawals are involuntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.464" offset="5773510">And I'd like to point out, as Mr. Jett did, that all terms and conditions of an agreement relative to contributing to the pension fund, which really establishes the level of contributions, could be agreed upon and yet, if the union is asking for a five dollar an hour wage increase, impasse is reached, and the withdrawal liability is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.113" offset="5860132">That can hardly be blamed on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.268" offset="5868700">By the same token, the underfunding which is the real problem in this case, not the employer's withdrawal, the underfunding has been in the exclusive control of the trustees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.295" offset="5916870">Well, nevertheless, I suppose that if you can't reach an agreement with the union at the next bargaining time and there's an impasse, would the entire withdrawal lability be assessed if you said: Look, I'm willing to go right ahead and make the payments based on what I have been paying.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.190" offset="6028360">Section 302(c)(5) requires that a written agreement between the union and the employer exist in order for the employer to have a right to make those contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.265" offset="6068693">So that by operation of law, regardless of the desires of the employer to continue, he has withdrawn and the potentially debilitating withdrawal liability is assessed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.870" offset="6107146">The Government argues throughout its brief that this case should be decided on due process rationality grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.274" offset="6136716">It asserts that this law is needed very badly by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.413" offset="6153330">It asserts that pensions are very good and underfunding is a real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.441" offset="6169422">And it asserts that the Government really can't afford this program and somebody ought to pay for it, and let's make the employers do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.298" offset="6196798">Well, I submit to you you have faced these arguments many, many times before and rejected them on every occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.936" offset="6231384">The Government's inability to afford a program is not a justification for a taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.578" offset="7165941">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.309" offset="7200840">We will make two arguments this afternoon: first, that the taking clause simply does not apply to the Multiemployer Act; and secondly, that even if this statute does implicate the taking clause, that it meets any and all of the tests articulated by this Court in resolving taking clause questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.142" offset="7300210">Now, our threshold position is that the taking clause has never been thought to apply to socioeconomic legislation which simply imposes a liability on one party to compensate another party for the harm or potential harm that he causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.976" offset="7391534">This Court decided in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation versus R.A. Gray in 1984 that the Multiemployer Act... and I quote from the Court's opinion...</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.817" offset="7438868">"merely requires a withdrawing employer to compensate a pension plan for benefits that have already vested with the employees at the time of the employer's withdrawal. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.045" offset="7491844">Using the words of the Fifth Amendment, private property is simply not being taken for the public use without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.714" offset="7534476">When the Congress requires withdrawing employers to pay for the consequences of their own conduct, no taking clause violation is implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.613" offset="7590065">Now, this is precisely the kind of compensatory statute to which the taking clause should not be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.111" offset="7768115">And under those circumstances, to suggest that we have specific identifiable property, as Justice O'Connor's questions were going to that particular point, in this case is illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.668" offset="7826316">We have, to return to the Chief Justice's question, simply an inchoate business decision, and that does not implicate property insofar as the taking clause is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.782" offset="8082734">Quite the contrary, in this particular case we have a trust in which there are equal numbers of employer and employee representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.771" offset="8666728">However, I would point out an ameliorative provision which tempers that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.582" offset="8685954">It is Section 4225 of the statute, which, when an employer liquidates his business, there is a sliding scale which allows the withdrawal liability to be reduced to a tremendous degree under that particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.231" offset="8752618">But assuming for the moment that Section 4225 does not alleviate the problem in its entirety, we return to the basic notion, and that is these are liabilities, as this Court pointed out in the PBGC versus R.A.

            <text syncTime="2172.816" offset="8834956">And those liabilities, regardless of whether his withdrawal from the plan is voluntary or involuntary, those are liabilities which in the first instance under the taking clause should be tested be a justice and fairness standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.805" offset="8934848">Supposing Congress, in one of its socioeconomic moods that you refer to, when it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 said: You know, we're laying down minimum wages now, but we're really offended by what these businesses have been paying workers in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.706" offset="9002453">So another provision they add, that wasn't in the bill they actually passed but in my hypothetical: That you pay minimum wages for the last five years, even though, regardless of what your contract was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.857" offset="9047071">Now, is that just one of these socioeconomic things that adjusts burdens and benefits of economic life, and if it's rational it's okay?</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.289" offset="9100778">That is precisely the kind of statute where the employer, the current employer, was required to pay for the ills retroactively created in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.645" offset="9138186">And I might add, Your Honor, that insofar the Turner Elkhorn statute was concerned, it was the last employer in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.985" offset="9171622">I.e., an employee could have worked for an employer for 30 years and been exposed to coal dust in the mines, and for his last year worked for a different employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.792" offset="9218852">It is that different employer for whom he worked for one year who must pay the entire liability of black lung.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.229" offset="9528560">And consequently, in order to judge this statute in terms of its entirety... and that's why rationality should be the touchstone of judging a statute from stem to stern... it seems to me that under those circumstances the Court should take into consideration all of the ameliorative provisions in this statute before it can strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.127" offset="9620197">Now, assuming arguendo that, as Appellants claim, the taking clause does apply in this case, we submit that basic notions of justice, of fairness, have informed this Court's analysis, and under those notions the Multiemployer Act is clearly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.790" offset="9714760">As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her colloquy with Mr. Freeman, the predominant question under the taking clause is whether withdrawing employers have been arbitrarily singled out to share the costs... and I emphasize, share the costs, because as one court put it, the pain is indeed spread around among participants and among withdrawing employers, as well as those that pay premiums, and remaining employers, those who continue to contribute to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.464" offset="9853523">The question is whether withdrawing employers have been singled out to share those costs of maintaining pension plan stability, and I return to this Court's opinion in the R.A. Gray case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.798" offset="9942862">Well, we recognize, of course, that the standing issue is certainly the primary difficulty of the Appellants rather than the Appellees in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.262" offset="9988733">However, on balance we feel that the trustees do have standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.151" offset="10016213">The trustees have alleged... we believe their allegations do not rise to the level of constitutional significance, but they have alleged that certain kinds of harm which they feel are triggered by withdrawal liability endanger or may endanger new employers from joining the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.595" offset="10102000">They may endanger ultimate pension plan viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.483" offset="10117568">Now, that allegation is contrary to the findings of Congress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.466" offset="10133555">However, it seems to me that that basis allegation is probably sufficient, and I point the Court to a footnote in Andrus versus Allard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.118" offset="10180158">It's footnote 21, in which the Court faced a similar, not on all fours, but a similar kind of standing difficulty, and overcame I believe that particular standing difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.019" offset="10223730">It seems to me that that's sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.910" offset="10231253">We do, however, in response to Justice O'Connor's initial questioning, we do however insist that Woodward Sand has no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.109" offset="10260093">And contrary to the representations made by Woodward Sand in this particular case, they have very deftly preserved the argument that they owe no withdrawal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.058" offset="10311920">And they have suggested in their briefs that they may have withdrawn prior to the enactment date of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.165" offset="10340341">If that allegation is so, they owe nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.396" offset="10353193">Similarly, the allegations of a million dollars insofar as the totality of liability owed by all the four withdrawing employers who began this case, that allegation must be taken with a salt shaker, because in point of fact the trustees have told the other three employers in this case that they owe nothing because they withdrew prior to the enactment date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.715" offset="10450473">Under these circumstances, we really do not have before the Court, it seems to me, a viable withdrawing employer challenging this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.493" offset="10485582">Standing, however, is preserved to proceed in this case insofar as the trustees are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.382" offset="10509196">Returning to the taking clause question, let me remind the Court what it said in PBGC versus Gray, and there the Court concluded that if withdrawal liability were not exacted from withdrawing employers, those employers that remain in the plan would have to increase their contributions to cover the liabilities that withdrawing employers, be they voluntary or involuntary, Justice O'Connor, those remaining employers would have to increase their contributions in order to cover the liabilities that withdrawing employers leave behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.301" offset="10672827">The Court also concluded in PBGC versus Gray that withdrawals could ultimately affect plan stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.876" offset="10707204">Accordingly, the costs which Congress linked to employer withdrawals should be borne, not by the public as a whole, nor by remaining employers, but indeed we suggest by those that withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.650" offset="10778257">Withdrawing employers are not like the homeowner who happens to be in the path accidentally of the public's highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.225" offset="10820576">Typically, takings involve the transfer of property between unrelated parties or between a private party and the government acting in its entrepreneurial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.156" offset="10880240">Here, on the other hand, Congress concluded that employers who withdraw from multiemployer plans should continue their pension funding obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.824" offset="10926946">They, after all, have received the benefit of their bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.776" offset="11090786">Now, this kind of a compensatory statute clearly meets this Court's often articulated justice and fairness rule under the takings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.082" offset="11143972">In Andrus versus Allard, for example, the Court said:</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.925" offset="11155361">"Suffice it to say that Government regulation by definition involves the adjustment of rights for the public good. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.452" offset="11193500">"Often this adjustment curtails some potential use or economic exploitation of private property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.012" offset="11223697">"To require compensation in all such circumstances would effectively compel the Government to regulate by purchase. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.227" offset="11256612">It seems to me that that language in that case applies with special force to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.506" offset="11285660">As part of this Court's consideration of justice and fairness, it has further articulated three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.377" offset="11329128">They are the character of the Government's action, the economic impact of regulation, and the interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.449" offset="11377402">Those three factors appear to infuse this Court's notions of justice and fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.870" offset="11399136">First, the character of the Government's action in this case does not amount to a governmental appropriation or a physical occupation, as in Loretto versus Teleprompter or as in Penn Central versus City of New York, where the Court observed that a taking is more readily found when the Government physically invades than when interference arises from a public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.928" offset="13927371">I would say first, Turner Elkhorn and R.A. Gray both were cases that answered only due process issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.987" offset="13955583">They did not involve the taking clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.892" offset="13959240">The only thing they have to say about a taking clause issue is that there was a deprivation of property there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.406" offset="13977317">Now, in terms of whether there's a different type of property for due process and the taking clause, they appear in the same Fifth Amendment and they don't change the type of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.762" offset="14014724">There is no state, and that would decide that money certainly not this Court, that money is not property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.354" offset="14037085">And in fact, the taking clause in its very essence was intended as a prohibition against Government action taking wealth from one minority party and transferring it to someone favored by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.161" offset="14088285">It was intended first and foremost as a protection of minority rights against oppression by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.455" offset="14117438">And if we look to any of the issues that have been raised by PPGC... rationality, ameliorating provisions, whether the statute is precisely suited to the regulatory purpose, whether it's fair... every one of those arguments has no protection for minority rights.</text>
