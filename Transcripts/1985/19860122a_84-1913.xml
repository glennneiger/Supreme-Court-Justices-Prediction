            <text syncTime="9.372" offset="171531">Mr. Lee, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="18.295" stopTime="625.892">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="18.295" offset="207267">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in our view this is a simple case that requires a simple solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.000" offset="250108">The only reason the case is here is that the Court of Appeals committed an error which not even the respondents defend, and all that this Court need do and all that it should do is to reverse that error and remand the case so that the lower courts can perform the task that is properly theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.497" offset="324086">There is one question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.597" offset="332446">It concerns the correctness of the Seventh Circuit's holding that there is an exception to the foundational principal that before requiring arbitration of a collective bargaining agreement, the Court must first determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="393886">In the Court of Appeals' view, the exception exists where the judge in order to decide whether there has been a promise to arbitrate, would have to consider any provision of the contract other than the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.583" offset="452400">The issue arose here because the petitioner laid off 79 installers at its Chicago based location.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.237" offset="474970">The union claims that Article 20 of the collective bargaining agreement makes these layoffs arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="500152">The company's answer is that Article 20 does not change Article 9's exclusion of all layoff decisions from issues that are to be arbitrated, and the company places particular emphasis on a prior judicial interpretation of this contract and other bargaining history.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.135" offset="562637">Now, under those circumstances, were the parties in disagreement over whether there had been a promise to arbitrate?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.658" offset="600671">What the lower courts should have done and what both parties and all three amici agreed that the lower courts should have done was to give the parties their judgment on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.835" offset="657409">The issue is arbitrability, arbitrability is for the courts, and these courts should have decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.405" offset="683740">Had they done so, then no matter which way they decided it, this would have been in respondent's words a thoroughly uneventful case involving nothing more than the interpretation of one labor contract and eminently unworthy of review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.998" offset="746016">But that is not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.833" offset="753435">Both the District Court and also the Court of Appeals would have sent the case directly to the arbitrator without performing their threshold duty of deciding whether the party ever intended this issue to be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.726" offset="809024">The Seventh Circuit's view, this sidestepping of what it conceded was its normal duty, was required because of the interaction of two features of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.149" offset="850715">First, the parties have not clearly excluded the arbitrability issue from arbitration, and second, in order to determine arbitrability, the Court would have to consider not just the arbitration clause, Article VIII, but also two what the Court called substantive clauses, Articles IX and XX.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.647" offset="944651">That decision is hopelessly inconsistent with this Court's holdings and opinions and also with the policy of encouraging arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.237" offset="979028">I would like to examine just briefly each part of the lower court's two-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.341" offset="999404">The first is that the parties have not clearly excluded the arbitrability issue from arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.028" offset="1022183">That is just a flat misstatement of well settled law concerning who decides arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.998" offset="1050082">This Court said in Warrier and Gulf not only that the Court decides arbitrability, but It went further and clarified the question of jurisdiction of the arbitrator will not be left to the arbitrator unless, and this is a quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="242.341" offset="1103476">"the claimant bears the burden of a clear demonstration of that purpose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="248.045" offset="1126255">The Court of Appeals ruling in this respect simply confuses the presumption of arbitrability with the question of who decides arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.451" offset="1171917">Warrier and Gulf deals with both of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.936" offset="1181843">When the question is whether it is viewed as arbitrary, then the scales are weighted in favor of arbitration, but when the question is, who decides arbitrability, they are weighted in favor of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.076" offset="1230326">But it is the second part of the test that really demonstrates the mischief of the Court of Appeals' error.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.116" offset="1258539">It is disputed by no one that one of the main reasons over the past quarter-century since the Trilogy arbitration has gained such widespread acceptance in the labor field and has become so successful, is that following this Courts unequivocal assurance in Warrier and Gulf that the question of arbitrability is for the courts, employers have been willing to use arbitration because they have known that where it is really important for them to exclude a management function, or some other subject from arbitration, their agreements will be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.722" offset="1404929">They know that the scales are weighted in favor of arbitrability, but they also know that they are judicial scales, and the presumption is not an irrebuttable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.247" offset="1447038">If their case for exclusion is strong enough, then a judge will keep the issue from ever going to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.984" offset="1473997">Now, common sense teaches that when the courts perform this pivotal task, they must consider whatever provisions of the contract and whatever elements of bargaining history they can find that shed any light on the issue whether there has been a promise to arbitrate, as this Court clarified in American Manufacturing, and as clarified even better by Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Warrier and Gulf and American manufacturing even more than the interpretation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.274" offset="1619133">The words in a collective bargaining agreement are not to be interpreted in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.828" offset="1641389">They can only he understood against their background and as parts of the entire contract, so that properly interpreted, there is no tension between the two basic principals of Warrier and Gulf that the Court decides arbitrability and the arbitrator decides the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.839" offset="1709412">They are parts of a single whole principle, and that whole goes to the parties' freedom of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.661" offset="1744730">The respondents contend here, as they have contended at every stage of litigation, that what petitioner is really asking for is an interpretation of the substantive meaning of Article 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.086" offset="1790392">It is a confusing argument, but at bottom it is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.073" offset="1814320">What we want out of this case is a judicial ruling on whether the entire contract in light of its entire historical background excludes layoffs from arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.116" offset="1870535">Does this involve interpretation of the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="436.132" offset="1878581">Of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.401" offset="1883701">There is simply no way that a judge can decide whether the parties have contracted for arbitration without interpreting the contract, but the judge and the arbitrator interpret for quite different purposes, and they ask quite different questions, and this brings me to what I submit is really the key to this Court's solution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.832" offset="1969383">It is a careful distinction among three quite separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.002" offset="1994042">The ultimate issue in this case is whether the company could lay off the installers in Chicago when there was no lack of work in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.543" offset="2040227">That issue, if arbitrable, is the arbitrator's issue, and no one has attempted to litigate that in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.382" offset="2075649">There was neither evidence nor argument put forth before either the District Court or the Court of Appeals on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.686" offset="2100831">A second quite separate issue is whether the parties have promised to arbitrate this merits issue concerning layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.692" offset="2136880">That was the question that was presented to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.627" offset="2148583">That is the question they should have decided, and that is the question that ought to be remanded to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.815" offset="2169376">Now, a third, again quite separate question is the question presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.284" offset="2199260">Can a judge in considering arbitrability consider any provisions of the contract other than the arbitration clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="524.790" offset="2233220">And the key to this case, I submit, is for this Court simply to decide its question and then remand the case to the lower courts to decide arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.065" offset="2274284">What no one at this bar is urging is that this Court should simply agree with the Seventh Circuit that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.356" offset="2319528">The respondents do, however, suggest two possible bases for affirmance of the Seventh Circuit's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.310" offset="2351293">Let me deal with each of those just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.263" offset="2367175">They suggest first that the Court of Appeals really made findings which would support a holding of arbitrability, and in the alternative they suggest that the lower courts may have been using the word 301 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.827" offset="2453380">Those contentions simply miss the point entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.896" offset="2469680">Whether the word "arbitrability" has one meaning or two or four is quite irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.469" offset="2495907">The controlling fact is that we contend that the parties have agreed that disputes over layoffs are not to be decided by an arbitrator, and this one is no different, and that is what the parties have contracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.292" offset="2551286">We think we are right on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.178" offset="2558810">We think the language of the contract and the bargaining history squarely support us.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.580" offset="2576364">The union, on the other hand, thinks we are wrong, and the union also relies on bargaining history.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.584" offset="2596426">But right or wrong, we are entitled to our day in court on that issue, and to date we have not had our day in court on that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.729" offset="3076975">With respect to the question of whether there was authority to lay... whether the company did or did not have power to lay off workers at a Chicago location where there was no lack of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.973" offset="3133922">You would look at certain provisions of the contract, and you would be looking for matters in the contract that were related to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.328" offset="3179375">Here, by contrast, the evidence that was put forth before the Seventh Circuit was first of all the language of Article IX which says that management functions are not to be arbitrated, and then there is the question of whether Article XX overrides that, but even more was the matter of this New York Court of Appeals judicial decision which said that under this particular contract, or at least the predecessor of it, all layoff decisions, all termination of employment decisions are non-arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.000" offset="3306121">Following that, the bargaining history shows, and it is set for in the record, and indeed in the joint appendix in this case, that the parties went into bargaining of a new contract within months after that decision came down, and the union insisted on, in effect, overruling that New York Court of Appeals decision, and they succeeded partially.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.315" offset="3403296">They identified three... excuse me, four separate types of termination decisions, and in Article XXII of the contract, Article XXII of the contract makes discharges, dropping and relieving, subject to arbitration, but not layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.141" offset="3470588">Now, those are the kinds of issues that would be considered in connection with whether it was arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.995" offset="3490023">They would have nothing to do with the issue whether there was or was not a right to lay off when there was not... very often there is a real temptation to confuse those two issues, and that is why you have a split in the circuits on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.706" offset="3556896">But I think at the end of the day if you ask yourself that kind of evidence is it that is really relevant to the ultimate merits issue and what kind of evidence and what kind of arguments is it that is relevant to whether the parties intended that issue to be arbitrated, they are usually quite separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.068" offset="3634323">Now, I will say that this Court did say in Warrier and Gulf that it may be necessary on occasion in considering, in the discharge of the judge's responsibility--</text>

            <text syncTime="944.564" offset="3912371">Well, they of course point but first of all that what the Seventh Circuit did was a dangerous position.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.854" offset="3945494">Then they urge basically that there are four possible different meanings of the word "arbitrability", and they urge that we ought no longer to use the word "arbitrability" in connection with... meaning the jurisdiction of the arbitrators which is to be decided by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.202" offset="4042878">My response to that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.321" offset="4055313">The first is, I think it is unnecessary, quite unnecessary to the decision in this case, because regardless of whether that phrase has one meaning or three or for, the fact of the matter is, we have never had a judicial decision on whether these parties intended this dispute to be arbitrated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.085" offset="4138382">And finally, I think it would be a bad idea and the reason it would be a bad idea is that over the years the word "arbitrability" has become a word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.873" offset="4173595">You look through this Court's decisions, every one of them since Warrier and Gulf, and it is used as meaning, the judgment that a court makes to determine whether or not the arbitrator has jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.254" offset="4251126">Well, basically the substance of their position is similar to Mr. Gold's, and that is that you can interpret from some of the words that the lower court used that it perhaps did decide the arbitrability issue, and my answer to that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.867" offset="4341510">The first is, I don't think there is any way that in any objective reading of the Seventh Circuit's opinion you can conclude that that court did give us the judicial judgment to which we are entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.481" offset="4416011">If that court had decided arbitrability, there would have been no reason to label its holding an exception to the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.101" offset="4446522">If it had decided arbitrability, then it would not have needed to make the candid confession that what it did was inconsistent with Wiley and Sons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.440" offset="4479855">If it had decided arbitrability, it would not have needed to say that the District Court properly eluded consideration of parole evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.829" offset="4517366">And certainly if it had decided arbitrability it would not have ordered that the company is ordered to arbitrate the arbitrability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.920" offset="4561775">But in any event, even if I am wrong on that, certainly at the very least that question is a serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.247" offset="4619035">The Seventh Circuit's error that everyone agrees on needs to be corrected, and the case needs to be sent back to the Seventh Circuit, and if it is correct that the Seventh Circuit remanded something that I cannot believe their opinion did, then there will be ample opportunity on that occasion for them to say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.830" offset="4937415">And in order to evaluate that claim, it seems to me one has to in a bit more detail than petitioners do and with a closer attention to the nature of the case determine what under this Court's precedence the lower courts were required to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.881" offset="5761631">With all those Preliminaries and kind words for the former Solicitor General, on Page 9 of our brief, the red brief, we set but Article VIII of the contract, and Article VIII is entitled to arbitration, and it says if the national union and the company fail to settle by negotiation any differences arising with respect to tie interpretation of this contract or the performance of an obligation hereunder, such differences shall, provided that such dispute is not excluded from arbitration by other provisions of this contract, and provided that the grievance procedures as to such disputes have been exhausted, be referred upon written demand of either party to an impartial arbitrator mutually agreed to by both parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.742" offset="6041037">By its term, any difference between the parties is subject to arbitration, and there is a proviso that there are provisions in the contract which exclude disputes which would otherwise be subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.453" offset="6111881">And we note some express exclusions, none of which the company relies on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.309" offset="6147303">Rather, in its answer, and at least until the reply brief to this Court, the company put it money on Article IX of the agreement, which we set out at Page 11 of our brief with different emphasis than in the company's brief, but otherwise word for word as it is in the contract, and that provision in its pertinent parts says that the union recognizes the right of the company subject to the limitations contained in the provisions of this contract but otherwise not subject to the provisions of the arbitration clause to exercise the functions of managing the business which involve, among other things, the termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.273" offset="6347192">Now, the underlying claim by the union here is that Article XX of the agreement which we had set out earlier in our brief and is also set out in the joint appendix which provides that when lack of work necessitates layoffs there will be layoffs in a certain way is a limitation on what management can do in managing a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.044" offset="6470281">The provision requires that there be a lack of work at a particular place for management to be able to lay people off, and so the union's grievance here is predicated on Article XX, substantive provision which on its face can be read to limit what management does, and it is our view that that being so, Article IX cannot possibly be read as an express exclusion from the broad arbitration provision of Article VIII.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.324" offset="8407417">That is in the final... the very phrasing of the test indicates that is not a final determination, and in Warrier and Gulf on remand to the arbitrator the arbitrator made, for want of a better term, an arbitrability determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.886" offset="11281618">The dispute in In Re Western Electric and the New York courts pertained to Article XXII, which had to do with disciplinary actions by the company, and the method of the trial judge in New York was to evaluate whether there was anything in Article XXII which the union was relying on which provided a basis for a meritorious grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.421" offset="11399796">So, his method is exact... and he relied on Cutlet Hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.442" offset="11415887">His method was to make the judicial inquiry, which this Court says that under Section 301 one is not to make, and the subsequent bargaining history had to do with changes in Article XXII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.021" offset="11490180">The company those what to put in from that bargaining history in the joint appendix, and it is wholly opaque, so the court below was right, we think, in saying that insofar as this evidence does anything, it goes to the merits of the union's Article XX complaint in a proper post-Steelworkers Trilogy situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.660" offset="11636674">So I do think that when you put aside the choice of words and get to the substance of what the District Court did and the Court of Appeals did, the company made all the arguments it had about Article IX, about the underlying New York case, put in all this material about bargaining history, and the plain fact of the matter is that after it was done, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were correct, under this Court's test, unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute, the matter should go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.043" offset="11838235">That is where this case is.</text>
