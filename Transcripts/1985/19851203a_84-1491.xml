            <label>Mr. David H. Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="60.122" offset="385369">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="396131">Good morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.456" offset="398744">Unlike the preceding case, this is a private individual's libel case, and also unlike the preceding case, there has been a full trial and a jury verdict in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="451929">When I say that this is a private individual's libel case, I hasten to add that it also involves matters of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.939" offset="488605">The jury verdict was for the defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="506159">It was reversed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because the trial judge, in attempting to apply this Court's judgment in Gertz v. Welch instructed the jury that the burden of proving falsity was on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had to prove both falsity and negligence in failing to discover the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.923" offset="600618">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed, applying instead a Pennsylvania statutory provision which the court below held codified common law, which puts on the defendant the burden to prove truth It is our position, if it please the Court, that the Pennsylvania statutory scheme constitutes a conscious determination by the state to err on the side of punishing truthful speech on public matters, or speech that may be true, rather than allowing speech that may be false but was not proven false to go unpunished.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.516" offset="762995">In other words, we have to look at what the burden of proof does in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.420" offset="786610">The burden of proof decides the close case, and most libel cases that are fully litigated, as was this one, are the close cases on issues of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.026" offset="829033">The burden of proof says if you have a case where the evidence of truth or falsity is exactly equal, or if you have a case where there is no evidence on either side on the issue of truth or falsity, if the defendant has the burden, the speech of the defendant will be punished even though it may very well have been true and has not been proven false.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.343" offset="930283">It is this rule which we contend turns First Amendment law upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.913" offset="952540">Now, why do I say it turns First Amendment law upside down?</text>
            <text syncTime="206.698" offset="971661">Simply because in Pennsylvania the rule is instead of protecting some false speech in order to be sure we are protecting true speech that counts, that matters, Pennsylvania is willing to punish some true speech that matters in order to punish some false speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.778" offset="1048043">In Garrison and Sullivan, this Court clearly held 21 years ago that truthful discussion of public affairs cannot be the subject of criminal or civil sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.769" offset="1099975">And the courts... this Court since those holdings have been wrestling with the problem that the protection of truthful speech about public affairs is so important that we must also protect some false speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.862" offset="1164340">That's why we have the rule for a public figure that even if the speech was false, we protect it unless it was knowingly false or recklessly false.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.903" offset="1208540">And Gertz says for a private figure case, even if the speech was false, we protect that speech unless it was at least negligently false.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.811" offset="1252112">Mr. Marion, here we have a private figure case, and as I understand it, the defamatory statement was couched in very broad, general terms, something to the effect that federal investigators have found connections between Thrifty and underworld figures, something about that broad.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="299.910" offset="1344481">Now, Pennsylvania has a shield law, as I understand it, so that the plaintiff, the private figure plaintiff here would be unable to in the course of deposition and discovery find out the source of those broad allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.138" offset="1417415">That makes it a pretty tough proposition in a case like this, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.094" offset="1457225">In the first place, this was not a generalized statement that was libelous.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.331" offset="1478228">The statements were very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.598" offset="1487318">The defendant said that the plaintiff companies had used organized crime influences to approach a named state senator and get him to influence the legislature and the governor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="349.590" offset="1543220">Well, what if the allegation were as broad as I read to you, and in a jurisdiction where there is a shield law?</text>
            <text syncTime="357.929" offset="1576553">Now, how is the plaintiff going to disprove?</text>

            <label>Mr. David H. Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="361.148" offset="1589509">Very simple, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.100" offset="1597242">Even assuming that the allegation was broad, let's say the allegation was so broad as simply to say the plaintiff had connections with organized crime, and we're not gong to tell you how we know, it seems to me, Your Honor, that in that case, just as in this case, in the court below, the plaintiff always knows whether or not there are connections with organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.933" offset="1708628">The plaintiff can take the stand and testify, as this plaintiff did, I had no connection with organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.523" offset="1743005">A good plaintiff's lawyer can ask him a series of questions, how did you conduct your business, did you conduct it lawfully, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.260" offset="1769963">Just by taking the stand and asserting his honest conduct of business, his lack of any connections with organized crime, as a practical matter, that plaintiff shifts the burden of production of evidence to the defendant because if the defendant sits silent after the plaintiff comes and says what the facts are, the defendant runs a very real risk if not of defaulting on the case, of losing on the case, and no defendant will do it, and this defendant didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.946" offset="1892634">This defendant came up with item after item of specific information of what the connections were.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.468" offset="1922727">If you look in the record, in the Joint Appendix at page A-59, you will see a chart which shows all of the connections to organized crime by the name of the person and what his connection was.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.728" offset="1979779">He was an employee, he was getting consulting funds and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.147" offset="2009454">It seems to me this cuts in the other direction because if the allegedly defamatory statement is that Thrifty has connections with organized crime, and the issue is whether... say there is no doubt about the persons with whom Thrifty had connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.805" offset="2064102">It had connections with Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C, and the issue is whether Mr. A, B, and C are members of organized crime or not, and you have indicated that the newspaper has all sorts of proof on that issue, but conceivably the Plaintiff might not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.231" offset="2121780">We might say yes, I know Mr. A, B, and C very well, but as far as I know they don't have anything to do with organized crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.939" offset="2476628">I know of no connections to organized crime, that shifts the burden of production to the defendant, and in this case the defendant did come forward and say precisely what the connections were; it's all in the record; and why they were said to have the connections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.724" offset="4919808">It's got to be proven false, and the final argument I would make on that issue is I'd like to discuss the relationship between falsity and fault, which is raised by the Gertz case, falsity and fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.535" offset="4991070">We recognize that it's possible to isolate falsity and speak about it separately from fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.106" offset="5021268">But the question we ask the Court, does that make sense, is it rational?</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.493" offset="5038822">And the way to decide whether it makes sense is to say what is the purpose of the fault requirement to begin with?</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.866" offset="5072363">Now, Justice Powell, concurring in Cox Broadcasting, after the Gertz opinion had been written, said that our... that the Court's opinions dealing with the First Amendment limitations on state defamation actions have undertaken to identify a standard of care with respect to the truth of the published facts that will afford the required breathing space for First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.850" offset="5188242">And let me repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.885" offset="5192422">What we are doing, what this Court has been doing is establishing a standard of care with respect to the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.206" offset="5221679">We are not interested in a standard of care and fault in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.760" offset="5239965">It's fault in failing to ascertain the truth that is the issue before the Court in every libel case, and that's why the trial judge's charge to the jury, which is in the Joint Appendix in this case, was the rational way for the jury to consider these issues, not to say that in such an intertwined issue as truth as fault, care in ascertaining truth, to say on the care part of that the plaintiff has the burden, but on the ascertaining the truth or the truth, the defendant has the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.481" offset="5366816">That makes no sense, it's irrational, it puts too great a burden on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.283" offset="5386042">First the jury should find whether the plaintiff proved falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.170" offset="5401611">If it's not false, it doesn't matter how careless or reckless the defendant was in the abstract; the fault we are interested in is fault in failing to discovery the falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.458" offset="5446750">And that is why I believe Justice White said what I think is obvious in Herbert v. Lando that the plaintiff, that he's got to establish fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.766" offset="5487919">If that's the floor, the threshold for liability to protect First Amendment rights, then he must also establish falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.022" offset="5520938">Falsity is the essential element of a libel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.808" offset="5536089">It's the dividing line between protecting speech and not protecting speech, and what this case comes down to, I respectfully suggest, is what is it more important to protect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.549" offset="5583109">If you put the burden of proof on the plaintiff, some defendants will go unpunished, even though they made false statements that the plaintiff can't prove to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.554" offset="5623129">That is unfortunate, but that is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.208" offset="5637758">If on the other hand you put the burden on the defendants will be punished for making truthful statements that they are unable to prove are true, and that is not only unfortunate but unconstitutional as a violation of both the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.337" offset="5710274">Therefore, we urge this Court to invalidate the Pennsylvania statute that puts the burden on the defendant and reinstate the jury verdict for the defendant below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.635" offset="5807449">The Philadelphia Inquirer argues that every private figure libel plaintiff in every case to which the rules of Gertz v. Robert Welch applies must have the burden of proving falsity as a matter of federal constitutional law, and that a 140 year old Pennsylvania rule codified by statute which places the burden of proving truth on the defendant is therefore unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.568" offset="5899191">Its contention is not supported by history or precedent or policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.737" offset="5923851">The issue of truth or falsity is very different from the issue of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.339" offset="5942241">The two are not intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.375" offset="5950391">The proper balance between the fundamental societal interests in free press and protection of private reputation will not be achieved if in addition to proving fault the private figure libel plaintiff is required to prove that the defamatory statements publicly made about him are untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.455" offset="6030744">Since 1790 the Pennsylvania constitution has explicitly provided that the rights of acquiring, possessing and protecting reputation are inherent and indefeasible rights, just as are those of enjoying and protecting life, liberty and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.433" offset="6106603">The constitution also provides, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.718" offset="6119769">"every man for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.760" offset="6159893">Based upon these important Pennsylvania constitutional provisions, the Pennsylvania Superior Court in 1898 in the case of Commonwealth v. Swallow, held that the rights of the publisher and of the person defamed, and again I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.270" offset="6221960">"rest on the same constitutional ground and demand an exact balance of the scales of justice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.174" offset="6249545">The balance of rights which had existed in Pennsylvania, that is, between free press and protection of private reputation which is required by the Pennsylvania constitution, was seriously upset by the ruling of the trial court in this case declaring that the Pennsylvania statute placing the burden of proving truth on the defendant was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.353" offset="6534280">The issue had never arisen since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.488" offset="6542848">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in... during the 1970s in two other cases has relied upon this Pennsylvania constitutional provision for certain explicit reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.963" offset="6596765">One is in a case called Moyer v. Phillips, a 1975 case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules that the right of defamation, to claim a cause of action of defamation, must survive the death of either the plaintiff or the defendant because the cause of action of defamation is protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution and stands on the same basis with other causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.478" offset="6690806">There was another case in 1978 where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was ruling on an issue where somebody was illegally committed to a mental institution, and when that person was found that the commitment was illegal, and then that person petitioned to have the records of his commitment destroyed, and the court held that because the right of reputation is so important, the court would order destruction of those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.478" offset="6798848">Those to my knowledge are the only times that this specific provision has been construed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.417" offset="6830509">So the question I think that we have to face here is whether the rule of Gertz, which says that the states may not impose liability without fault, also means that the private plaintiff must, in addition to proving fault, prove falsity, and I think the answer to that is an unequivocal no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.398" offset="6910443">Falsity can be proved without resort to proof of fault, and fault can be proved without resort to evidence of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.087" offset="6945238">The two are not intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.372" offset="6954329">Mr. Marion gave the example that I have in my brief of what I call the lucky reporter, and I think that's an important example to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.126" offset="6985362">It shows how the two issues are very separate from each other, and I think going beyond that point, we have a question of whether the Court wants to create rules that might encourage the reporter to act like this lucky reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.051" offset="7041056">We could very well have a situation where a reporter does what the reporter did in my case, and the reporter happens to be working for the New York Times or the Philadelphia Inquirer, the two most important newspapers in their respective cities, each of which have a substantial amount of credibility within their communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.247" offset="7113885">In Pennsylvania we have an extremely broad shield law, as has been indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.901" offset="7132484">If it turns out that the private... that that report is untrue, the private plaintiff gets on the witness stand and he says I didn't pay that bribe, or perhaps the public official gets up and he says I never accepted the bribe, that would be the only evidence that we could put forth in that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.028" offset="7208971">The reporter gets on the stand and says I have a confidential source, an extremely reliable confidential source in city government who I have relied upon dozens of times in the past, and he told me that the bribe had been paid and he saw the money change hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.138" offset="7277411">I can't tell you who it is because it's a confidential source, but I can tell you that he's extremely reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.190" offset="8849669">I think it makes a big difference in a trial, it makes a big difference in the balance of rights in the close cases, as I agree, Mr. Marion points out that it does make a difference, and that's what we are arguing about here, but it makes a difference because of the rights that we are balancing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.986" offset="8912781">That's the decision that the Court has decided to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.688" offset="8923648">What Gertz involves is an issue of balancing the rights of free speech and free press with the rights of the individual, private reputation, both of which are considered to be important, and you have to give some breathing space which you do through the fault or the negligence requirement, but at the same time, you have to give the plaintiff a fair chance to prove his case because his rights are important as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.267" offset="9013927">Now, the fact that the two... the two rules, that there's the burden of proving truth being upon the defendant and the burden of proving fault or negligence being on the plaintiff is not logically inconsistent, as evidenced by Pennsylvania law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.211" offset="9073696">We've had those rules in Pennsylvania since 1885.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.931" offset="9088638">The... in Pennsylvania, which has a libel law which has not run in the mainstream, it has been the burden of the plaintiff to prove negligence and the burden of the defendant to prove truth, if he defends on truth, and he doesn't have to, but if he does, and those two have coexisted since 1895 without conceptual difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.594" offset="9171289">I think my reading of Gertz, that Gertz, the requirement of fault does not also require falsity, is also supported by the majority opinion of this Court in Cox Broadcasting versus Cohen where the Court one year after Gertz said that the Court has nevertheless carefully left open the question whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that truth be recognized as a defense in a defamation action brought by a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.578" offset="9279227">Now, if the Court has not decided that issue as of that time, which was after Gertz, it certainly could not have decided that the Plaintiff must have the burden of proving falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.184" offset="9317575">Pennsylvania libel law, I believe, represents a textbook example of the proper balance of the fundamental rights that have to be accommodated in a private figure libel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.992" offset="9364804">It's structure fits comfortably within the substantial latitude which Gertz extended to the states in fashioning their libel laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.329" offset="9394166">It maintains a permissible balance between equally fundamental rights which are protected equally under the Pennsylvania Constitution, and it is not inconsistent with the federal constitutional requirement that the plaintiff prove fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.755" offset="9451949">Now, I've mentioned a few aspects of the matrix of Pennsylvania law, and I think it's important just to highlight them again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.027" offset="9484967">We have for a long time had the burden of proving truth on the defendant if it's raised as a defense, and it is only one of many, many defenses that a defendant has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.217" offset="9521748">We've had the burden of proving fault or negligence placed on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.854" offset="9540347">We have the shield law because the plaintiff has to sustain his burden of proving negligence without necessarily being able to require the reporter to divulge any sources that he chooses not to divulge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.511" offset="9590920">And the Inquirer in this case is asking for a rule of general application where in some future case you may be faced with the precise issue that Justice O'Connor raised, where no sources are disclosed, and it's just the bare case of we had good sources, we had reliable sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.640" offset="9667407">We're not going to tell you who they are, but we'll tell you they're reliable, and we've used them in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.215" offset="10641774">Now, we did know who some of the sources were in this case, and some of those sources came in to testify, but we didn't by any means know all of the sources, and we didn't know who we considered to be crucial sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.773" offset="10691929">The reporters invoked the shield law 20 times during the course of the trial, 20 separate occasions which the judge supported, and we don't know who that information came from, whether that information even existed, and certainly what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.199" offset="10749712">We do know in one case, one time Mr. Ecenbarger testified he wrote in his article that the particular state senator involved, a Senator Frank Mazzei, had no "visible", the word "visible" I believe was in quotes, financial links with Thrifty or financial ties with Thrifty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.328" offset="10822228">We did ask Mr. Ecenbarger what that was based on and he said, well, federal authorities, federal authorities thought he had financial ties with Thrifty but they couldn't find any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.534" offset="10859008">So he wrote they have no visible financial links with Thrifty, and that's how that came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.588" offset="10879279">But that's the extent of the information that we were able to get from the federal sources, whoever they might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.407" offset="10902476">Now, after these articles appeared, the chain stopped growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.376" offset="10922434">Some stores left the chain, other stores lost business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.745" offset="10935913">There was evidence at trial of damages exceeding $5 million from this defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.649" offset="10959527">There was a strike force grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.869" offset="10972380">The Internal Revenue Service audited ten years of Thrifty's records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.571" offset="10987217">No indictment was ever issued after the grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.123" offset="11005398">The IRS concluded its audit by determining that the government owed Thrifty $278.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.111" offset="11029327">Even though the Inquirer published the fact of the existence of these investigations, it never published how the investigations terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.699" offset="11059733">So when Hepps sued for libel, he of course tried to prove that what was written about him and his chain was untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.055" offset="11093065">But he was stymied because of the amorphous nature of the charges and because of the invocation of the shield law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.959" offset="11120755">Now, the Inquirer and its amici in this case suggest that even if the Gertz rule of fault does not include falsity, that the Court should fashion a new constitutional rule to give more protection to the press than the protection that Gertz allows, and we believe that this argument fails for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.876" offset="11224409">It fails first because it fails to give adequate or sufficient constitutional weight to reputation, which is also entitled to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.447" offset="11250636">It fails second because it lacks fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.165" offset="11265578">And it fails third because there is no compelling evidence that the press is not adequately protected under Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.053" offset="11289088">The court has repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of individual private reputations in Gertz, again in Dun &amp; Bradstreet, on numerous other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.361" offset="11330362">The Court has quoted Justice Stewart's statement in Rosenblatt v. Baer that the individual's right to protect his own good name is a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty and a basic of our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.752" offset="11383860">In Palko v. Connecticut, Justice Cardozo used substantially identical words, the words implicit in the concept of ordered liberty to describe First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.459" offset="11430672">We believe this is not a coincidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.994" offset="11440912">The Bill of Rights reflects the concept of the essential dignity and the worth of every individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.815" offset="11464109">From that concept there flows a variety of rights which this Court has deemed to be essential, and as long as a proper balance is maintained among those various rights, the underlying concept of human dignity will remain viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.242" offset="11517816">When one right is... no one of these rights should be favored without compelling reason to the virtual exclusion of any of the other rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.347" offset="11550313">With regard to the issue of fairness, there is much in the briefs on both sides on whether it is more fair to have the plaintiff prove falsity, more fair to have the defendant prove truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.803" offset="11592109">I don't want to restate those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.238" offset="11597856">What I want to do is add something else into the equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.440" offset="11610603">The Inquirer is part of a powerful, increasingly consolidated industry which has created a virtual daily newspaper monopoly in substantially every city in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.915" offset="11656579">The significance of that fact in this case is that the preferred means for any individual, especially the private person, to defend himself against a barrage of defamatory statements, that is, by responding to words with words, is essentially unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.440" offset="11722616">Philadelphia although it has two newspapers, is basically a one newspaper town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.242" offset="11741842">Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. owns both of the newspapers, and that is only one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.879" offset="11760442">The saying that the press is indeed free to everybody who owns one is not without relevance in this discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.033" offset="11788967">It will be recalled that in this case, even though Mr. Hepps called the Inquirer reporters after each of the articles appeared, the reporters refused to talk to him despite his requests, and they never published his denials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.875" offset="11844347">On the issue of self-censorship, I would submit, which is raised by the Inquirer in its brief, I would submit that that's not truly an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.731" offset="11879769">We have to keep in mind that regardless of what the Court decides in this case, on the issue before the Court, a defendant who reasonably believes that what he wrote was true will never have liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.039" offset="11925013">A defendant who has published truth is, if he has acted in a reasonable manner, will either be able to prove truth or prove that he had a reasonable basis for believing that it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.196" offset="11977676">If he can't prove either of those, he is probably in the situation of the reporter who is publishing based on no substantial facts at all, and I don't believe the Court should fashion a rule that would encourage that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.706" offset="12035668">Those statistics that are available would indicate that the press has fared reasonably well under Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.879" offset="12068373">In the summer-fall 1984 issue of the Libel Defense Resource Center Bulletin, it was found that of the few cases that went to trial, 56 percent of private figures were successful versus 55 percent of public figures, and 50 percent of public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.156" offset="12129500">The consistency of those statistics would indicate that a negligence standard has not created an open season on the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.875" offset="12156354">Also, at least as of mid-1974, the last time that I have seen statistics available, there has not been one million dollar judgment yet affirmed in a liable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.600" offset="12195328">The case before this Court involves a newspaper which defamed a private citizen through guilt by association of connections to the amorphous entity called organized crime, and of illegal and immoral business conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.508" offset="12250917">It did so without getting his side of the story in advance, and it refused to print or even to listen to his side afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.264" offset="12277980">Although it was the accuser, its lawyer told the jury, and I quote from Mr. Marion's closing argument to the jury,</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.750" offset="12303893">"We do not have to put on any evidence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.469" offset="12314760">"We have no burden on us. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.988" offset="12324791">Now it comes to this Court and it says ignore the history of libel law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.606" offset="12343286">Ignore the Pennsylvania constitution which in Article 1, Section 1 explicitly protects reputation as an inherent and indefeasible right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.979" offset="12380798">Ignore the rights of the states under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to fashion appropriate remedies for libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.900" offset="12404517">Ignore all these things and require the private plaintiff to prove that he is not guilty of the charges we have leveled against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.389" offset="12434401">Ever since Gertz, this Court has consistently resisted efforts to further constitutionalize the law of private figure libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.642" offset="12463449">It has done so in proper deference to the fundamental value of a private individual's reputation and the freedom which the Constitution grants to the states in our federal system to protect private reputation through the experimental laboratory of its courts and its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.337" offset="12526247">Explicit in these rulings is the understanding that the need to protect private reputation and the right to freedom of speech are themselves inextricably intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.777" offset="12563968">They both support and they both give meaning to the concept of individual dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.062" offset="12581105">Accordingly, absent a truly compelling showing of necessity for the sweeping new rule which the Inquirer is seeking here, which simply has not been made in this case, the factors of policy, history, basic fairness and interests of federalism all point to the conclusion that the Court should continue to allow Pennsylvania the latitude to allocate the burden of proving truth or falsity in a private figure libel case as it sees fit, keeping in mind that whatever it decides on that issue, it will not be imposing liability without fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.840" offset="12756229">Number one, in this case and in most cases it is a completely phony issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.142" offset="12773470">This is proved if you look in the joint appendix at page A-91.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.713" offset="12795727">The plaintiff had a point for charge to the jury in which the plaintiff set forth the four assertions it claimed were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.218" offset="12829790">None of these assertions is amorphous, as Mr. Surkin says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.039" offset="12849016">Each claimed false statement is detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.324" offset="12862182">Secondly, none of those four statements has anything to do with confidential sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.078" offset="12885170">There was no obstacle in proving the falsity of them by the fact that the shield law was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.649" offset="12915472">For example, the first one is the Thrifty chain had been banished by order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.440" offset="12962597">The jury could decide whether it was fair or not fair to say that the Thrifty chain had been banished.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.911" offset="13084536">But I say to this court, how can we fashion a rule of federal constitutional law based on Pennsylvania shield law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.017" offset="13121003">I don't think we can.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.944" offset="13288709">No defendant wants to try his case and rely on the shield law if he doesn't have to because it invites the argument which Mr. Rome made vigorously in the trial court.</text>
