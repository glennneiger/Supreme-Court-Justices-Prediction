            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="202563">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Bowsher v. Synar and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="239970">Mr. Cutler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="13.491" stopTime="210.318">
            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="13.491" offset="256480">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.311" offset="287722">This case involves the constitutional interplay between two statutes, one passed in 1921 and the other in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.119" offset="330981">In a larger sense, it involves the validity of the concept of the independent officer of the United States first approved by this Court in Humphrey's Executor, and Congress before and since that time has enacted many laws creating officers of the United States duly appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate who serve for a fixed term, independent of presidential direction, and are not removable by the President at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.376" offset="476013">The 1921 Budget and Accounting Act created the Office of the Comptroller General and assigned to him the same functions previously performed by the Comptroller of the Treasury, an officer of the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.187" offset="547275">He was to serve for a fixed term, and he was to be removable only for cause after hearing by the passage of a law to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.395" offset="592101">The 1985 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act assigned an additional reporting function to the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.453" offset="644346">The Comptroller General's report, under the '85 act, determines whether Congress has met the specified deficit reduction targets, and if not, what reductions under a statutory formula are required in order to meet that target.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.799" offset="725743">The report then triggers a presidential order which commands those reductions unless Congress responds by enacting some different law that meets the target by a different mix of tax increases or deficit reductions, or modifies or suspends the law in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="816127">The District Court held that this '85 act function assigned to the Comptroller General was incompatible with the removal power granted to Congress under the 1921 act by the enactment of a removal law because, said the District Court, that removal power, even though never exercised, created a here and now subservience of the Comptroller General to Congress that made it impermissible for him to perform this reporting function under the 1985 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.309" offset="983729">If the Court permits, since we have three counsel arguing for the appellants, we have tried to organize our argument so that I will deal with the status of the Comptroller General under the 1921 act and the removal clause--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="210.318" stopTime="227.446">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="210.318" offset="1043810">Mr. Cutler, if the Comptroller General were removed for any one of the four reasons... I think there are four reasons specified in the statute... is there any review by anyone of that action?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="227.446" stopTime="241.122">
            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="227.446" offset="1112251">--Oh, it is a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.998" offset="1122491">I suppose its constitutionality would be reviewable by the removed person or perhaps on challenge by the President if he had been excluded from his constitutional removal power.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="241.122" stopTime="245.574">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="241.122" offset="1167004">Would it be any different from a removal by way of an impeachment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="245.574" stopTime="433.478">
            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="245.574" offset="1184767">I would suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, that a removal by way of impeachment would... I don't know whether it would be judicially reviewable by this Court, for example, as to whether it complied with the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.286" offset="1251641">It would be a difficult point, particularly of the President, since the Chief Justice would have presided in the impeachment, but I believe certainly a removal pursuant to this statute by the passage of a law would be subject to a constitutional due process or other challenge by the removed person or by the President on the ground that he has been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.866" offset="1342024">In any event, the power, as you know, has never been exercised in the 65 years since the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.138" offset="1371072">Mr. Ross is going to deal with the additional function assigned to the Comptroller General under the '85 act, and Mr. Davidson is going to deal with the additional argument rejected below that the delegation of this '85 act function to any officer of the United States, even in the executive branch, would be void for overbreadth under the delegation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.889" offset="1478070">In reaching its decision, the District Court did not consider the legislative history of the 1921 act or the validity of this 1921 removal provision within the context of the '21 act, and we submit that that was a fundamental error.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.821" offset="1569812">The District Court declined to do that because, it said, courts never choose which of two allegedly incompatible statutes to strike down, that they always act to strike down the statute under which the plaintiff claims that his injury occurred, and in that case, of course, this would be the 1985 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.536" offset="1672630">But as we have cited in our briefs, in Glidden v. Zdanok, this Court did precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.456" offset="1704290">The Court there was dealing with an assignment statute authorizing the assignment of the Court of Claims and Customs and Patent Appeals judges to regular, other regular Article 3 courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.282" offset="1755595">That was the statute that allegedly injured the plaintiffs in those cases, and the Court, instead of striking down that statute, which was arguably incompatible with earlier statutes giving advisory jurisdiction, advisory opinion jurisdiction to those two courts which would interfere with their Article 3 status, decided that Congress had intended to make them Article 3 courts from the beginning, and that if necessary, the objectionable jurisdiction provisions in the earlier statutes would have to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.289" offset="1899686">And when the District Court thought it was confronted with a similar problem here, we submit it should have adopted the same reasoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.478" offset="1936467">You feel that the Glidden case is primary authority for your position here.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.565" offset="1964783">Well, Mr. Cutler, aren't we guided in determining severability if some portion of the statute is found to be unconstitutional by the expressed intent of Congress, which in this case would indicate that Congress had some fallback position which it articulated should be followed?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="467.532" offset="2072617">There is no question that in the 1985 statute Congress had a fallback provision if any part of the so-called reporting function, using the Comptroller General and acting on the reports of OMB and CBO, were found unconstitutional, but one would never reach that issue if, by examining the 1921 act, one had concluded that the removal provision in the 1921 act was itself unconstitutional and a nullity, particularly since the time of Myers v. the United States--</text>

            <text syncTime="526.238" offset="2307510">If that presumptively constitutional provision which has been used as a sword to strike down the 1985 act is found to be unconstitutional on its face, or found on the other hand not to create a here and now subservience to Congress with respect to the many administrative or executive functions being performed by the Comptroller General under the 1921 act, then you would have to conclude that the '21 provision is a nullity and that it should not interfere in any way with the validity of the delegation functions under the '85 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.219" offset="2803419">I would submit not, Justice Rehnquist because Congress clearly intended in the 1985... the 1921 act to establish the Comptroller General as an independent officer of the United States because he was to receive these administrative functions, like settling the government's account, bringing suits to collect the government's claims, and setting the accounting standards for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.786" offset="2909685">The whole argument about the 1921 act, President Wilson's veto, the arguments that were made to the Court in Myers about the '21 act were all premised on the assumption that the Comptroller was an independent officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.681" offset="2985231">During the debate on an attempt to override President Wilson's veto, which asserted the ground, among others, that he had the sole power to remove an officer of the United States when he was given the power to appoint, and that Congress could not take part in the process, the whole argument which was adopted by the Court in Myers is based on the premise that he is an independent officer of the United States and not an officer of Congress as the Solicitor General is urging before you today, in contrast to what the Solicitor General in the Myers case urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.623" offset="3132979">He said the Comptroller General was an executive officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.825" offset="3145832">But when the veto provision was up to be overridden, the question... and the override failed... the question was asked on the floor of the House, what if we override, and then President Wilson's veto, or his position is upheld by the courts, would the entire act fall, and the answer was that that was a remote possibility and that if any part of the act fell, to that extent, the act would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.164" offset="3283131">So we would read that as indicating that Congress would have preferred to have an independent Comptroller General serving for 15 years even if the President had a right of removal, and as we know later from Wiener, his right of removal in those circumstances would be limited to removal only for cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.483" offset="4440460">If that happened, I would say, as I did in response to the other question, that removal provision is a nullity and has been since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.755" offset="4481525">It is perhaps an open question for this Court whether Humphrey's limitation of Myers to independent officers reaches the portion of Myers that relates to participation of the Congress in the removal process, but should you conclude Congress cannot participate in the removal process, that provision is a nullity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.904" offset="4574103">And as to severance, Justice O'Connor, if I may return to that for just a moment, in the Myers case itself, the Court was considering a statute that authorized the President to appoint and remove postmasters of various classes by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.368" offset="4651947">It also provided for the salaries of postmasters and assigned them various functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.884" offset="5162067">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.984" offset="5170426">I appear here this morning on behalf of the Speaker and Bipartisan Leadership Group of the United States House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.823" offset="5197802">My argument will proceed in the following fashion: First I will try to describe the functions given to the Comptroller General under the 1985 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.346" offset="5235941">Secondly, I will describe the history and the necessity for his choice to perform those functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.499" offset="5256525">And then finally, I will turn to the question of the constitutional appropriateness of that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.367" offset="5275961">The 1985 act, Emergency Deficit Control Act, proceeds from a simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.240" offset="5307516">That proposition is to set statutory targets which in a declining basis... which, when met will result in a balanced budget by 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.781" offset="5353596">To meet these deficit target figures a simple process is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.352" offset="5375957">That process calls for certain calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.554" offset="5392676">Those calculations start with economic projections and then, using those economic projections, a forecast of the projected deficit, and then using that projected deficit, comparing it to the statutory target figure, a determination of the shortfall, and then applying the statutory formula, arriving at how to meet that shortfall from taking money from each account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.871" offset="5494031">In making these calculations, the Comptroller General is performing functions similar to the functions that he has always performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.644" offset="5529139">He makes accounting determinations with respect to the federal budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.262" offset="5543559">It is, in essence, a pre-audit, telling federal paymasters and disbursing officers how much money they will have to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.000" offset="5574488">The District Court accurately described these calculations as the application of law to present and future facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.521" offset="5604581">Equally accurate, but more colorful, was Judge Scalia's description in oral argument that what this job was was something for a man with a green eyeshade, that it was an accountant's job, not power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.429" offset="5656199">The District Court correctly concluded that the Comptroller General is not responsible for a single policy judgment under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.269" offset="5687546">Next let me turn to the necessity for having the Comptroller as the impartial budget scorekeeper, and why he was chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.041" offset="5718684">When the proposal first originated in the Senate, these calculations which were always part of the proposal were to be performed jointly by the President's office, OMB, and by the Congressional Budget Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.615" offset="5773019">When that proposal reached the House, it was not surprising that the House chose not to entrust these functions to OMB whose director, of course, shares office space with the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.740" offset="5817427">Instead, the House chose to give these functions to the nonpartisan CBO, or Congressional Budget Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.327" offset="5847833">Since the director of the Congressional Budget Office is appointed not by the President but by the Congress, there were those who raised problems with this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.785" offset="5889629">The proposal was then made on the floor of the House by leaders of both parties, Representative Gephardt, a member of the Democratic leadership, and Representative Cheney, a member of the Republican leadership, that in order to ensure that these calculations are walled off from any possible manipulation, that they be given to the independent, long-tenured Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.631" offset="5977087">As the proposal bounced back and forth between the Senate and the eventual conference, this proposal was eventually enacted, and these functions were given to the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.637" offset="6017107">Although the bill had many detractors and many concerns were raised about it, at no time did these detractors raise any concerns over the role of the Comptroller General, nor did the President raise any constitutional concerns over the role of the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.698" offset="6085339">The choice of the Comptroller was consistent with two recent judicial decisions in which district courts had determined in the face of the challenge by the executive that the Comptroller could be given important administrative tasks because he was an independent officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.394" offset="6148137">The selection was also a recognition of the historic role of the Comptroller, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.381" offset="6172065">Mr. Ross, wouldn't you concede that the historic role of the Comptroller General is really that of an employee of the legislative branch, in effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.837" offset="6217832">Hasn't he been considered an arm of the legislative Branch rather than the executive branch, historically?</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.996" offset="6270494">He was... and it is not the nature... it's the nature of the function rather than the label that is given to him that should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.702" offset="6309365">His function was historically first performed in the United States by a Comptroller within the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.708" offset="6337368">When James Madison urged the first Congress to create such an office, he specifically alluded to the importance that such an office had a unique, independent status, and in fact, urged that the tenure be given would be one which would make him accountable to the public generally, and so that while over the years the Comptroller has, for example, been funded in certain years out of the legislative branch appropriations and in other years out of executive branch appropriations, I don't believe that is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.560" offset="6460770">The function of the Comptroller, which is checking the expenditures from the public purse, has always been considered one that is necessary to be performed by an independent officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.565" offset="9272800">And so I think that because the Constitution does not require that the... that there be an officer labeled as either executive, judicial or legislative, that as long as those requirements which are contained within the Constitution are met, that separation of powers is properly protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.737" offset="10033485">Before turning to the delegation argument, if I may pick up on several points which have been discussed, in further response to Justice Powell's question whether there is any other agency of the United States for which there is a provision for congressional removal, there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.317" offset="10115823">There has been since 1933 in the Tennessee Valley Authority Act a provision that the Congress could, by concurrent resolution, not even involving the President of the United States, remove members of the TVA board, and yet no one has thought because of that vestigial provisions, as dormant as the provision in the 1921 Budget and Accounting Act, that the Tennessee Valley Authority is a committee of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.337" offset="10227836">It has functioned in a clearly executive capacity, redeveloped an entire region of the United States, notwithstanding a provision which purports to give to the Congress the power to remove even without the participation of the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.416" offset="10312160">And in response to the question what does the Comptroller General do for the executive branch, I would add that in each of our libraries there are 60 or more volumes of Comptroller General decisions, decisions which are rendered principally, overwhelmingly at the request of the executive branch, Disbursing and other fiscal offices, asking for the Comptroller General's ruling on proposed expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.269" offset="10431592">The Comptroller General is able to undertake that function because in the 1981 Act the Congress made the critical decision that he must be an officer of the United States, appointed by the President under the appointments clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2572.529" offset="10492614">That isn't entirely a courtesy, though, on the part of the Comptroller General, because the reason the executive branch authorities seek the Comptroller General's ruling is that they run the risk of being surcharged, don't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.753" offset="10537544">And the reason that they run the risk of being surcharged is that the Comptroller General inherited under the statute the power of the control of the Treasury, to issue rulings which are binding on the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.560" offset="10588744">When the Congress considered in 1921 how he should be appointed, it was deemed to be indispensable that he be appointed by the President because of that very kind of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.868" offset="10633988">In 1980 when the Congress provided for the recommendation of names to the President on the appointment of the Comptroller General, the statute was deliberated over several Congresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.628" offset="10696996">The point made by the Department of Justice that, in order for the Comptroller General to continue to exercise his executive functions, the President must still retain the power, and complete power, to choose any Comptroller General for nomination to the Congress at his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.589" offset="10768885">The statute provides the word "recommend" several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.124" offset="10786961">The legislative history is absolutely explicit that the President may ask either for names... that's in the statute... or to nominate anyone not on the list whom the President deems should be the recipient of his nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.884" offset="10842027">The power of the President to nominate the Comptroller General, to appoint the person who he deems to be the best suited for that position, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, has not been infringed upon by the 1980 enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.810" offset="10901796">If I could turn to the delegation issue, the plaintiffs, Representative Synar and the Treasury Employees Union, ask this Court to affirm the judgment below on the alternative ground that the administrative powers under this Act may not be delegated to any officer, no matter what his or her constitutional qualifications may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.926" offset="10998240">The district court rejected that contention, holding that the Congress has made the policy judgments which constitute the essence of the legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.483" offset="11040454">Because the Act's administrative mechanism is a standby procedure which may never be utilized after the present fiscal year, in large part plaintiffs' contention is a theoretical argument against the possible implementation of a statute relating to future facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.313" offset="11123732">But as anticipated, the procedure is being utilized this year to effect a small reduction in this year's estimated $220 billion deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.086" offset="11162811">Yet plaintiffs point to no determination of the Comptroller for this fiscal year which is even colorably questionable under the delegation argument, but look ahead, as I will now with my argument, to the fiscal years which will follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.923" offset="11494253">Congress would be told that it cannot provide for an administrative mechanism, even on a standby basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.143" offset="11515046">Looking ahead, then, with the plaintiffs to future fiscal years, it is important to note both what the Comptroller General does and when he does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.749" offset="11553499">The annual budget process begins in January or February, when the President submits his message to the Congress, and continues until October 1st, when it is hoped that the Congress has completed action on the budget for the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.676" offset="11613267">The Comptroller General's formal administrative responsibilities under the Act occur in the latter part of this process, on the eve of its home stretch in September, when the Comptroller reports to the President on August 25th about the extent to which the budget which has been enacted to date or, utilizing various assumptions in the statute which would then apply if it has not been enacted, calculates the amount by which the deficit would exceed the amount prescribed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.413" offset="11748163">The terms of the Act establish that the Congress has fulfilled the essence of the legislative function by establishing policy and prescribing the means of attaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.205" offset="11791317">First the law, and not the Comptroller General, determines what the maximum permissible deficit is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.394" offset="11820052">The Comptroller General is simply given no authority to make economic judgments or his own behalf as to what the desirable level of deficit financing should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.416" offset="11860176">And the law, not the Comptroller General, established the legal rules for the assumptions about what should go into or be excluded from the base of revenues and expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.157" offset="11911167">The law, not the Comptroller General, establishes that any required reductions should be spread across the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.080" offset="11938857">It mandates equal sacrifices on the defense and non-defense sides of the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.198" offset="11959337">It mandates designated exceptions and limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.686" offset="11973234">And then it mandates uniform reduction of all other accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.470" offset="11992356">After examining the Act in great detail, the district court concluded that it was not true, as the plaintiffs allege, that the Congress has declined to make the hard political judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.647" offset="12049094">It is true that the Act delegates to the Comptroller an important fact finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.217" offset="12075425">But those facts, the district court correctly concluded, are no more difficult to ascertain than the facts which are calculated in determining the discount rate, functions which other agencies wielding far more economic power have undertaken without question for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.113" offset="12142925">In this Court, in addition to renewing their specific arguments which the district court had rejected, the plaintiffs make the further argument that the Act should fail because it was motivated in their view by the desire of Congress to avoid political responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.907" offset="12218158">This new contention founders on the principle that the Court will not inquire into the praiseworthiness of the motives of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.663" offset="12249192">But moreover, objectively, as the Act is structured and as it in intended, it is designed to promote, and not to avoid, political responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.869" offset="12289943">If in any of the next five years the Comptroller reports to the President and the Congress, on the basis of the law and facts in August of that year, that there will be an excess deficit, then the President is to issue a deficit reduction order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.628" offset="12348979">But the effectiveness of that order is delayed from September 1st to October 1st, for perhaps the 30 most critical days of the entire budget calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.586" offset="12392865">What that report does is it informs the Congress of the degree to which expenditures must be reduced or revenues increased to provide for deficit reduction in another manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.929" offset="12446259">And literally every appropriation, every revenue decision of the Congress in that month, is done with the full knowledge of the legal consequences of not producing deficit reduction in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.920" offset="12502161">And then the Act provides that the President shall issue a further order in the month of October, following a subsequent report of the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.442" offset="12536330">That report of the Comptroller will identify for the President, for the Congress, and for the public the degree to which the Congress has either attained the objectives of the Act in another way or has not attained those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.102" offset="12590873">Furthermore, political accountability is ensured by the very nature of the spreading of the deficit reduction across the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.125" offset="12630997">This is not an Act that singles out individual groups for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.795" offset="12657642">It's an Act that requires that reduction be across the budget and affecting a wide variety of groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.634" offset="12685019">The parties to this lawsuit, whether they be members of Congress, the executive branch, the amici representing very articulate and powerful interests, are all participants in that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.442" offset="12732248">So what we have here is an opportunity through the political process to decide whether the Congress should in some other way achieve objectives which the Congress and the President have legislated into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.250" offset="12783552">If I could pick up a theme on the fallback, this administrative mechanism is a standby mechanism and, as I indicated, it may never be utilized again after this first year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.759" offset="12845515">But it is a fundamental part of the statute, because it was perceived by the sponsors of the Act and endorsed by the Congress that a mechanism, reliable and predictable in nature, was necessary to discipline the budget process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.471" offset="12912388">If this Court is to strike the administrative mechanism, then it removes from the statute what was perceived to be the statute's unique contribution to deficit reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.080" offset="12974873">Now, there may be some circumstances in which the fallback is the perfectly appropriate alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.317" offset="13003817">If, for example, as I indicated, this Court would decide that this power may not be delegated to an administrative officer, then annual deficit reductions through legislation is the only alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.642" offset="13057107">And if this Court were to conclude, agreeing with the Solicitor General, that this function could only be performed by an officer who serves at the President's pleasure, then it is difficult to say that the Congress would have passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.836" offset="13117815">And the reason why it is difficult to say that is that it is indispensable to the statute that there be a neutral mechanism, not committed to the policy objectives of the Congress or the President, to play the role of scorekeeper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.051" offset="13414671">The reason for that is that in enacting this statute the Congress was only searching for an officer who would be neutral and impartial in those judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.329" offset="13599827">The reasons for removal do not include disagreement with his policies, but only malfeasance in office or gross inefficiency in office, the failure of the office to operate, but not the determinations of the office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.612" offset="13697002">We agree with the Comptroller General that under this Court's decision in Weiner the Court would look to the functions of the Comptroller General in determining whether it is the kind of function which requires presidential removal at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.454" offset="13760323">And we think that it would find in those circumstances, starting from the 1921 Act, that it was the intention of the Congress that the Comptroller General not be subject to the policy pleasure of any official of the United States, whether it be the Congress or the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.099" offset="13830958">The Congress thought in 1921 that, looking at the cases that it then knew, prior to Myers, that it could be the agent to determine whether the Comptroller General had reached such a degree of inefficiency or malfeasance that removal was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.692" offset="13889263">But it specifically eschewed the power to remove for no cause at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.227" offset="13911415">If the Court retains that basic idea, which we think is required by the legislative history of that office, the Comptroller General would remain under the '85 Act an independent officer performing exactly the function which the Congress has asked him to perform under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.355" offset="13975885">In those circumstances, it would be unnecessary to radically change the statute from one which contains an administrative mechanism to one which requires an annual deficit reduction legislation, because the objectives of the Congress would still be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.548" offset="14036699">Let me add one further thought on the question of the 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.685" offset="14057283">We have made the further argument, as the Third Circuit decided only last month, that the removal issue is not ripe for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.308" offset="14095735">The Third Circuit emphasized the fact that it had never been used, and I would like to add just one further point to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.712" offset="14125410">The 1921 Act provides for a future enactment of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.532" offset="14148607">That's an enactment which would have to be approved bicamerally and presented to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.353" offset="14171908">This Court has never anticipated a future enactment of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.839" offset="14193851">And prior to the Congress ever adopting a joint resolution of removal, it would be faced with the serious constitutional questions that this Court's decisions from Myers on have presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.497" offset="14244529">We think that the level of respect from one coordinate branch to another... that the Congress be given that first opportunity, if ever the removal issue were presented to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.263" offset="14643575">Section 251 of the 1985 Act gives the Comptroller General critical responsibility for the execution of the Act by assigning to him the determination of reductions in outlays throughout the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.058" offset="14710762">This grant of authority violates the Constitution, first and principally because the grant is to an official removable only on the initiative of the Congress, an official who is for this and because of Congress' intent expressed in many other ways an agent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.055" offset="14798743">And second, because executive functions importantly affecting the whole of the executive branch and directing the President himself may only be performed by an officer who serves at the pleasure of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.099" offset="14870945">I would like to say at the outset that this second argument does not in our view in any way cast any doubt on the validity of agencies such as the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission, or any such agencies, and that the notion that the second argument in some sense endangers those agencies or would embark this Court on some constitutional adventure is simply a scare which we don't intend to throw into the Court and I don't think need be thrown there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3726.738" offset="15109495">They give orders to the President himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3766.130" offset="15267066">And I mean, can't it be said that the Federal Reserve Board, for example, through its powers basically affects the financial structure of every agency of the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="3779.622" offset="15320983">The Federal Reserve Board is a good example, because in fact what the Federal Reserve Board does is to determine, as the bank which it is established to be, the interest rate it will charge to its clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.299" offset="15383676">Now, that determination has implications.</text>

            <text syncTime="3803.552" offset="15416695">It's quite interesting that the statute setting up the Federal Reserve Board specifically said that nothing in it shall in any sense impinge on the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.045" offset="15466641">Here we have an official who gives orders to the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="4202.519" offset="17012568">Yet here it has been unwilling to let go of the actual administration of its general will, and so it has cast about for an agent who is at once respected for its competence and integrity, but nonetheless has a close and special relationship to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.250" offset="17087487">And that is, and from the outset has been, the conception of the Comptroller General.</text>

            <text syncTime="4636.250" offset="18747516">And for that reason, it is a dangerous confusion to start giving executive powers to Congress or, I suppose, legislative powers to the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="4646.956" offset="18790357">Mr. Fried, do you say that none of the other powers of the Comptroller General prior to this particular Act were executive powers in essence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="4658.164" offset="18835183">Justice O'Connor, it was the position of the executive in Stotz v. Lynn that the power under the Impoundment Act to bring suit was not valid, and for very similar reasons to those that I'm making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.041" offset="18898713">It was our position in 1969, when the Comptroller General purported to make a definitive, binding ruling that the Philadelphia Plan was unauthorized, that the executive department must look to the Attorney General for binding opinions as to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.520" offset="18976558">And indeed, that was the issue in 1933 in Miguel v. McCall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.491" offset="18992441">So there are these expressions on the central role of the Comptroller General, and wherever they have appeared the executive department has been vigilant to make an issue of them, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.100" offset="19054925">But that is an issue, that is a vigilance, we have exercised for over half a century, and in precisely the terms we urge on you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.872" offset="19094005">That the Comptroller General is an agent of Congress is we think shown most dramatically by the mode of his removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.532" offset="19152623">The Congress was very aware of what it was doing when in created this mode of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.238" offset="19187419">It chose to do that knowing how to make an agent removable for cause by the President, and yet did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.760" offset="19229528">Subsequently to that legislation, the Congress on a number of occasions has described the Comptroller General as being within the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.401" offset="19280101">And indeed, the Comptroller General by his own profession is a member of the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.988" offset="19302462">At the beginning of the red book, the Comptroller General's bible, the principles of federal appropriations law, he states that the GAO is a nonpartisan, independent agency in the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.565" offset="19356796">And this Court itself has adopted that designation in the very recent case of Bossier and Marc, adding the phrase that</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.504" offset="19388561">"The Comptroller General exists in large part to serve the needs of Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.175" offset="19419177">Now, this seems to us to indicate the kind of subservience which is inappropriate in one executing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.215" offset="19459405">This subservience, of which the district court spoke, is of course not a personal reflection on the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.452" offset="19492320">His office has been characterized by integrity and competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.320" offset="19507784">I hope the same thing would be said of the Office of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.789" offset="19525652">Yet there is no question but that that officer is subservient in the constitutional sense to the President, as the provisions for his removal in the statutes clearly show.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.798" offset="19577688">The point we make about subservience is a structural, not a personal, point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.435" offset="19600258">Now, I'd like to return for a moment to our second argument, which is that these powers, whatever other powers may be given to an officer who is not removable at will by the President, these powers are so far-reaching that they constitute indeed a constitutional novelty, and a novelty of quite remarkable proportions, and that the holding in Humphrey's Executor, the practice of the legislature, the whole existence of administrative agencies, in no way provides a precedence for this kind of sweeping power, a power which extends to giving orders to the President himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.500" offset="19788548">Now, as to the severability, I think that a number of the questions--</text>

            <text syncTime="4925.750" offset="19905472">If one turns to that removal, the severability problem, it is a question, what exactly is this Court to do if they agree with Mr. Cutler's suggestion?</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.243" offset="19959494">Is it to be a simple excision of the offending removal provision, leaving the Comptroller General irremovable?</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.365" offset="19999931">Or does Mr. Cutler propose reconstructive surgery, with some new removal, some new and apt removal provision being substituted?</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.923" offset="20046220">The very question indicates how inappropriate it would be to reach back and refashion an office carefully fashioned in 1921 in order to solve a problem created in 1985, particularly when in 1985 the Congress quite explicitly stated what it wanted done in the event there was a problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="5001.916" offset="20210165">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.268" offset="20223539">As I was listening to the argument this morning, I tried to put myself in the place of someone in the audience who had not read all the briefs and been through the statutes, and to ask myself, why did Congress create this Gramm-Rudman mechanism?</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.195" offset="20283307">What were they trying to do by putting a new form of governance into place in which we had one part Office of Management and Budget, one part Congressional Budget Office, and added the Comptroller General on top of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.054" offset="20338687">This surely was not, as Mr. Davidson suggested, a standby mechanism, because we have all the standby mechanisms we need.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.310" offset="20371706">This is operative unless Congress passes a new law to change it or unless Congress meets the budget targets of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.249" offset="20407546">No, what Congress was trying to do here... and this is wholly undisputed... was trying to create an elaborate mechanism under which it could obtain a reduction in the budget deficit without having either to increase taxes or to cut any of the spending programs, because it was unable to muster the votes needed to do that under our law-making provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.000" offset="20518514">And so it set up a new mechanism to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.702" offset="20529276">It didn't do it, as it has so often done it in delegating authority to administrative agencies, because it had too many decisions to make, because the questions were too technical, because we needed fairness and adjudicative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.795" offset="20589672">It didn't do that for any of these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.478" offset="20600434">It did it so it could accomplish through the backdoor that which it could not accomplish through the front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.984" offset="20626452">And indeed, it is not even going to relieve itself of any responsibilities, for under this statute, each year, as it did each year beginning in 1789, including 1985 and already in 1986, it is now passing on the very same appropriations laws that it has always passed on, and it will have to pass on through 1991 but with only one difference, and that is that those laws really won't count because if these three unelected officials under the statute determine that Congress hasn't done its job properly, or they and the President have not been able to reach agreement on a proper target deficit, then the Gramm-Rudman override comes in as a permanent rider affecting future laws by changing what is actually going to be appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.737" offset="20849433">That, I suggest to you, is a kind of function never before found in the history of our Republic, where administrative officials are overriding whatever Congress may do in the future insofar as this particular area of the law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.347" offset="20911918">And it is not a minor matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.882" offset="20926024">It is quite properly, as the Solicitor General observed, a sweeping power extending the entire breadth of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.721" offset="20957371">In this year alone, the budget reduction was $11.7 billion, and it would have been far higher but for the cap put on it in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.993" offset="20998436">We simply don't know how much the budget, the deficit reductions are going to be in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.164" offset="21019125">And all of this is not based on what you would hear today as some kind of a precise formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.568" offset="21048800">The key ingredients in this deficit reduction program are estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.388" offset="21072101">They are estimates made as to inflation rate, unemployment, the gross national product.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.526" offset="21096656">They are estimates made on the basis of what someone thinks is going to happen to the economy.</text>

            <text syncTime="5242.670" offset="21173143">I think the best evidence that these judgments being made are political is what happened when Congress reviewed the possibility that these determinations would be made by OMB.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.430" offset="21232179">The House said we simply cannot accept that because OMB is political, as Justice Stevens remarked earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.035" offset="21262690">These standards are subject to such manipulation, they could come out with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.689" offset="21285260">Indeed, Senator Gramm was asked on the floor of the House... on the floor of the Senate, what is the range of budget deficit cuts we are talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.443" offset="21320264">He said I couldn't give a worst case scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.178" offset="21331236">In 1985 alone, from August when Congress reached its predictions as to what the budget deficit was going to be, until October when Gramm-Rudman reached the floor of the Senate, the prediction in that narrow timeframe changed $30 billion, and in 1981 there was a swing of $60 billion in predicted deficits in a matter of 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.362" offset="21427993">And it seems to me that the key ingredient in taking this away from--</text>

            <text syncTime="5330.727" offset="21525378">The cuts this year were 4.3 percent and 4.9 percent for non-defense and defense, but this is only on a prorated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.547" offset="21552650">And that was... those cuts were that small because we had a cap built into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.968" offset="21574383">Next year there is no cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.651" offset="21581071">If the revenue projections in the statute, in the... that were used to form these deficit reduction targets, turn out to be wrong because we have much less income, then we have no limit at all on how much the deficit reductions are going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.663" offset="21645123">And what happened here in this statute was that the House of Representatives and the Senate said we cannot give these judgments to the Office of Management and Budget because these are subject to such political manipulation, and if you look at the statute, you will understand why.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.874" offset="21713982">There are lots of provisions in the act dealing with how to allocate the cuts between one branch and... between one part of the government and another, what to do if Congress doesn't pass appropriation laws, what to do about cost of living increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.551" offset="21772705">But there is not a word in the statute or the legislative history about how one is to go about predicting what the interest rate is going to be, what the gross national product is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.490" offset="21812516">No one knows what these figures are going to be because they are raw, discretionary determinations, entirely proper to be made provided that they are made by the lawmakers in this country, that is, the President in conjunction with the Senate and the House of Representatives as envisioned by Article 1 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.486" offset="21900496">That is how the laws are being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.736" offset="21909482">We have here a situation in which the hard policy choices have not been made, and I suggest to you that the very reason that Gramm-Rudman was enacted was because the Congress found that it was not making the hard choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.846" offset="21969877">It wanted to have defense, it wanted to have social programs, it wanted to have clean air, it wanted to have transportation, and it couldn't pick and choose among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.684" offset="22005299">So it hoped that by creating this mechanism you would have three unelected officials do the job that Congress was supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.707" offset="22041348">And I suggest to you that that kind of abdication goes to the very heart of our system of government, and it changes all of the dynamics around in our legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.217" offset="22091399">These are not the kind of facts that administrators normally find.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.519" offset="22108535">These are sweeping predictions as to the future, trying to say what is going to happen to the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.156" offset="22135180">They are the kinds of determinations which need to be made and which Congress will continue to make every year.</text>

            <text syncTime="5574.164" offset="22499118">If you look in the statute, there's not a word about how anybody is to figure out any of these very amorphous figures.</text>

            <text syncTime="5841.215" offset="23567422">Let me turn to the second argument I made, which is made only in our brief, and that is that... and this involves the aspect of the statute under which the Office of Congressional Budget is an intimate part of the decisionmaking process here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.975" offset="23634400">That is, when the House... when the Senate passed this bill, there was a joint determination to be made by OMB and CBO that would have become the operative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.532" offset="23672643">Everybody recognized that that would be plainly unconstitutional under Chadha and other, and Buckley because the control... the Congressional Budget Office is a pure arm of Congress, no pretense of being appointed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.590" offset="23724888">In order to attempt to cure that, what the Congress did was to put an overlay on top of the same report that was going to be issued by OMB and CBO of the Comptroller General, and the question before the Court in our view on point number two is whether the addition of the Comptroller General serves sufficiently to cure the constitutional defect caused by the Congressional Budget Office being an intimate part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.061" offset="23850798">The defenders of the statute say that the CBO is purely an advisory official; it does nothing but render advice to the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.667" offset="23889146">That, in our view, is an incorrect view of the statute, and indeed, of what has happened under it by the Comptroller General's own affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.773" offset="23925613">And I say that principally because when one normally thinks of an advisor, the key element of an advisor is that you can either take their advice or reject it at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.914" offset="23970125">That is not the case with the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.430" offset="23980261">The Comptroller General's discretion vis-a-vis the two other officials, including OMB and CBO, is that first... and this is in the statute itself... he must give due regard to their findings; second, he must explain fully any deviations that he makes from them; third, the legislative history and the conference report says that the Comptroller General must use his "utmost discretion" before altering any of the findings which they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.003" offset="24114530">In the memorandum to the House and the Senate before the final debate on passage, the report of CBO and OMB was referred to as a "draft order", and as Senator Gramm said in supporting this piece of legislation and the Comptroller General's role, the Comptroller General would be the "final arbiter".</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.184" offset="24203242">Now, that to me does not sound like a pure advisor, and in fact, Congress did one other thing which confirmed the major role they thought that CBO would have, and that is under the fallback mechanism, it doesn't even care what the Comptroller General says about these deficits; it relies solely on the report of OMB and CBO.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.799" offset="24293730">Now, of course, the Comptroller General has the final say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.834" offset="24309822">He is ultimately responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.203" offset="24319330">That is not our bone of contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.322" offset="24327794">What we dispute is whether anyone can fairly characterize this process as purely advisory, particularly since the Comptroller General has put in an affidavit which is in the Joint Appendix saying that throughout this process he consulted consistently with OMB and CBO in order to make the process work, since indeed he has only five days from the time he gets their report in which he is going to issue his final order, and two of those days in each of the first two cycles come on weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.109" offset="24458929">So I respectfully suggest to you that what Congress tried to do here was to keep its hand in the process, to have its budget person continue to be part of the process so that it would not get skewed away from it, and it tried to do that in order to assure that these open-ended standards would be met, and it did it this way and through the Comptroller General who, as Ms. Williams will now explain, remains an important arm of Congress in the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="6859.579" offset="27640852">Absolutely, Your Honor, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.029" offset="27646599">I think that the congressional intent throughout, both the original Congress, the '85 Congress, and, although I haven't researched this thoroughly... remember, there are a number of intervening Congresses who have given power to this Comptroller General as well, and in order to simply drop the removal provision, we would have to assume that each of those Congresses, in giving power to this officer, regarded the removal as incidental and that the critical question for each Congress was the power given no matter who could remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.801" offset="27773763">Now, in the few moments I have left, I would like to turn to the delegation argument, just to... before I do that, let me say one other thing about the 1985 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.424" offset="27820156">In this act, Congress quite naturally turned again to the Comptroller General, again thinking it needed independence, but most emphatically again, what they wanted in this act was independence from the President, as a number of counsel this morning have shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.053" offset="27886716">Congress said, Mr. President, you get no voice in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6924.755" offset="27901554">It would not tolerate giving the functions to an executive branch officer, it made that quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.342" offset="27927885">So we do know what the intent of this Congress is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.278" offset="27939588">The intent was to keep it out of the hands of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.830" offset="27953799">So it made clear that OMB could not do this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.764" offset="27965606">It also carefully excised the only discretion that the President had in the earlier versions of the bill so that now he has no discretion in the implementation of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.072" offset="28002805">He makes virtually no choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.588" offset="28008865">But this is political distrust, this is political distrust, not the institutional concern that we saw in the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6959.428" offset="28040212">The Comptroller General isn't performing his watchdog function here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.713" offset="28053378">He's taking over the executive branch function.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.248" offset="28067484">He's doing the President's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.617" offset="28076992">He's administering the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6970.050" offset="28082739">Because Congress didn't trust the President to administer the law, it gave it to the officer it could trust, and we submit that that decision was fatal to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.472" offset="28116385">Now, just a few points about the delegation arguments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.774" offset="28129655">It is important to see precisely which infirmity in this law we complain of when we talk about undue delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.815" offset="28169779">The delegate decides whether to cut spending at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.851" offset="28185871">This is the effect of the decision, whether to cut spending at all across the board, and how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.838" offset="28205828">This is the heart of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.540" offset="28216695">The act further makes those decisions automatic, and it's the automatic effect, without any approval by elected officials, that make... that creates the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.979" offset="28262462">The forecasting itself is not alone a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7017.162" offset="28271134">And as we have argued, there are differences in kind and degree, but degree is really the central question here, whether Congress has done enough before handing this job off to others.</text>

            <text syncTime="7126.014" offset="28706543">Does it tell the Comptroller General when he has these many choices to make whether be should estimate the deficit in a conservative way, in an extravagant way?</text>

            <text syncTime="7175.831" offset="28905805">With respect to what the Solicitor General has said about the Comptroller General being an officer of Congress, I do not believe that has been the consistent position of the executive or Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.694" offset="28989293">If the Comptroller were a mere officer or agent of Congress, Congress could have appointed him himself... itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7203.116" offset="29014997">Congress decided that it had to be an appointment by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate because the Comptroller was to perform some executive or administrative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7216.191" offset="29067242">There would have been no point to President Wilson's veto, what could he have vetoed, in the Congress reserving to itself the power to remove an officer or agent of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7227.581" offset="29112800">Solicitor General Beck argued in the Myers case that the... this very removal provision was unconstitutional because the Solicitor General was an officer of the executive branch.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="7245.174" offset="29183226">The Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.709" offset="29189391">We are all making, that mistake, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.327" offset="29195869">The present Solicitor General is arguing to you that this removal provision is constitutionally objectionable in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="7256.731" offset="29229410">How could that be so if the Comptroller General were a mere officer or agent of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="7262.652" offset="29253130">In the mid-seventies, Congress considered reserving the appointment of the Comptroller General to itself, and the representative of the Office of Legal Counsel went to Congress and testified you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7277.562" offset="29312793">Congress is... the Comptroller General is performing executive functions, and he must be appointed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7285.251" offset="29343513">And in 1979, the Office of Legal Counsel published an opinion to the effect that the conflict of interest laws apply to the Comptroller General and the GAO as an independent agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7298.141" offset="29395027">In the Buckley case, this Court in a footnote noted that the Comptroller General, despite his appellations, could, as an arm of Congress that occasionally happened, he could perform administrative functions which he was allowed to perform under an earlier version of the Campaign Act, Campaign Financing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7320.007" offset="29482589">And if you will remember, in Springer, which is twice quoted by this Court in Buckley, even if the Comptroller, let us say, were an independent agency within the legislative branch, as you once characterized him in passing, Justice O'Connor, Springer says that an officer appointed by the legislature cannot perform an executive function, but the case might be different if that officer were appointed by the President, by the executive, the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7354.597" offset="29620934">The Solicitor General has made much of the fact that the order, the report the Comptroller issues under the '85 act is to be binding on the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.120" offset="29663043">You will recall that in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Civil Service Commission had ordered the reinstatement of Mr. Fitzgerald, even though the President himself was involved in removing him from office, and Mr. Fitzgerald brought a lawsuit to enforce his right to reinstatement, and that lawsuit was finally settled by the executive branch, and he was given back his old job.</text>
            <text syncTime="7390.853" offset="29765965">Moreover, I would submit that if the President has a constitutional objection to issuing the order after the Comptroller General issues his report, he has recourse under the judicial review provisions set forth in Section 274(d)(2) of the act which speaks of the President issuing a different report, order, than the one that is supposedly required by the Comptroller General's report on the claim or defense that it infringes on his constitutional prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="7427.210" offset="29911311">And that issue is then resolved by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7430.412" offset="29924163">Severance of the removal provision seems to have become a critical issue in the case, and I would submit that Myers is the square precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7441.101" offset="29966899">Myers severed the removal part of a statute relating to the appointment and removal of postmasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7450.639" offset="30005038">The President was allowed to go right on appointing the postmasters, and their functions were not changed in any respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="7457.312" offset="30031787">But there's no doubt that Congress wanted postmasters and that it had no choice but to allow the President to appoint them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7463.549" offset="30056656">I don't see that it is quite the square precedent that you say.</text>

            <text syncTime="7466.085" offset="30066896">Well, we would submit, Justice Rehnquist, that Congress considered in the debates about the override in 1920 whether if they overrode and then the removal provisions were later held invalid by this Court, would the rest of the statute fall, and the floor leader in the House said he thought not.</text>
            <text syncTime="7484.880" offset="30142024">He said that it would fall only to the extent that the statute might be held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="7491.284" offset="30167624">In Senator Howard Baker's brief, he suggested to the Court that this may be the last chance for a statutory solution of this terrible budget deficit problem which is a growing cancer and may soon become inoperable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7510.511" offset="30244529">It's an example of how Congress, dealing with a problem that arguably belonged to both branches, chose this, to repeat again this experiment of using the independent officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7526.373" offset="30307954">It is very important in the history of this country and its development of being able to deal with the complexities of modern government that this Court has not struck down the notion of the independent officer duly appointed by the President.</text>
