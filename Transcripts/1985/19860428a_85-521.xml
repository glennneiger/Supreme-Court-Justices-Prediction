            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="52.967" offset="361804">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.229" offset="386881">From 1950 until 1983, Social Security coverage for state and local government employees was essentially voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.286" offset="419064">Under the statute as it them existed, the states could opt into the Social Security system for groups of their employees and then, complying with certain conditions, opt those coverage groups of employees back out of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.953" offset="469742">By 1983, with the legislation at issue today in this case, it was enacted by Congress, more than nine million of about 13 million state and local government employees were in the Social Security system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="93.193" stopTime="102.539">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="93.193" offset="522718">Does your position, your argument, assume that Congress could have put all of them under Social Security in the first instance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_k_willard" startTime="102.539" stopTime="405.168">
            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="102.539" offset="560125">It certainly does, Mr. Chief Justice, and in fact the District Court assumed arguendo that was the case, and appellees in this case do not argue to the contrary either.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.405" offset="603593">And that really presents the question of what the District Court's holding means, because if the Court's holding meant that the nine million employees now in Social Security coverage had a perpetual right of withdrawal at the instance of their states, it would be quite a sweeping holding that these nine million employees now in Social Security could be pulled out indefinitely whenever their states wanted to pull them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.345" offset="715293">But, as the Chief Justice's question pointed out, that is not the basis for the holding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.819" offset="745177">The Court assumes that Congress could pass a law mandating coverage for all Social Security... for all state and local employees, or presumably a rationally defined subset.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.327" offset="795227">And so, the question is, what is this case about, and it... the answer seems to me, it is about legislative draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.640" offset="816543">That is, the advice we are told is that Congress chose a drafting technique in the statute to make the Section 418 agreements non-terminable.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.867" offset="853428">If Congress had simply ignored the Section 418 agreement, provided for coverage for these employees outside of the pre-existing agreements, then there would be no problem with the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.023" offset="898045">And this quibble about legislative drafting really cannot possibly rise to the level of a constitutional violation, as this Court held in Usery against Turner Elkhorn Mining Company, that the choice of statutory language cannot invalidate this kind of statute when its operation and effect are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.017" offset="974010">Indeed, the option that the appellees would prefer in this case would be more destructive, not less destructive, of vested contract rights because under the mandatory coverage option the Section 418 agreements in their entirety would go out the window, not just one provision, one strand out of the bundle of sticks which has been affected by the 1983 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.400" offset="1055512">If you look at the effect of the 1983 amendments, it is not harsh and oppressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.374" offset="1079440">The states and their employees retain the primary benefit that caused them to opt into coverage of the Social Security system; that is, coverage in a comprehensive scheme of death, disability and retirement benefits for their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.661" offset="1132625">Now, much is made of the financial impact on the state and local governments by requiring their employees to stay in Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.117" offset="1166375">But let's be blunt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.729" offset="1172854">The financial savings to the states from withdrawing their employees from Social Security coverage is brought about because either they provide no benefits to replace the benefits that are lost, or because they provide cheaper benefits to replace the benefits that are lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.628" offset="1232413">The legislative history of 1983 amendments, and I would refer the Court specifically to the 1982 House Ways and Means Committee print, documents that Congress was very concerned about the harm to employees from their employers' terminating Social Security coverage, and the inadequacy of benefits that would be provided, if at all, to the employees who withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.492" offset="1319871">As the statute... the Section 418 agreements previously, which permitted withdrawal of coverage, did not require a referendum or vote of the employees before their coverage was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.411" offset="1371593">It did not require the states to provide a comparable level of benefits to replace those that were being terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.514" offset="1391969">Basically, what it permitted, what the appellees in this case argue, is that whenever the local governments feel they need to save money, and they want to save money by ending Social Security coverage for their employees, then it's okay for them to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.303" offset="1443169">Now, it's not true that all employees are necessarily harmed by the termination of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.718" offset="1468873">Some employees, particularly the older ones, can receive a windfall benefit to the extent their Social Security benefits are rather largely vested by the time coverage is withdrawn, when they can take the money they were putting into Social Security, invest it in some kind of alternative savings or retirement scheme, and then when they get to retirement age they can be double dippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.330" offset="1551316">They can get Social Security benefits which they haven't paid for, once their coverage is withdrawn, and they can get benefits from this alternative program they may have invested into.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.998" offset="1589977">But this is also a problem Congress could take into account, and was motivated by this 1983 amendment, that is, a desire to prevent windfall benefits to some employees as a result of having been in the system for a while and then opting back out of the system, and putting their money somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.810" offset="1661239">These purposes, that is, the purpose of protecting employees from the disadvantages of having coverage withdrawn, and the goal of preventing windfall benefits to other employees whose coverage was terminated, are the very typical kinds of legislative motives which Congress can use to base economic and social legislation, in which this Court routinely sustains with very minimal scrutiny.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="405.168" offset="1770640">Mr. Willard, are there any other public assistance programs subject to agreements like the 418 Agreement?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="412.733" offset="1800837">There are programs that are implemented in a similar way, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.708" offset="1820795">For example, the mini-coverage such as AFDC and so forth are cooperative programs and the states are not required to participate in the programs if they don't want to, and those programs involve similar kinds of conditions, as we argued in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.429" offset="1883698">Now, it is true that this program is somewhat unique in that in 1950 when it was adopted Congress was concerned that there might be a constitutional problem if they mandated coverage of state employees and Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.576" offset="1936256">That problem is one which is no longer considered to be a serious problem, but at the time they did envision a--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="455.012" stopTime="459.135">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="455.012" offset="1970006">Was that because of the Tenth Amendment jurisprudence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_k_willard" startTime="459.135" stopTime="586.420">
            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="459.135" offset="1986516">--That was presumably the problem, Justice O'Connor, that concerned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.399" offset="2003547">Now, we don't think under this Court's Tenth Amendment jurisprudence that that would have been a serious problem, even prior to the Garcia decision, because Social Security involves the taxing and spending power and not the commerce clause power, but in any event there was enough uncertainty that this was to some extent a unique program because of that constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.750" offset="2080974">But in substance, in effect, it is similar to many other kinds of cooperative state-federal programs in that they give... they are based on statutes and the agreements are simply a means of implementing the statutory scheme and not something that has a life of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.161" offset="2142623">And therefore, when Congress changes the economic and social judgment that motivated the scheme, as it did in 1983, this is the kind of change which is not normally brought to destroy some vested rights but instead is an exercise of the kind of judgment which Congress routinely exercises and which this Court routinely defers to Congress on.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.664" offset="2224648">So, the question is really, it seems, how did the district court go so far wrong in this kind of a text, and I think the answer is, it was only by exalting form over substance by applying a very formalistic analysis to the transaction here, that the District Court was able to hold that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.227" offset="2298836">It created in effect a house of cards, and there are a number of defects in its analysis, any one of which serves to unravel the construction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.922" offset="2341676">In the first place, even on the most literal terms, the Section 418 agreements were authorized by the statute and had reference to the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.088" offset="2378352">The right to withdraw or terminate coverage on two years' notice was based on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.633" offset="2404475">It was not something that was negotiated or bargained for in the contractual process.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.227" offset="2426836">It was... the agreement simply tracked the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.651" offset="2444599">California could not have negotiated a different provision even if it had wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.053" offset="2462153">This is simple boilerplate language.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.645" offset="2472498">It was taken out of the statute and put into the agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.355" offset="3559401">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have just been referring to Section 1304 of the Act which provides express notice of Congress's reservation of the right to amend, repeal or alter the Social Security Act, and this was part of the Act at the time the Section 418 agreements were entered into in 1951, and certainly provided notice that the statutory pattern was subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.901" offset="3665562">I'd like to turn now, though, to the question about, even if there was abrogation of a vested contract right, which was important to the parties when it was entered into, whether this constitutes a taking within the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause under this Court's analysis, and I think it is fairly clear that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.246" offset="3750930">The factors that are used by the Court vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.119" offset="3766395">They were most recently restated this term, in Connolly versus Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which reiterated some of the factors, the character of the government action, the economic impact and the interference with reasonable investment-backed expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.210" offset="3830761">In all of these cases, I think when you look at the totality of the Social Security program and the impact of participation in that program by the states, the termination of the right to withdraw is not at such a level as to constitute a taking under this Court's teachings.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.596" offset="3996377">The United States is never bound by provision in its contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.447" offset="4007766">Our position is that the contract here was part of a statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.162" offset="4034620">It was authorized only to the extent that it was consistent with the statutory scheme, and where there was an expressed reservation in the statute of the right to alter and amend the statute, that the parties understood the contract was subject to further modification as part of modification of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.063" offset="4102225">And so, in that sense it's not like a debt contract where you would say the United States would not be authorized to simply repudiate it without regard to the consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.662" offset="4760615">If they were to acquire that, that would have been a contract which would have bargained away governmental authority to could not be bargained away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.399" offset="4799590">The basis of the district court's holding in this case, and the essence of the claim by appellees, is the takings claim; that is, there was a vested contract right here that was taken away, and this was an uncompensated taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.981" offset="4865836">And yet, the purposes of the takings clause are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.712" offset="4880779">As the Court referred to this term in Connolly for the purpose of forbidding uncompensated takings of private property for public use, is to bar the government from forcing some people around to bear public burdens which in all fairness and justice could be borne by the people as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.973" offset="4941801">And actually, that's what the 1983 amendments did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.815" offset="4953190">They are spreading the burdens and benefits of participating in the social welfare scheme to a broad class of employees that otherwise would be given a right to withdraw, and so in that sense what Congress did here is the antithesis of what the takings clause was designed to protect against, in that it spreads a benefit and a burden among a large group of public, rather than causing a small group of people to bear--</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.382" offset="5855459">People who opt in and out of the system can receive this kind of a windfall benefit because their rights may have vested, for many of these employees, and then when they withdraw they got the windfall of keeping Social Security coverage and not having to pay for it, as opposed to many of the employees, the 4 million employees who are not covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.451" offset="6099756">This is a case, in our view, about whether the government needs to keep its promises to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.145" offset="6122535">It is a case about fundamental fairness in state-federal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.950" offset="6141761">In 1951, when this agreement was signed, California was not required to participate in the Social Security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.593" offset="6172272">It could have chosen, as other states did, simply to remain without the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.776" offset="6193066">In order to induce it to participate in the system, the United States made California a good offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.390" offset="6215531">The offer was this: participate in the system, remain for at least five years, and then you can leave on proper notice if you want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.106" offset="6250326">Caliifornia accepted the offer, and they signed a contract with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.790" offset="6273105">That contract is a 1951 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.651" offset="6284599">California lived by its word for 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.915" offset="6301631">Now, when California calls on the United States to uphold its end of the bargain, it is told the promises are no longer binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.502" offset="6579992">First, the contract at issue gave California the right to withdraw from the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.474" offset="6599845">Once outside the system, assuming that mandatory coverage is allowed, that might be imposed on California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.267" offset="6627012">The history of mandatory coverage in this country, the history of the Social Security Act, is that Congress has never in either 1935, not in 1950, not in 1983, decided to impose mandatory coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.937" offset="6681660">It is possible that Congress may at some time in the future decide to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.931" offset="6697647">But until it does, until it makes that decision, the contract right that California gained in the 1951 agreement is quite important.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.470" offset="12143864">With respect to the issue of cooperative federalism, the important point, I think, is this: that under all these programs, under all the programs with which the Court is familiar, it is important that the states be able to take the federal government at its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.738" offset="12200916">It is important that the states be allowed to trust the federal government, and the federal government in return must be able to rely on the states entering into these agreements to administer programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.183" offset="12466633">So, far from simply omitting it, it is something that was considered and rejected by the framers, as this Court's unanimous opinion in R. A. Gray noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.946" offset="12501742">In comparing the contract situation with the constraints on the federal government's repudiation on debt as brought about in the Lynch case, I think we can see some real comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.947" offset="12557748">In Lynch we had a situation where we had a contractual scheme that was repudiated outright by the government by simply repealing the authorizing statute, thus in effect repudiating the debt totally and leaving nothing in its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.724" offset="12608844">And in fact, the Solicitor General in the Lynch case refused to offer any kind of police power or public welfare justification for the repudiation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.775" offset="12861082">But it's quite different because, for example, suppose that Congress had repealed Section 418 outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.950" offset="12885742">No one would claim that the states would have a right to insist on participating in Social Security if Section 418 were repealed, and the Social Security program were terminated in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.397" offset="12923567">That would have rendered those agreements totally worthless, and yet they could have been repealed outright and there wouldn't have been a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.222" offset="12954810">The fact here is that Congress did something milder, much less of a violence to the contract, because they simply repealed... one provision was rendered moot, not the entire contractual scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.499" offset="13003920">And so, here the reservation of right to do this is much less inclusive than what Congress could have done, and which the appellees in this case don't really disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.185" offset="13038715">The important thing to keep in mind, though, is that it's not simply repudiation of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.979" offset="13061912">Congress made a judgment there was a public welfare purpose to be served for the benefit of the employees of state and local governments, of keeping them in Social Security coverage, that if your employers wanted to save money by terminating your Social Security coverage, that that was a bad thing, that for the benefit of the welfare of the employees as well as for the integrity of the Social Security system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.871" offset="13425432">They were receiving coverage that was less comprehensive than Social Security coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.954" offset="13449778">Social Security coverage goes with you from job to job, whereas coverage in a state or local pension plan may not go with you if you moved outside of coverage, and the legislative history shows that Congress was concerned about the lack of portability of benefits, especially for younger employees who would be very seriously disadvantaged if they didn't have Social Security coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.606" offset="13528354">That, after all, is the rationale for having a nearly universal social insurance scheme, because it provides a level of benefits to people, whether they move from one job to another or not.</text>
