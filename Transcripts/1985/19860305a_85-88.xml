            <text syncTime="13.496" offset="186913">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.245" offset="201959">The issue in this case is whether the Pennsylvania statute of limitations of six years from birth in a support action for illegitimate children violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where no similar restriction exists in support actions for legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.797" offset="292134">There are two points to be made: first, the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.467" offset="314808">It treats legitimate and illegitimate children differently without a substantial state interest for such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.198" offset="349708">In particular, the only conceivable state interest of protection from stale and fraudulent claims is clearly weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.100" offset="389309">Current scientific procedures are sufficiently precise so that the risk of false paternity charges in no sense balances against unfair loss of support for illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.359" offset="450332">Secondly, this case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.154" offset="465587">Although current Pennsylvania law establishes an 18-year statute of limitations in response to federal law, the law operates only from December 1st of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.431" offset="518668">Pennsylvania precedent suggests that the new law does not apply retroactively to a back child support award so that the illegitimate child in this case would lose all right to child support from the date of filing of the complaint in this action, February 11th of 1980.</text>

            <label>Ms. Esther L. Hornik</label>
            <text syncTime="556.682" offset="2359674">But the old statute... well, okay, the old statute was enacted in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.334" offset="2406276">For example, in this case, this child was born in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.270" offset="2434070">Now, in Williams versus Wolfe the Court was considering the retroactivity of a statute of limitations, and if you look at the facts in that case the child was already six years old in 1979 when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.918" offset="2500630">And so, what the Court was asking is, can we apply a newly enacted statute of limitations of six years to a case which has been filed one year after the effective date of this Act, and the child was already five at the age of the enactment of any statute, and the Court ruled that the date of the complaint determined the law that would be applied in the case, not the date that the child was born, and not the effective date of the Act, but the effective date that the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.448" offset="2662694">Georgeann Veronica Paulussen was born on today's date, March 5th, in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.257" offset="2705953">At the time of Georgeann's birth her mother, Barbara Paulussen and her putative father, George Ronald Herion, were not married to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.817" offset="2740225">Georgeann's mother and father continued to have a relationship through April of 1975, and throughout this time George Herion made voluntary contributions to Georgeann's support, and then in April of 1975 all support ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.543" offset="2811069">Barbara Paulussen filed a paternity action on behalf of Georgeann in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County on February 11th of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.523" offset="2855060">In this complaint George Herion is named as her father.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.100" offset="2869375">George Herion immediately raised at bar the six-year statute of limitations to Georgeann's claim, pleading that the case was filed more than six years after Georgeann's birth and more than two years after he had made voluntary contributions to her support.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.093" offset="2933323">There was no trial on the merits of Georgeann's claim in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.436" offset="2954638">By operation of law, she was barred from presenting her evidence to a tryer of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.916" offset="2980656">Her evidence included results of red and white blood tests in which samples had been taken from her, from her mother, Barbara Paulussen, and from George Herion.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.349" offset="3038335">The results of these tests indicated that there was a 99.8 probability that George Herion was the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.314" offset="3066234">Cross motions for summary judgment were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.438" offset="3082743">The mother's motion challenged the constitutionality of the six-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.983" offset="3104895">The father's motion raised the bar of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.950" offset="3116702">The lower court granted the father's motion, George Herion, and denied Barbara Paulussen's motion thereby dismissing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.585" offset="3167275">The matter was then appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania where again Barbara Paulussen's constitutional challenge was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.254" offset="3197995">A Petition for Allowance of Appeal was filed in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.909" offset="3216594">It too was denied and the appeal to this Court followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.720" offset="3231850">The Superior Court of Pennsylvania ruled against Barbara Paulussen on the basis of a Pennsylvania precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.077" offset="3257241">In the Pennsylvania Supreme Court case of Astemborski versus Sasmalzki, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the six-year statute, and the Superior Court, being a lower court, felt compelled to follow the precedent of the higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.614" offset="3347416">The Astemborski case had... the Astemborski court had initially considered the constitutionality of the six-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.828" offset="3392242">A petition for certiorari was granted by this Court, and then Judgment was vacated and the case was remanded back to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for consideration in light of this Court's decision in Pickett versus Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.633" offset="3459429">The Astemborski court reconsidered the constitutional question in light of this Court's decision and reaffirmed its original decision, finding the six-year statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.721" offset="3515853">In Mills, this Court struck down a one-year statute of limitations from Texas as constitutionally invalid, and in Pickett a unanimous court struck down a two-year statute of limitations on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.808" offset="3588160">In Mills and in Pickett this Court established a two-part test for analysis of the constitutionality of a paternity statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.492" offset="3622955">There had to be an adequate time frame for a paternity action to be instituted on behalf of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.771" offset="3652003">There had to be a substantial state interest in avoiding stale and fraudulent claims to justify the discriminatory impact of this statute on the rights of illegitimate children, and other countervailing state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.390" offset="3710518">Despite these guidelines for constitutional analysis, the Astemborski court found that the Pennsylvania six-year statute was constitutionally adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.136" offset="3757538">The holding of the Astemborski court was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.899" offset="3772585">First, is six years a constitutionally adequate length of time to bring a paternity action?</text>
            <text syncTime="917.536" offset="3803096">The answer must be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.410" offset="3810619">First, the child, Georgeann Paulussen, is a real party in interest here although her mother's name appears in the caption, and there can be no assurance that her interest is identical to her mother's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.170" offset="3873626">The child cannot act on her own behalf but she loses important rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.605" offset="3891389">She cannot toddle into court to find her Daddy.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.885" offset="3908526">Her mother may be unwilling to sue in a timely fashion for her own reasons, whether these reasons be out of hate, love or utter indifference to the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.022" offset="3944993">The mother's feelings can continue for many years, even if the father makes voluntary contributions to the support of the child or acknowledges the child's paternity in writing after the six-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.032" offset="3997029">Second, the financial needs of a minor child are not always predictable before he or she is six.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.139" offset="4029525">A child may not require her father's financial assistance at age five, but at age 12 or age 17 may be in desperate need of such assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.759" offset="4076023">As to the second prong of the test suggested by this Court, does the prevention of stale and fraudulent claims counterbalance the interest of the child and the countervailing interest of the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="999.800" offset="4132134">We present this issue by issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.768" offset="4139971">Is the prevention of stale claims really an issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.219" offset="4157838">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.125" offset="4161496">Can an illegitimate child's claim for ongoing financial support be considered stale?</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.355" offset="4198380">The claim of a legitimate child is not considered stale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.338" offset="4214263">Then, is the prevention of fraudulent claims a substantial state interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.993" offset="4240908">As this Court has noted, advances in scientific testing have attenuated the relationship between the statute of limitations and the State's interest in the prevention of prosecution of stale and fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.095" offset="4305274">In the Congressional report accompanying the Child Support Enforcement amendment of 1985, it was noted that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.201" offset="4337770">"Increased reliability of scientific paternity testing can exclude over 99 percent of those wrongfully accused fathers, regardless of the age of the child. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.650" offset="4383536">Pennsylvania recognizes that the results of HLA testing are so reliable that they can be introduced as affirmative evidence of paternity in a paternity proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.159" offset="4437558">In our concern over the prevention of fraudulent claims, it should be recalled that in addition to the right to call upon powerful scientific tests, the accused father does not lose other defenses in contesting paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.621" offset="4503386">The accused father has the right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.792" offset="4516134">If indigent, the accused father has the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.572" offset="4539226">If indigent, the accused father has the right to free blood tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.866" offset="4560438">The accused father has the right to have the petition dismissed immediately if blood tests and tissue tests show that he is excluded as the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.845" offset="4608294">If the father is not indigent, then he has the right to be notified that he can have counsel at the proceeding and he has to be given an adequate amount of time to secure such counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.465" offset="4666808">Also, the accused father can appeal the lower court decision on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.383" offset="4698469">And it's clear in another context that Pennsylvania recognizes that it is possible to establish paternity well after six years have passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.255" offset="4737966">An illegitimate child can probe paternity after the father is dead, for purposes of intestate succession, if he or she can show paternity by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.264" offset="4793972">Ironically, more liberal rights are given to a child after the after the lips of his father have been sealed by death than when the father is alive to contest the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.353" offset="4842351">In sum, it is Barbara Paulussen's belief that the state interest in preventing stale and fraudulent claims is now as it was in 1980, quite minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.566" offset="4899194">In contrast the countervailing state interest and the child's interest in the timely determination of paternity are much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.219" offset="4929809">As this Court has noted, there is a substantial countervailing state interest in seeing that justice is done and genuine claims for child support are litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.871" offset="4972441">This conflicts with the arbitrary nature of a limitations period, that provides no exceptions for determination of a child's paternity after the statutory deadline has passed, based on either the case's unique facts and circumstances, or the quantity or quality of the evidence that a particular child can produce to prove that a particular man is its father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.127" offset="5069407">Another countervailing state interest requires consideration of the cost benefit of a statute which grants financial immunity to a father for support obligations and possibly shifts that support obligation to taxpayers when the child's mother is unable to support the illegitimate child, or is not adequately able to support the illegitimate child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.146" offset="5193541">That's correct, and in Pennsylvania a child beyond the age of 18 has a right to ask the father for child support if she needs money for college expenses, if she's impoverished or disabled, and so that the right for a legitimate child could continue on throughout the father's lifetime, and so that even under the 18-year statute, I believe that there is an equal protection problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.472" offset="5362815">Justice Rehnquist, that's correct, but the illegitimate child never has the same procedure as the legitimate child because the illegitimate child has a two-part procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.187" offset="5409731">For every case of an illegitimate child, you have to go through a paternity proceeding and then a support proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.949" offset="5436689">A paternity proceeding is a safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.933" offset="5444630">If you can't make it through the paternity proceeding, you don't go on to the support proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.305" offset="5466155">Whereas, for the legitimate child, because of the presumptions that operate in favor of legitimacy, all a legitimate child has to do is say, my parents were married, you know, at the time I was conceived or at the time I was born, or my parents were married after I was born, and I'm legitimate so I have the right to proceed to--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1352.422" offset="5542642">Well, that was really my point, that there is this separate issue in the case of the illegitimate child that might justify a state in treating that sort of issue and the time you can raise it differently, and all you're arguing about, really, are the assets of the father and the needs of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.321" offset="5614217">--Well, the thing is that the procedure itself is a safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.788" offset="5636056">In other words, as long as... in other words, the legitimate child and illegitimate child should have equal opportunity to ask for a father's support, and if a legitimate child has through age 50, to ask for a father's support, then the illegitimate child should have the same time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.530" offset="5715050">However, the illegitimate child will always have the burden of proving paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.638" offset="5735530">Now, as I stated before, over 99 percent of fathers today can be excluded by tests as potential fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.226" offset="5781819">So that you're looking at a fractional class of fathers whose rights are being affected here, one percent are going to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.896" offset="5812539">Whereas, you have the entire class of illegitimates which is over 18 percent now, of all births in the United States, are children born out of wedlock, which I believe the last statistic was that over 700,000 children being born out of wedlock each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.887" offset="5888503">Finally, the interests of the child are sacrificed, and the interest here... the child's interests are paramount and I think that that's out of focus in the way that these cases are being analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.836" offset="5936255">And the child's interests are far more substantial than any risks associated with a post-six year paternity suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.535" offset="5971050">There is clear discrimination in the statute against an illegitimate child, and this Court has stated very clearly in many opinions that there must be special concern shown for an illegitimate child, and there are statutes that have classifications based on illegitimacy, are subject to a heigtened level of scrutiny, because an illegitimate child is not responsible for his or her status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.820" offset="6076271">It's the parents who produced the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.929" offset="6088705">Had Georgeann been considered a legitimate child on the date that her support petition was filed, she would have been receiving support from both of her parents in accordance with their means and needs as determined by a court using a best interest of the child standard, and she would have been receiving support from February of 1980, unlike in this case where she has never received one penny of support from her father because she's never had an opportunity to litigate the paternity case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.367" offset="7314371">With respect to the fact finding issue, it is of course true that scientific tasting has reduced the possibility of false accusations of paternity, but the new scientific tests, including the HLA test which is used in Pennsylvania, is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.016" offset="7393052">The leading study, the one cited by amici, the Terasaki study of 1,000 people, shows that in ten percent of those cases the HLA test could make no resolution at all, and in the other cases where it did indicate probatively that the defendant was the rather, the degree of probability ranged from 90 percent to higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.788" offset="7480092">There is no court in the United States which treats HLA tests as conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.848" offset="7504333">To the contrary, all of them permit a defendant to submit evidence on such issues as non-access to the mother during the relevant time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.344" offset="7546338">What kind of evidence must the defendant rely on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.609" offset="7559399">Obviously, he must rely on witnesses who are available, on the memory of those witnesses and his own memory, and in some cases, of course, he must rely on documentary evidence like appointment calendars, credit card records and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.071" offset="7613212">There can be no question that the accuracy and reliability of that evidence diminishes over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.913" offset="7644558">It is far more difficult for a defendant to reconstruct his activities and the activities of the mother six years or ten years after the event than it would be for him to reconstruct those activities one year, two years, or three years after the event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.145" offset="9373551">In other words, any child, a legitimate child or illegitimate child who was involved in a slip and fall case had a two year statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.981" offset="9440843">It also demonstrates that you cannot say that Pennsylvania was somehow singling out paternity actions and discriminating against paternity actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.275" offset="9482012">To the contrary, the six-year statute of limitations, in effect, the paternity action in 1980, was substantially longer than the two-year statute of limitations that was in affect for tort cases, for illegitimate or legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.127" offset="9541466">Now, it is true that in 1984 Pennsylvania changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.595" offset="9563305">It did adopt, like many other states, a general totalling provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.935" offset="9580650">The question then becomes whether, when Pennsylvania eliminated the statute of limitations for infants, in most general cases, did it also have to eliminate the six-year statute of limitation for paternity actions, and we submit that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.070" offset="9641254">There are very different interests at stake in a paternity action situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2626.207" offset="10637773">In the state of Pennsylvania, if a mother is on welfare, the Department of Public Welfare will provide legal assistance to bring a paternity and a child support action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.957" offset="10788761">Now, this Court has suggested that there are other barriers that a mother may face, personal, psychological barriers that might inhibit her from bringing a suit within six years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.348" offset="11094289">The father is paying... or if the defendant is even paying a dollar of rent, he presumably is helping to contribute to the support of the child, and as long as that is true the mother is not bound by the six-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.873" offset="11148415">She can sue two years after the defendant's support stops.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.852" offset="11352379">--Pennsylvania changed the law... the short answer, I think, is that it was required to do so in order to receive AFDC money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.272" offset="11382054">As you know, in 1984 Congress enacted a law which said that unless a state moves to an 18-year statute of limitations, it would be deprived of AFDC money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.627" offset="11423432">Although I don't know the exact amount of AFDC money that Pennsylvania receives, I assume that it's in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.890" offset="11448509">Therefore, Pennsylvania and I assume every other state in the union will now move to an 18-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.622" offset="11475468">That may in fact be a good policy judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.620" offset="11487380">All I am arguing here is that the State of Pennsylvania prior to that was not required constitutionally to have an 18-year statute, that it could have a six-year statute, and that such a statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.911" offset="11544640">If you have no further questions, I conclude my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.064" offset="11581212">In my opponent's argument, first of all it seems to be more like a due process argument in favor of fathers, rather than the issue that's before this Court, is how legitimate children are treated differently than illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.806" offset="11648189">And who is to say that every birth of every child is a planned event?</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.429" offset="11666684">You can have families where the parents are married and they can have a surprise child, and then they have to plan for the financial future of that child, and so that, this kind of argument that a father... that especially a father who has been engaging in sexual relations outside of the bounds of matrimony gets financial immunity if someone happens to haul him into court after six years, is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.138" offset="11777548">Now, this Court has pointed out that in this kind of situation the children's interest... the child's interest is paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.370" offset="11806387">Not one word here was said about the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.946" offset="11816732">What about the social embarrassment of the illegitimate child?</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.351" offset="11830315">What about the child who is given a school assignment to fill out his family tree and she can only fill out one branch, her mother's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.332" offset="11858318">She has nothing to put on her father's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.410" offset="11866573">And so that, an illegitimate child, because of what the father has done, his irresponsibility, is stuck with the consequences and if you can follow that argument, that the statute of limitations is supposed to work as a statute of repose for the father, it's plainly unfair and doesn't balance against the interests of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.635" offset="11955494">In closing, I would like to state that this statute of limitations is a violation of the due process... pardon me, of the right to equal protection of an illegitimate child, and I would urge this Court to find the six-year statute of limitations unconstitutional, and reverse the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.094" offset="12053296">Thank you.</text>
