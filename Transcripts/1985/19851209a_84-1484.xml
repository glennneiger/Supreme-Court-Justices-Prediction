            <text syncTime="29.151" offset="246892">The ground of the decision was pre-emption under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.995" offset="270298">The statutes in question function together as a single unit to direct the purchasing agent of the State, when purchasing goods for the internal needs of the State, not to buy the goods of violators of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.717" offset="349188">Those NLRA violators are defined by our statute as those who have been adjudicated by the federal courts three times in a five year period to have violated the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.275" offset="403418">The consequence of being an NLRA violator as defined is that the purchasing agent may not acquire state goods from those violators for a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.822" offset="449602">This directive aims only at the state purchasing decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.086" offset="654716">The other side of the same coin, namely, if we're going to reward those employers who are exemplary by giving them our business, we necessarily will decide that we do not want to encourage labor law violations by giving those violators our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.797" offset="717514">In either event, it remains a purchasing decision, where we are buying our goods for our purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.515" offset="756384">To shape the issue with some more precision, we want to be able to make the choice, the choice consumers generally enjoy, the choice trading partners in the private sector enjoy when they are engaged in proprietary conduct, to make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.058" offset="838618">We want to give our business to those employers, those companies, that demonstrate the best in corporate America and we would rather not have to hire people who have violated the labor laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles D. Hoornstra</label>
            <text syncTime="322.501" offset="1420313">Well, permit me first to say that those questions, I believe, are all Fourteenth Amendment questions, not NLRA pre-emption questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.330" offset="1471617">It may be that our statute is subject to infirmity for those reasons, but not for NLRA pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.998" offset="1510278">Let me turn more directly to the question of whether it's a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.390" offset="1531908">In response to Justice O'Connor's question, I think we have to concede that the opposite side of the coin, of the same coin, of trying to reward the best in corporate America, is that you're going to have as an effect the same thing as though a penalty were exacted on the violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.260" offset="1591362">The effect is the same only in this respect, and it's a narrow effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.842" offset="1609753">That is that they are going to have a lost business profit-making opportunity, but it stops and it starts right there, and I think I can demonstrate that this is not a penalty within the remedial concept of the NLRA and the machinery of the NLRB by a number of different considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.225" offset="1691255">First is, Your Honor, that question wouldn't arise, were a private employer, a private company standing here rather than the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.432" offset="1724064">It wouldn't arise because we instantly would discern a distinction between the economic pain that befalls someone who has lost a customer, from a regulatory penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.009" offset="1774324">We can admit the effect is the same in other respects, but there is that distinction, that we would say if a private employer were here, that is an economic pain, not a remedial penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.817" offset="1821553">Second, I think that as the holding of this Court in Camden crystallized the meaning of the market participant cases, insofar as the state does act as a proprietor or as a consumer, there can be... there can be no conflict or interference with the federal regulatory machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.520" offset="1904414">Further, this Court in the withdrawal of subsidization cases has held that a penalty is not involved if a sovereign state or the federal government withdraws subsidy for the exercise of even a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.503" offset="1976303">I'm referring to the McRae v. Harris, Buckley, Regan line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.655" offset="1996992">Now, obviously we are well within the circumference of that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.308" offset="2019562">First we are not refusing to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.404" offset="2043908">We are simply declining to enter into a voluntary agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.204" offset="2055193">Second, there isn't a fundamental constitutional right involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.060" offset="2078598">There is, to be sure, a valued right, a very valued right, and that is the right of a consumer to make its choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.903" offset="2105975">It is the right of a proprietor to choose its trading partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.855" offset="2117782">And that is our right.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.048" offset="2126559">Finally, in respect to the question, Justice Blackmun, whether it is a penalty, there is this very easy conceptual difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.125" offset="2170863">We are not taking money from a particular company to put it into our treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.200" offset="2203150">That is what the gist of a penalty is.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.400" offset="2203986">We are taking money from our treasury, and the question is which of two companies are we going to spend it on, and that's why we come back to the two sides of the coin analog I used earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.970" offset="2518187">I would have to speculate on the political motives and of course, as Your Honor appreciates, we judge legislation and its purpose by what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.615" offset="2552773">It is an infrequent occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.120" offset="2570850">There are some other parallels in other states, and I think its infrequency probably accounts for the fact that Congress has not had occasion to address this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.548" offset="2624557">But in explaining that, and admitting that, we are saying that Congress did not address it and that, of course, in any pre-emption case is the touchstone, did Congress address this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.666" offset="2673041">We have two premises that underlie our basic argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.330" offset="2691640">One, any private company could do exactly what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.304" offset="2715568">It would be free under the National Labor Relations Act to do exactly what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.257" offset="2735317">Any private consumer could make exactly this precise choice, and I believe that is conceded by the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.641" offset="2764887">Second, the second premise is, the states enjoy the same rights as any private company when it's doing the same thing, namely making a proprietary choice or a consumer choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.199" offset="2823088">There are two sources for this second premise, because that I want to dwell on inasmuch as the appellee does not concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.215" offset="2851196">First, the dormant Commerce Clause cases expressly have held that the states, when operating in the free market, may operate freely and as stated in Reeves specifically, evenhandedness as a matter of federalism, evenhandedness requires that states operate as free from federal constraint as a private company.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.182" offset="2955059">So, simply as a general matter of our federalism, when we're doing exactly what the private sector regularly does and have on our proprietor hat, we have the same freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.538" offset="3000512">Of course, that may be true under the dormant Commerce Clause and not true where Congress has affirmatively enacted a law such as the NLRA, I suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.936" offset="3042099">I come to my second source because of exactly that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.709" offset="3053175">The next logical question is, that might be true as a general matter, but is it true in an NLRA situation, and I think the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.374" offset="3087865">First, as noted, the private company could do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.697" offset="3109077">Second, there is nothing on the face of the NLRA to distinguish the states acting as proprietors from the private companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.363" offset="3139797">Third, I think this Court specifically has put the states in the position of the protected proprietor and the protected consumer in the NLRA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.829" offset="3181697">I have in mind as a lead case the 1959 decision of this Court, Plumbers versus Poor County, where one of our... which, incidentally, is a Wisconsin county, one of our counties was building a courthouse and it was victimized by what we call secondary boycott activity of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.371" offset="3259855">The question is, is the state or a political subdivision within that principle of secondary boycott law when it's trying to build its buildings, that it preserves its own freedom of choice of a trader, or is the state, because it's a state or a political subdivision removed from these protections of neutrals in the business economy who are to be free from this kind of union coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.209" offset="3367166">This Court clearly held that even though states and political subdivisions are not employers covered by the Act, and even though there is what we call the Garmon pre-emption doctrine, when it comes to preserving the freedom of choice that the secondary boycott law is all about, the states and the political subdivisions enjoy those same benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.144" offset="3446892">May I give this example to further illustrate that the states under the NLRA, Justice Rehnquist, enjoy the same prerogatives as though there weren't an NLRA when it comes to proprietary choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.340" offset="3499659">Were Gould's union to appeal to the officials of the State of Wisconsin, please don't do business with Gould because we've got a union labor dispute, that would be protected activity by the union under this Court's Cervette doctrine going back 25 years now, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.155" offset="3578967">The reason it would be protected, and the union could appeal to Wisconsin not to do business with its employer, is because Wisconsin in that circumstance is in the position of a proprietor, a business person making a business choice, and that appeal could be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.960" offset="8258125">Most telling was the brief in opposition to the plaintiff's notion for summary judgment which appears at R-24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.776" offset="8293442">At page 16 of that document Wisconsin said, explaining why it was not bound by what the Congress had done in rejecting penalties under the statute, it said:</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.253" offset="8347359">"Whether Wisconsin was wise in its policy of enacting state debarment procedures for its contracts is not relevant here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.971" offset="8382259">The fact is that its views are different from Congress's on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.063" offset="8402634">I think it's obvious, therefore, that the purpose of this statute is not merely the state declining to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.190" offset="8443072">It has to be recognized that the purpose of that declining to do business is not some legitimate state economic interest but merely to seek enforcement of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.877" offset="8489883">This is also clear from the statute itself, again addressing myself to Justice O'Connor's questions and points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.703" offset="8521126">This statute is not limited to current labor disputes between an employer and a union where the state makes the judgment that this labor dispute will interfere with the performance of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.542" offset="8576505">Thus, the state in that type of situation could make the judgment that the labor dispute might affect performance and therefore the state would have a legitimate economic interest in the statute... in the labor dispute which may underpin the statutory violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.521" offset="8820384">That is a far cry from enacting a statute which prohibits doing business with a particular classification of employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.338" offset="8855702">I suggest that that is more like Section 8-E of the National Labor Relations Act which prohibits private traders from entering into agreements with the union, to cease doing business with some third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.256" offset="8907320">That situation is very much akin, I think, to the passage of a statute which prohibits the dealing with a particular classification of employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.125" offset="9690784">Let us address the market participant exception because I think it becomes clear from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.257" offset="9711369">When a state is the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause is premised upon the concept that the state, acting in its own economic self-interest, can use its treasury for the benefit of its own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.837" offset="9769674">That is the one theme that is consistent in every market participant exception case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.840" offset="9789736">In fact, the legitimate state interest to be served by the exercise of the spending power in those cases is favoritism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.135" offset="9818889">But once you take the market participant exception and its limited recognition of the fact that within the dormant Commerce Clause there is a difference between direct regulation and indirect action, once you take the market participant concept outside the dormant Commerce Clause, you lose completely the legitimate state interest that underpins the market participant exception of acting in one's own legitimate economic self-interest, spending for the benefit of one's citizens who fund that treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.949" offset="9954099">Outside of the dormant Commerce Clause, that rationale ceases to exist and the market participant exception becomes an unrestricted principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.698" offset="10133090">--I think that presents a far closer case than the case at bar, because at least in that case the state could argue that it has a legitimate economic self-interest in not dealing with an employer that has a lot of labor disputes because it's concluded, it's determined, that individual is an unreliable contractor--</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.142" offset="10222951">But it's important to note, Your Honor, that in this case this statute makes no such classification, provides and permits of no such distinction or judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.041" offset="10266523">Indeed, the court of appeals said that the very fact that this statute did not provide for any administrative determinations of that type only underscored the penal nature of the statute, and by penal I mean debarring an employer for a violation of law, not because of any economic consequences to the state or within the state, but simply because there was a violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.695" offset="10365162">The instant case provides an excellent example of what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.342" offset="10403718">Gould did not commit any unfair labor practice in connection with the performance of any state contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.359" offset="10439767">Gould did not engage in any labor dispute that was connected to or related to any contract with the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.674" offset="10485011">Gould did not have a history of, or the divisions with which the State of Wisconsin was dealing, did not have a history of labor disputes which would affect or might be deemed to affect the ability of Gould to perform its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.468" offset="10564215">In fact, the divisions with which the State of Wisconsin was doing business were not even those that were found to be guilty of the unfair labor practices which resulted in Gould's debarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.967" offset="10618236">Indeed, the divisions which Gould... of Gould which committed the unfair labor practices were divested by Gould prior to the time of the debarment, although I don't mean to suggest that was the reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.397" offset="10679885">And, all of the unfair labor practices which resulted in Gould's debarment had been remedied with the exception of one, by the time of the passage of the law and that one was remedied prior to any debarment of Gould under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.431" offset="10760028">There was, in fact, no labor dispute conduct that the state could look at and say, this will affect the performance of these contracts and therefore we have a legitimate self-interest, economic self-interest, in not doing business with this particular employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.463" offset="10840172">They debarred Gould because Gould was an unfair labor practice violator, expressly for the reasons that they have admitted below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.749" offset="10877370">They want to encourage compliance with the National Labor Relations Act by debarring those who have engaged in violation, regardless of the nature, extent, duration or type of violation, without any state economic interest to justify that involvement or concern with the labor conduct of the particular employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.733" offset="10969217">I have already addressed the right of appeal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.699" offset="10997116">I would like to spend some time focusing on the penal aspect of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.682" offset="11017073">This, and lesser federal courts, have repeatedly recognized that the National Labor Relations Act is remedial in nature, and that it eschews any reliance upon penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.042" offset="11082484">This Court and lesser federal courts have repeatedly recognized that even the provision of additional remedies under the National Labor Relations act by states for conduct that amounts to a violation of the National Labor Relations Act would interfere with the federal statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.755" offset="11165344">In Garner, in Garmon, in Lockridge, in Jones and in Farmer, this Court has so said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.841" offset="11193661">A fortiori, if the state imposes a penalty for violation of the National Labor Relations Act, it is definitely interfering with the federal statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.011" offset="11246428">Affirmance in this case entails... which is what we see... entails a very narrow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.276" offset="11295434">Affirmance does not entail any further incursion of state sovereign rights beyond that which has already been declared to be the limitations on sovereignty dictated by the Supremacy Clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.346" offset="11355725">Reversal, on the other hand, would entail the creation of a major new exception to the Supremacy Clause which has never heretofore been recognized by this or any other federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.458" offset="11412149">It is no accident that the state finds it necessary to rely upon the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.473" offset="11448198">Make no mistake about it, what the state seeks is the creation of a major exception to the Supremacy Clause.</text>
