            <label>Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="13.964" offset="198550">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the defendants in this case were apprehended in November, 1975, illegally transporting dynamite and firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.773" offset="241808">They have thus far successfully avoided trial by filing an extensive series of pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.724" offset="265632">In 1983, the District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the accrued delay violated the speedy trial clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.297" offset="299905">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, and we are here on certiorari for a review of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.606" offset="329162">The defendants were arrested while traveling in a motor home and a station wagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.965" offset="350582">In the station wagon were 350 pounds of dynamite, several time bombs, and a loaded revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.493" offset="376705">In the motor home were blasting caps, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, several empty hand grenades, and eight firearms with chliterated serial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.209" offset="419545">The defendants were promptly indicted on charges of unlawful possession and transportation of explosives and firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.394" offset="444310">Following their indictment, the defendants began filing numerous pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.799" offset="465939">One motion sought suppression of evidence of the dynamite which had been destroyed by state law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.390" offset="496241">The District Court granted the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.529" offset="504809">The government appealed the suppression order, but the defendants in the District Court sought to force the government to go to trial without the suppressed evidence while the appeal was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.009" offset="546710">The defendants did not ask for and the District Court did not order a severance of the dynamite and firearms counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.709" offset="573563">When the government declined to go to trial without the suppressed evidence, the District Court dismissed the indictment with prejudice under Rule 48(b) for what it termed unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.690" offset="617449">The government appealed, and its appeal was consolidated with that from the suppression order.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.423" offset="636362">The defendants were completely free of all restraints during the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.780" offset="653812">A panel of the Court of Appeals initially affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reheard the case en banc and reversed the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.339" offset="692055">In comprehensive majority and concurring opinions, the Court of Appeals set forth guiding rules for cases, criminal cases in which evidence has been lost or destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.647" offset="741270">The defendants unsuccessfully sought rehearing and certiorari on an interlocutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.738" offset="761645">When the case returned to the District Court in 1980, the defendants resumed their motion practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.143" offset="783274">They successfully required the government to reindict, and they sought a number of extensions of time in which to file further pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.515" offset="816711">At one time almost two dozen of these motions were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.279" offset="831862">The District Court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds of vindictive prosecution as to defendant Ka Mook Banks, and denied the vindictive prosecution motions of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.413" offset="884316">Both sides appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.741" offset="889645">Once again the defendants were free of all restraints during the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.274" offset="1031751">The defendant can also be subject to bail, travel restrictions, reporting restrictions, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.631" offset="1053276">The defendants were not in this case, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.833" offset="1062053">The Court of Appeals issued its opinion shortly after this Court's opinions in United States versus Goodwin and United States versus Hollywood Motor Car, which were dispositive of the issues raised on the appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.484" offset="1116597">Once again, it ruled in favor of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.748" offset="1129658">It reversed the dismissal of the indictment as to Ka Mook Banks, and it dismissed the appeals of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.590" offset="1153064">Once again, the defendant sought rehearing and certiorari, entailing another several months of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.274" offset="1183784">On remand in the District Court in 1983, the defendants continued to file additional motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.318" offset="1207921">This time the District Court dismissed the indictment on speedy trial grounds, and the government appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.802" offset="1225893">The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.424" offset="1244388">It purported to excuse certain periods of the delay that had taken place, but it ultimately counted the entire 75 months that the case had been pending on appeal as part of the delay, and had found that this length of the delay was</text>
            <text syncTime="289.981" offset="1302589">"the most weighty factor by far. "</text>
            <text syncTime="291.715" offset="1309590">in its balancing of the relevant factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.870" offset="1322128">Judge Wallace dissented from the Court of Appeals decision on the basis of this Court's second decision in United States versus McDonald, which he reasoned required exclusion of the time on appeal when the defendants were not under indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.599" offset="1377090">There are two basic points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.176" offset="1387434">First, wholly apart from how appeal time should as a general matter be analyzed under the speedy trial clause, it would make a mockery of the Sixth Amendment to hold that these defendants have been denied their right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.357" offset="1436127">Nothing could be plainer than that far from seeking a speedy trial, they were doing everything in their power to avoid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.262" offset="1463712">They have filed literally dozens of pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.370" offset="1476146">The docket sheets alone fill most of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.572" offset="1488999">Among these filings were a motion for appointment of a native American judge, a motion to dismiss the indictment in part on the ground that persons with hearing impairments have been excluded from the grand jury, and a motion arguing that the defendant's right to a public trial would be violated unless they were tried in a facility larger than any of the available courtrooms.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.198" offset="2715500">The ways that would require justification if they took place in the District Court do not require justification in the Court of Appeals, and this time also must be... the context in which the time arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.028" offset="2846843">They do typically rule faster, and they are not required to formulate binding precedential rules for other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.823" offset="2877981">I think the very institutional functions of the different courts would suggest that the Court of Appeals would require a more lengthy period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.366" offset="2912150">Moreover, when a defendant files a pretrial motion such as the motions in this case, he must be taken to contemplate the amount of time that will be necessary to resolve the motion and to resolve an appeal should one be necessary, but suggests that in that context, the delay cannot be counted against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.766" offset="2989785">The defendant must be taken to have foreseen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.263" offset="3003787">And the problem is, you will be creating a litigable claim of error every time there is a pretrial appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.840" offset="3030014">I would note in this very case that the defendants represented that if this Court reverses, they will file another speedy trial motion on remand in the District Court seeking dismissal once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.366" offset="3072123">This appeal has not proceeded in an unduly slow fashion, yet this is the kind of claim, this is the kind of problem that is created by the Court of Appeals' balancing of the factors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.938" offset="3130429">I would note in particular that the federal courts have had relatively little experience with the speedy trial clause since the effective date of the Speedy Trial Act, and believe that inexperience is demonstrated in the Court of Appeals opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.353" offset="3196153">The court purported to exclude certain amounts of time to excuse it, to weigh it neutrally, to weigh it against no one, but in the end, it simply put all of the appeal time back into the balance, and the amount of time that is typically taken on appeals will, I think, inevitably skew the balance in this fashion toward a finding of a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.158" offset="3279327">The very least reasonable amounts of time on appeal must be excluded when the balance is undertaken under Barker versus Wingo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.923" offset="4366439">But that is simply not this case, and for the reasons that I suggested earlier, even where the speedy trial clause does apply, we do not believe that times such as this can normally lead to a speedy trial clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.761" offset="4429759">What I would suggest as the general rule for the Court is that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, more than just time, more than just delay, something more must be required to trigger the full balancing test under Barker versus Winco.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.350" offset="4812088">--Well, after the new indictment, there was a government appeal and a defense appeal, and that consumed time also, but the real result in this case is that we were ready for trial back in 1976, and the government was not, and that was the Act that gave all the resulting delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.999" offset="4882723">The issue for this Court today as I see it is whether the appellate court should be held immune from the speedy trial clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.792" offset="4917831">The Sixth Amendment provides that any person charged with a crime shall be given a trial without undue delay, and the government urges that this Court hold that appellate delay, no matter how long, no matter in what circumstance, is incapable as a matter of law from being undue or unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.348" offset="4984078">We believe such an unflexible standard is incompatible with the test announced by this Court in Barker-Wingo and is irreconcilable with the protections of the concerns underlying the speedy trial clause, that a speedy trial be provided to defendant because lack of such a speedy trial will harm him, his defense, and the courts, and society as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.760" offset="5081776">The government seems to suggest to this Court that the Barker test is incapable of accurately balancing the interests in a case of appellate delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.740" offset="5117616">We think that the appellate delay is not so different from any other type of delay that it cannot be adequately considered under the reasons for delay factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.802" offset="7937900">Additionally, I would like to point to the Court that the experience of the amicus in this case of a defender service is such that the government's reasons for wanting such an exclusion from the Sixth Amendment has no basis in fact There is no problem that needs to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.062" offset="8002997">The government engages in a rather prolific pretrial appeal practice in the D.C. courts, and they have not lost one case from unnecessary delay in the appellate process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.328" offset="9232006">So, to focus on the technicality of the dismissal really punishes these defendants for wanting a speedy trial was that desire for a speedy trial required the government to proceed and give them that speedy trial, and when they refused, the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.950" offset="9282474">In addition... well, basically, I would like to say at this point that I think that what we have here is a situation where their needs and message come from this Court to both the government and to the appellate courts to decide more expeditiously through the appellate courts, and if there is not sufficient machinery, which I don't know that to be the case, but if there is not sufficient machinery for them to make those expeditious rulings, and parenthetically it may be, because in 1976 and '77 and '78 the Ninth Circuit was understaffed by 13 judges, the Congress should give them that machinery so they can act expeditiously, but in any event, that they should go and recognize that the cases are pretrial, that people and the system suffers when there is no speedy trial given in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.647" offset="9477243">And secondly, I think there needs to be a clear message to government that it need not believe a defendant when he says that he wants a speedy trial, but when he says it and they have an opportunity to give it, and they are ordered to provide it, they had better provide it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.010" offset="10850762">In response to Justice White's question, it is quite clear why Congress excluded appeal time under the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.865" offset="10878138">We cite the legislative history at Page 20 in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.770" offset="10889736">Congress said it would indeed be anomalous to permit the defendant to benefit from delay properly undertaken to protect his interest in a fair adjudication of the charges against him by allowing dismissal without exclusion of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.265" offset="10947728">That is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.452" offset="10952535">The lynchpin of the defendant's argument here is that they said on May 12th, 1976, we are ready to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.481" offset="10984613">We are ready to stand or fall under Barker versus Wingo on this Court's analysis and interpretation of that request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.650" offset="11021289">The defendant sought to force us to go to trial without that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.774" offset="11033828">That is a trial that would have taken about two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.771" offset="11041769">A jury would have been empaneled, and judgment of acquittal would have been entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.982" offset="11126615">They made clear at Page 9 of their brief in Footnote 13, they say,</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.996" offset="11146677">"As in 1976, these indigent defendants did not want their resources taxed by the need to defend two separate trials. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.915" offset="11174367">They wanted us to go to trial, one trial, without that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.335" offset="11192025">Plainly that is something we could not have been in a position to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.692" offset="11205505">I think their hypocritical statements that they wanted to go to trial at that time plainly are unworthy of any weight under Barker versus Wingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.220" offset="11239568">I want to emphasize as well that regardless of how appeal time is treated under Barker, as far as the analysis of the four factors goes, cannot be plainer that these defendants... that the speedy trial clause was not violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.557" offset="11308950">When you examine the absence of requests for a speedy trial, absence of a true desire for a speedy trial, the absence of prejudice, any prejudice at this time is wholly speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.929" offset="11350432">They refer to the deaths of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.005" offset="11358687">They don't mention that these are government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.394" offset="11368300">I think that... and the reasons for the delay here, the need for the appellate court to have an en banc ruling determination of a very important issue involving the loss and destruction of evidence, I think you can't be clear that the balance comes out that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.670" offset="11437368">Your opponent argues that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has a rule that counts appellate time and that has not resulted in any losses of prosecution, and he also mentions the fact in the Ninth Circuit in the late seventies there was a shortage of judges, and they were way, way behind in their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.053" offset="11510928">To what extent do we have a problem of general significance, or is it just one case that is at stake?</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.191" offset="11531513">I think you are going to have a real problem with general significance, Justice Stevens, if you affirm the manner in which the Court of Appeals in this case undertook the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.842" offset="11570070">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals does not balance the factors in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.654" offset="11589296">This is the first case we have seen that has in our view wholly misread the balancing test, and I believe if you--</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.135" offset="11619284">Well, that goes to the question of whether they properly counted the time, but you are... you are sticking with your argument, though, that even the D.C. Court of Appeals rule was quit wrong?</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.210" offset="11655542">--We do believe it is incorrect, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.052" offset="11666932">I point out another important aspect of the defendant's argument seems to be that the Court of Appeals should as a general matter truly expedite, truly hurry through the pretrial appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.139" offset="11727222">And I point out that especially under the new Bail Act that defendants in post-conviction appeals are going to typically be under far greater prejudicial restraints than are defendants in pretrial appeals such as the ones in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.353" offset="11784065">And to totally neglect them simply to hurry through on the pretrial appeals I think would be a big mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.302" offset="11819905">I would also point out that out of the six years or so that this case was on appeal, one year of that time has to be attributed solely to the defendants, their completely frivolous rehearing and cert petitions after the second appeal, and indeed, their cert petitions after the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.405" offset="11880300">At that point, the case was in precisely the same posture it would have been in had the District Court denied their motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.966" offset="11906527">It was interlocutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.964" offset="11910602">Those are claims just like the speedy trial claim that is the subject here that can be preserved until after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.759" offset="11933694">They did not move on this last remand for a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.805" offset="11949890">They moved again for a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.633" offset="11957204">I also point out that the... on the first appeal, the Court of Appeals certainly did rule in favor of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.442" offset="11988447">It reversed the with prejudice aspect of the dismissal, which of course was the only thing that really mattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.609" offset="12021152">And finally, on the remand for an evidentiary hearing in the District Court, we would simply submit, as we explained in our reply brief, that being ordered to appear at a hearing like that is not the kind of restraint that we think would implicate the speedy trial clause of MacDonald.</text>
