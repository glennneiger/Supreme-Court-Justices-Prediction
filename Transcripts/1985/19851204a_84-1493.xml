            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="130036">Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="nopton_j_come" startTime="115.541" stopTime="414.353">
            <label>Mr. Nopton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="115.541" offset="592194">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="120.593" offset="612361">This case involves another kind of voting rights question, specifically whether the National Labor Relations Board reasonably exercised the broad discretion which it possesses to establish and administer the procedures and petitions for certifying a labor organization as the statutory bargaining representative, and concluding that all bargaining unit employees are not just union members must be afforded an opportunity to vote on the affiliation of their bargaining representative with an international union before, the Board will substitute the newly affiliated union for the old union as the unit employees' exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.821" offset="881318">The basic facts are these: the First Bank Independent Employees' Association FIEA, was certified by the Board in 1970 after winning a Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.564" offset="944220">It was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit consisting of all of the employees of the Seattle First National Bank in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.491" offset="995943">The FIEA negotiated successive collective bargaining agreements with the bank, the last expiring in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.879" offset="1037530">In 1977 the FIEA Executive Council decided to seek affiliation with the detail Clerks International Union and a union affiliation election was scheduled for February 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.908" offset="1105657">Prior to the election all bargaining unit employees were informed of the proposed affiliation and toll that only those who were union members as of January of '78 would be eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.770" offset="1169083">At the time of the affiliation vote about 2,600 of the 4,790 of the employees in the unit were FIEA members.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.331" offset="1247345">1,206 voted for the affiliation and 774 voted against.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.170" offset="1282663">The 2,176 non-members comprising over 45 percent of the unit were not permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.347" offset="1335326">The FIEA is chartered by the International Union as Financial Institution Employees of America Local 1182 which is the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.154" offset="1386630">The local filed a petition with the Board seeking amendment of the outstanding certification in favor of FIEA to reflect this affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.164" offset="1442637">The Board has a procedure, 102.60-V of its rules, that provides the Board may amend a certification in the absence of a question concerning representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.725" offset="1512854">The Board initially granted the amendment relying on its then current view that affiliation of an independent union with an international was essentially an internal union matter in which non-members were not entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.241" offset="1610970">The Board subsequently, in a case called Amoco Four, reversed its earlier position and concluded that affiliation because of its impact on the right of all bargaining unit employees to choose their representatives is not a purely internal union affair and therefore that an affiliation election, if it is to serve as a basis or Board amendment of the certification, must be open to all union members.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="414.353" offset="1787349">Another three to two decision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nopton_j_come" startTime="415.670" stopTime="717.818">
            <label>Mr. Nopton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="415.670" offset="1792678">Yes, it was another three to two decision, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.340" offset="1811381">The Board's... I might say that this is an issue that has divided the Board for over 20 years, and the Board has changed its mind on this issue within that period several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.526" offset="1936038">It is now of the view that the view expressed in Amoco Four, which has been sustained by the Fifth Circuit, better effectuates and is more consonant with the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.974" offset="2029869">Pursuant to its decision in Amoco Four, the Board which had originally amended the certification in this case, reversed their decision and dismissed the petition to amend the certification and the unfair labor practice complaint that it issued based thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.481" offset="2167900">On review to the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit set aside the Board's determination, and that's why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.574" offset="2220250">To put the problem in perspective with a little bit of a background, Section 9-C-1 of the Act requires the Board to direct an election by secret ballot and to certify the results thereof whenever it finds that a question of representative has been raised, as to whether the employees desire to select a union as their bargaining representative or to cut or replace a previously designated representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.414" offset="2371656">All unit employees have the right to participate in a Board conducted election.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.936" offset="2397778">Well established rules and procedures ensure that employees will have an opportunity to make a free choice after hearing the views of all interested parties, including the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.696" offset="2456815">The union that is certified becomes the bargaining representative for all unit members, and is under a duty to represent them fairly whether they are members of the union or not members of the union, as this Court has often recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.947" offset="2569768">Now, after a union has been certified, it often undergoes organizational changes ranging from a mere name change to things that are more substantial such as affiliation with an international union which is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.664" offset="2676661">The industrial stability, in the Board's view, which the Act seeks to promote, would be unnecessarily disturbed if every union organizational adjustment were to warrant a redetermination of the bargaining representative through a Board conducted election.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.630" offset="2764537">Accordingly, the Board has established a procedure, which I have referred to earlier, whereby it will permit a union that has affiliated or undergone some other similar organic change to step into the shoes of the old union without a Board election, provided that certain requirements are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.053" offset="2914167">First, the Board requires that there be reliable evidence that the change reflects the wishes of the affected employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.366" offset="2987414">And what the Board--</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="1741.234" offset="7094908">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.673" offset="7128658">I think it would be helpful at the outset to note two aspects of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.248" offset="7170976">First of all, the Board's present rule applies only where there is a change in the organizational structure of a certified bargaining representative that in the Board's judgment is not sufficient to destroy the continuity of the selected representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.144" offset="7258539">This is not a situation in which the Board has determined that organization "A" no longer exists and that organization "B" has come into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.671" offset="7320710">Rather, the Board's premise and the very reason it has determined that its representation procedures as stated in Section 9 of the Act are not applicable is that there is one organization and only one organization, an organization which has stood the test of a representation election and which continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.256" offset="7431052">Secondly, this is not a situation in which the union's interest is to secure from the Board some official recognition of its affiliation of its name change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.468" offset="7503881">This is a situation in which the issue is whether or not the employer as the Act states is to be required to continue to recognize a continuing organization which has been selected by the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.517" offset="7600012">The scheme of the Act is not one which provides for regular and periodic tests of employee sentiment whenever the employer wishes to have that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.984" offset="7701889">Rather, the system is that where a union claims to be the representative of a group of presently unrepresented employees, the union can seek a Board election or the employer, if the union asks the employer to recognize the organization, can seek a Board election and the Board, using public resources, thereupon conducts an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.710" offset="7864789">That election's effects continue in force unless one of two circumstances obtains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.167" offset="7906689">The first circumstance is that a group of the represented employees go to the Labor Board as they have a right to do under Section 9-C-1-A and say, we do not wish to be represented by this organization, and if certain requisites, a sufficient number of employees, less than the majority, I would add, make such a request then the Board will hold what is called a decertification election and the employees at that point can of their own initiative and volition reject the continuing effects of this first publicly held Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.033" offset="8110131">Or, secondly, the Board has held that where an employer has objective evidence that a majority no longer support the organization that was selected, the employer can precipitate a test of either... of the correctness of its view or another election by refusing to bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.333" offset="8747309">Proposition No. 1 is that there is one organization which continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.903" offset="8781582">Proposition No. 2 is that an affiliation decision concerns the selection of a new representative and that the Board either on a prophylactic basis or some other basis they want to make up can therefore regulate that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.703" offset="9084812">I had started to argue why I thought it was inconsistent with the Act but Justice Rehnquist very fairly asked whether I was arguing that the decision is irrational without getting into any of the larger questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.027" offset="9142072">We do argue, and we emphasize that in our judgment this decision is irrational in this basic sense, that its premises are mutually inconsistent, and therefore at the very least the matter has to go back to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.459" offset="9227858">I would like to in that respect attempt to elaborate a bit on the questions that Justice O'Connor raised because the Board, while saying that there is one organization here which has continuity, has based its right to regulate on two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.811" offset="9349275">The first is that even though there's one entity and it has been selected and it continues, affiliation decisions involve, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.453" offset="9391803">"the selection of a bargaining representative. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.536" offset="9400162">of a new bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.071" offset="9406222">That, as I attempted to say to Justice Rehnquist, seems to as to be totally irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.177" offset="9442689">You can't say those two things at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.895" offset="9461602">Secondly, the Board says, but even if this isn't a question concerning the selection of a new bargaining representative or a different bargaining representative, it is a decision that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.756" offset="9525027">"significantly affects the union's representation of the bargaining unit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.494" offset="9547910">That in our judgment is not open to attack on the ground that it is inconsistent with the Board's major premise, namely that there is continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.802" offset="9601200">But it's inconsistent with the background I was attempting to spell out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.706" offset="9624815">The National Labor Relation Board is an extremely important agency which as a central role of labor-management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.077" offset="9662327">But Congress in its wisdom has not given the Labor Board the authority to regulate everything having to do with labor-management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.119" offset="9702451">Rather, Congress has made the judgment, and we spell this out in detail in part 2 of our brief, and this Court has grappled with this issue a number of times, that once the representative is selected, the members will control the organization and that you have to be a member to have the rights within the organization to control its destiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.571" offset="9828256">The union cannot force you, as this Court said last term, even once you've joined, to stay in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.658" offset="9860648">The union cannot do anything once it is selected as the representative to imperil your job rights or to otherwise interfere with your rights as an employee, but the individual who chooses not to join and be an active member does not have a voice in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.607" offset="9956361">That being so, and given the nature of organizations, the proposition that the Labor Board can give non-members a voice on any union decision that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.485" offset="10027936">"significantly effects the union's representation of the bargaining unit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.620" offset="10048416">destroys the logic of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.274" offset="10067120">The union is going to be faced with one decision after another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.344" offset="10095332">Who will be the officers?</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.696" offset="10100766">You might have had someone in as an officer in the first term of the union's existence who believed that the best way to approach the employer was to get along with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.623" offset="10160429">That individual may run for union office and be defeated by someone else who takes a completely different view of how the union ought to approach the employer, far more militantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.030" offset="10214137">Certainly that is a decision that significantly affects the union's representation of the bargaining unit, or I could use any of the other examples that have already been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.357" offset="10263456">The union changes its constitution to permit the Executive Board to call a strike rather than have a membership vote, or the other way around, or the union determines to organize a new bargaining unit which will change the balance of power within the union with regard to all the further internal decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.370" offset="13859473">The inconsistency that Mr. Gold has posed is illusory in the sense that as I pointed out earlier, the Board has not made a continuity determination in this case yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.591" offset="13996354">It says that under its position, it will not reach that lengthy determination unless there is first some evidence that the affected employees want the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.569" offset="14076289">The question is whether the Board has authority and is reasonable in imposing that threshold requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.193" offset="14114741">We submit that it can do so under the statute as an incident of its general authority to police its certifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.751" offset="14168972">As the cases pointed out in footnote 11 of the Board's brief on page 17 show, there are a variety of other situations in which the Board, even though it is not specifically spelled out in the statute but as an incident of administering Section 9-A and B of the statute, will conduct elections and inquiries to determine whether or not its certification should be revoked or amended or modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.963" offset="14345873">It may do so to clarify the scope of a bargaining unit, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.517" offset="14372100">It may do so as in the Hughes Tool case, to revoke a certification where it finds that the union has been guilty of practicing racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.943" offset="14421732">Here, similarly, it is the Board, we submit, has the discretion and the power to determine the circumstances under which it is going to amend the certification and change the designation of the certified bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.796" offset="14549210">The union that was certified here was an independent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.784" offset="14569167">The employees at this installation had only recently in a Board election voted against affiliation with an international union before the independent was certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.328" offset="14643251">The union then comes back and asks for the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.017" offset="14670000">We submit that the Board was reasonable in imposing this threshold, democratic requirement for amending the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.706" offset="14712841">Thank you.</text>
