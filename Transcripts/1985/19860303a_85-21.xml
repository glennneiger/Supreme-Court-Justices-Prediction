            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139978">We will hear arguments first this morning in Square D Company against Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.934" offset="175714">Mr. Rigler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas V. Rigler</label>
            <text syncTime="15.870" offset="203403">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented in this proceeding is whether motor carriers who conspire in violation of the antitrust laws, who violate their filed rate bureau agreement, and who violate provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act are immune from damage suits brought under the antitrust laws by the victims of their illegal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.749" offset="310923">The petitioners here today are two shippers who brought suit in a class representative capacity with respect to the transport of commodities by motor freight between points in the eastern and central United States and the province of Ontario, Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.492" offset="377901">The respondents are the Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, a regulated rate bureau, and five member trucking company carriers of that bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.519" offset="413950">The action closely parallels the United States Government action not brought under the antitrust laws which was settled by consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.484" offset="449895">At the District Court level the defendant's carriers moved to dismiss the case, and the District Court granted that motion, holding that maintenance of an action for damages under the antitrust laws was barred by application of this Court's 1922 decision in Keogh versus Chicago and Northwest Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.039" offset="536099">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reluctantly upheld the District Court, holding that the task of overruling Keogh if it is to be overruled is for this Court, but the Second Circuit expressed substantial doubt that any of the basic rationale which necessitated the Court's Keogh ruling in 1922 is valid today.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.806" offset="663158">Keogh should be overruled because the passage of the Reed-Bullwinkle Act and subsequent decisions of this Court have rendered it inapplicable under the clear repugnancy doctrine which necessitated it in the original instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.436" offset="769634">We still have an action pending for injunction, and the Second Circuit did give leave to amend in the event there were claims outside of the Keogh doctrine, but basically the answer is, yes, we do, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.808" offset="811116">The allegations of the complaint are to be accepted as correct for purposes of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.788" offset="843090">Those allegations are that notwithstanding the fact that they had a Bureau agreement on file at the ICC which would have given these carriers antitrust exemption, they organized a secret committee of principles or top management executives, and that these principles met to fix prices, to engage in anticompetitive acts, and to coerce other carriers into withdrawing or withholding independent rate filings which were lower and would have had the effect of lowering the overall tariff structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.759" offset="978927">Now, the act of coercing other carriers into withholding or withdrawing their independent rate filings is explicitly and specifically forbidden by the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.003" offset="1031903">Thus the conduct at issue here violates the antitrust laws and the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.431" offset="1145692">In other words, they prevented rates from being filed, and yes, we would be asserting an antitrust clause of action based on the coercion which precluded other carriers from exercising their statutory right to file lower rates.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas V. Rigler</label>
            <text syncTime="339.301" offset="1497091">Well, what they ignored was the method of fixing rates which was approved by the Commission, and that is what they had statutory authority to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.937" offset="1543694">The evil is that instead of following an exemption given to them by Congress in express antitrust immunity, instead, they chose to go around that and to subvert the regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.774" offset="1607015">Now, when they did that and filed rates in which shippers were denied participation, and in which shippers didn't realize that there were other carriers out there willing to offer even lower rates, that constituted a violation which is actionable under the antitrust laws, and it is no longer safeguarded by the express immunity which Congress granted in Reed-Bullwinkle.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.169" offset="1704608">Neither is there any necessity for the implied immunity which the Court granted so long ago in Keogh, because now the basic tension between the Interstate Commerce Act, which in 1922 permitted the ICC to approve jointly proposed rates and the prohibition in the Sherman Act which said companies should not get together and fix rates and fix prices, that basic original tension was resolved in 1948 when Congress eliminated the dilemma, and this Court repeatedly has held that only a clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and a regulatory statute will permit even implied immunity, and that implied immunity is to be narrowly construed so as to make the regulatory plan work.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.241" offset="1924873">Once the carriers had an opportunity to do that and went outside, then their rates should be subject to the ordinary application of the antitrust laws, and notwithstanding that they were filed with the Commission, and notwithstanding that they became effective &lt;thirty&gt; [= 30] days after approval, without any action by the Commission because the Commission simply no longer has the resources to review these... but even assuming that they had done it, it wouldn't have been a fair review.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.758" offset="2054962">In their briefs, the respondents contend that when we paid the filed rates with the ICC, we got to use their words, exactly what we were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.287" offset="2097072">Well, we didn't get what we were entitled to because the ratemaking process didn't work the way it was supposed to because these very respondents subverted it.</text>

I think this is an important point... when Congress passed the Reed-Bullwinkle Act, it alluded to the Shipping Act of 1966 as a model, as a precedent for the type of express immunity it was granted, so that if the carrier... if the carriers must pay or stand vulnerable to antitrust damages or illegal activities or unauthorized activities under the Maritime Act, presumptively the same would apply in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.965" offset="3723769">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the complaints in this case were dismissed to seek recovery for damages under the Sherman Act, alleging that the respondents had engaged in conduct that was not approved and could not be approved by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.049" offset="3816138">The charged concerted price fixing activity is outside the scope of collaboration that is authorized and immunized from the antitrust laws by the Reed-Bullwinkle Act, and it is well established that the conduct charged is subject to the proscriptions of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.039" offset="3928047">That has been true since the trans-Missouri and Joint Traffic Association cases, and was recognized again in Georgia against Pennsylvania Railroad, and indeed, the government brought a suit to enjoin much of the conduct that is at issue in these complaints, and a consent decree was entered against that conduct, so the question in the case is not whether the alleged conduct is immunized from the antitrust laws, it is whether there is adequate reason for a more limited implied immunity only from damage suits by shippers injured by the alleged violation of the anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.020" offset="4112053">In other words, whether there is adequate reason why carriers who have violated both the Interstate Commerce Act and the Sherman Act must be allowed to retain the fruits of their violation, and the Sherman Act violation is a crime, I will remind the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.965" offset="4183838">They must be allowed to retain those fruits as against injured persons who are within the class that Congress sought to protect in both of those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.780" offset="4319047">And if there is an overcharge as against the charge that the tariff authorizes, an order can be entered to give reparations for the overcharge, and that would be enforceable in Court, and there is a court action for reparations against unreasonable rates under the Act in a statute that Congress passed to overrule this Court's decision in T.I.M.E., but if the tariff has not been violated and the rate charged is within the zone of reasonableness, the ICC does not have a remedy to recompense shippers, even... it can revoke the tariff, but even though the shippers might be able to prove that had the antitrust violation not occurred a lower rate within the zone of reasonableness would have been available to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.772" offset="4879008">Or one could say we are asking that that aspect of the Georgia case be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.551" offset="4902100">The Georgia case did not reexamine that rationale, but applied it in the scope that it was stated by the Court in Keogh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.562" offset="4946195">Now, we have detailed in our brief, as Judge Friendly did for the Court of Appeals, the reason why the rationale of Keogh has become obsolete in its particulars, and I won't repeat that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.338" offset="5009307">The main point is that the rule of Keogh is incompatible with this Court's modern jurisprudence strongly disfavoring implied antitrust immunities, limiting them to plain repugnancy between the two schemes and authorizing them not only to the minimum extent necessary to make the other federal statutory scheme work, and our position is here not only is the immunity unnecessary, but compliance with the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by Reed-Bullwinkle would be fostered by the availability of an antitrust damage remedy as a deterrent to violations of the procedure specified by Reed-Bullwinkle for collaboration that includes shipper participation in the Rate Bureau activities and a lack of coercion of members of the Rate Bureau from filing independent rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.215" offset="5292788">Nor is there any inconsistency between the established presumption against implied antitrust immunity and what has come to be known as the filed rate doctrine, which prevents use of the courts to bypass agency authority under the statutes that agencies are charged to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.550" offset="5386097">The claim here is not a claim under the Interstate Commerce Act, and the ICC does not administer the Sherman Act, nor is this a case like ARCLA, the Court's most recent filed rate case, in which someone was trying to circumvent a tariff that he himself had filed, and if there is anything that this Court's Carnation decision stands for, it is that the ordinary rule against implied antitrust immunities is compatible with the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.927" offset="5527681">So, are submission is that there is no need to allow persons to retain the benefits of their antitrust violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.674" offset="6638616">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this Court has never allowed plaintiffs to end run the Interstate Commerce Act by taking their rate complaints to the courts instead of to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.091" offset="6688249">The court has always read the Interstate Commerce Act to mean that a shipper who thinks he is paid too much money must take that complaint to the expert agency, and antitrust cases have been no exception to the rule, and you can easily see why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.709" offset="6758780">If a plaintiff could easily have chosen to go after treble damages and attorneys' fees and to argue technical rate issues to a lay jury instead of to the expert agency that Congress created to regulate rates, there would have been little incentive to go to the Commission, but Congress wanted the Interstate Commerce Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission, not the antitrust laws and not the courts to regulate and govern the legality of rates, and if shippers could have gone to courts, that Congressional policy would have been defeated, and that is why Keogh was decided the way it was, and that is why it should be reaffirmed and not only ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.455" offset="6949787">Now, we have three specific reasons which I can briefly summarize why the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.556" offset="7046127">If the Court's interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act and Keogh in Georgia was wrong, and no one here contends that it was wrong, Congress has had those cases in front of it for over 60 years, and is in a position to correct the law, and this has been an area of intense Congressional activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.098" offset="7240269">--That is the government's argument, but I think that is insufficient except as a policy rationale addressed to the Congress to justify overturning 60 years of established precedent, and we think, Your Honor, that this case simply can't be distinguished from Keogh and Georgia, as hard as petitioners have tried, Number One.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.432" offset="7341624">Number Two, Congress has never overruled this Court's interpretation in those cases, and Number Three, the policy arguments that the government makes about competition being the order of the day and such ought to be addressed to Congress, which has the issue before it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.986" offset="7419887">I would like to take those points in order, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.406" offset="7433575">Very briefly, it is flatly incorrect to say that the rates at issue in Keogh and Georgia were the product or were made in compliance with the regulatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.823" offset="7495224">Those rates were the result of per se illegal naked price fixing conspiracy and collusion that was not approved by the Commission, that was beyond the power of the Commission to approve and immunize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.955" offset="7563769">The complaint in the Georgia case called those willful violations, said they flouted ICC procedures, they were outside of the express immunity contained in certificate 44, which was the wartime immunity, and the Court recognized that government prosecutions would be adequate to deal with those kinds of illegal forms of agreements because it would not interfere with the heart of the Commission's discretion over rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.208" offset="7696785">But treble damages would have the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.128" offset="7708487">Treble damages as administered by the courts would involve the courts in a forbidden pursuit, namely deciding what rates other than the file rate would be lawful, and that was a decision that Congress wanted the Commission to make, and set up specific statutory standards and procedures and remedies that were just plain different from the standards and remedies and procedures under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.332" offset="7853206">So, it is wrong to say that our position is not based on the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.126" offset="7884448">The statute defines specifically what rate it is that a shipper is entitled to, and it is a just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.981" offset="7939828">It is not the competitive just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.041" offset="7964069">It is not the lowest reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.351" offset="7981310">It is just what it says, and there is no necessary relationship between a violation of a Rate Bureau procedure and whether that rate is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.860" offset="8039407">That is an issue for the Commission to decide, and in fact in the Wheat Rail case the Commission found that even though there was a Rate Bureau violation, there had not been injury caused to the shipper, and the Commission refused to retroactively nullify or abrogate that rate, and that decision by the Commission was cited with approval by this Court in the ATA decision when it upheld a new administrative remedy for shippers to redress Rate Bureau violations and to receive what this Court thought was potentially ruinous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.971" offset="8647851">Congress said there is a two-year period within which you can consider it, whether rates are lawful or unlawful under the standards of the Act, which is the point of the referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.920" offset="8691632">This case involves 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.405" offset="8701558">There are other cases out there, Justice O'Connor, that involve 25 or 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.276" offset="8729039">So I think we are talking about a procedure which would be such a mess for the courts and would leave so many unanswered questions in terms of where our appeal rights were, were they from the Commission decision, was the Commission's decision advisory, do we submit it to the jury, do we argue contrary facts to the jury, do we appeal from the jury verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.203" offset="8836768">None of those questions have been addressed by this Court, and certainly they have not been addressed by the Congress, and we think that in a statute which is supposed to provide certain continuity, and where Congress has clearly laid out a map or a guidepost for remedies, and where this Court has refused to authorize this kind of a detailed referral procedure on rates, this would be a bad case to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.106" offset="10560327">In the Wheat Rail case, they considered under a different statute whether or not a Rate Bureau violation which the plaintiffs contended resulted in an unlawful rate justified retroactively nullifying the tariff, and they concluded that in the circumstances of that case, there was no injury, and it was not justified, and therefore the rate should be only cancelled prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.969" offset="10687805">So, the Commission has wide discretion, and I think the point to be made, Justice White and Justice Stevens, is that the Commission created a set of unique rights in shippers that the antitrust laws just don't give to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.788" offset="10783100">They give shippers the right to know what rate is in effect at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.066" offset="10808177">They give them a 30-day lead time before it goes into effect, and the point is that what is fair or not fair as decided by Congress and this Court in the T.I.M.E. case concluded that it wasn't going to substitute its judgment for Congress's on the delicate balance of shipper interests and carrier interests, and recognize that even though in that case the shipper, which happened to be the United States, might be without a remedy, that the fact that it was without a remedy was a deliberate choice by Congress, and it would therefore not be a justification for substituting a court action which would only interfere with the Commission's jurisdiction, and so we don't think you can distinguish your way out from under Keogh and Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.387" offset="11025516">We think that the facts of those cases and their rationale clearly apply here, and the proposition that is presented is that the Reed-Bullwinkle Act overruled those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.304" offset="11073163">Here we say that the enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission, which after all is bound to interpret and imply that statute, have said in their briefs that Reed-Bullwinkle did not overrule Keogh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.733" offset="11150904">The lower courts that have looked at this issue agree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.762" offset="11179011">And we think that the legislative history, as Judge Friendly analyzed it, shows that Congress did not intend to overrule Keogh, but rather to augment it, but the problem is government prosecution and the lack of agency authority to regulate rate bureaus, and it was not Keogh, because Keogh after all was intended to protect the rate authority of the Commission and those special powers as the process by which rates got set, and there was no reason therefore for Congress to want to overrule a statutory interpretation that only served to carry out its intent, and there is a remarkably clear statement in the legislative history, I think, which underscores that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.367" offset="11377438">The Congress says, look, we understand that the antitrust laws are not necessary to regulate rates, and the reason they are not necessary to regulate rates is that we have cloaked a government authority, with the power to decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.951" offset="11467717">And so the antitrust laws don't apply in that area, and we think that is a particularly powerful statement in light of the history that... the history that Judge Friendly reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.428" offset="11541591">Now, they don't make the petitioners any more of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, and the reason they don't make anything of that Act is that that Act is forward looking, and their case seeks to reach back over a 16-year period and apply treble damages and attorneys' fees with respect to rates that are ancient history, that were made and carried out under the old rule that I should say were always subject to and contained in filed tariffs that were required to be paid and were the exclusive means by which carrier and shipper relationships were carried out in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.643" offset="11730509">And they don't rely on the Motor Carrier Act for a second reason, and that is that Congress made a deliberate decision in that Act to retain the full ratemaking powers of the Commission which this Court interpreted in Keogh and Georgia as requiring shippers to use those powers and not the antitrust laws to resolve disputes over rates.</text>
