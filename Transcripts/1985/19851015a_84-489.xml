            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146650">We will hear arguments first this morning in Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction against the United States Marshals Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.638" offset="185102">Mr. Zimmerman, you may proceed whenever you are ready Mr. Attorney General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leroy_s_zimmerman" startTime="17.635" stopTime="206.566">
            <label>Mr. Leroy S. Zimmerman</label>
            <text syncTime="17.635" offset="217181">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.991" offset="230555">The question presented by this appeal is whether a district court has the authority to direct the United States Marshals Service to share responsibility with state officials for the production of state inmates to appear in Federal District Court at a trial of a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.906" offset="306206">This question arose in the course of a civil rights action brought by a state prisoner against Philadelphia County officials for events allegedly occurring while he was in the custody of county prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.620" offset="361063">The magistrate ordered the state custodians to produce the plaintiff and two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.587" offset="384991">Plaintiff was incarcerated 220 miles from the federal courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.945" offset="402337">One witness 218 miles away and another witness 143 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.349" offset="423966">Recognizing the burden that is placed on the state custodians, the magistrate ordered that state custodians transport the inmates to the Philadelphia House of Detention, there to transfer custody to the United States Marshals, who would transport the prisoners from the House of Detention to the Federal Courthouse and maintain custody of them while they were inside the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.354" offset="532008">Well, the magistrate's order transferring custody from state to federal officers and the apportion of transportation responsibilities were based in part on his knowledge that the U.S. Marshal regularly transported federal prisoners between the Philadelphia House of Detention and the Federal Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.988" offset="610585">This arrangement permitted state custodians to avoid the deployment of guards from their primary responsibility, that of maintaining prison security, to transferring prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.390" offset="660113">The U.S. Marshals Service intervened to oppose the orders, arguing that no authority exists to support such orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.341" offset="691982">In rejecting the Marshals' contentions, the magistrate recognized that the explosion of federal civil rights litigation by state prisoners has strained available resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.931" offset="742346">Consequently, in fashioning a procedure, the magistrate stressed that his order placed considerable burden on state officials, but the Marshal really would have very little burden, if any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.630" offset="797099">The Court of Appeals in a split decision did not dispute the magistrate's factual and pragmatic conclusions, rather, Judge Gibbons, writing for the Court, concluded that no statutory authority, including the All Writs Act, supported the magistrate's order, apportioning the transportation responsibility between state officials and the United States Marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.372" offset="888110">The Court held that the Marshal is obligated to maintain custody over the prisoners while they are in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.229" offset="919561">In fact, the Court of Appeals held that if security concerns justify it, the Marshal could be ordered to take custody of state prisoners outside the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.756" offset="961670">Now, it is our position--</text>

            <text syncTime="557.359" offset="2376044">In civil rights cases, it is necessary frequently for the Court to make a determination on whether or not to produce the prisoner or witness in the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.431" offset="2628283">As I said a moment again, a new writ only satisfy two requirements, that it be necessary or appropriate in aid of the court's jurisdiction, and agreeable to the usages and the principles of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.816" offset="4401892">In this case minimally I concede, but we are not focusing on that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.469" offset="4420492">I believe that the principle in this case is whether or not the magistrate... the problem in this case is whether the magistrate had the authority to do what he did and I believe the All Writs Act, of course, gives him that authority because of the need, to vary writs, to vary orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.105" offset="4479006">The question of burden in producing persons makes... That has to be examined and wherever it makes it more likely that the Court will be able to hear and to consider all of the evidence relevant to the merits of a claim, clearly that aids the Court in an informed exercise of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.191" offset="4551313">Now, the Marshals argue that these orders are neither appropriate or necessary because there already exists the general habeas corpus statute which they say places the full burden on the custodian to produce the prisoners in the Federal Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.747" offset="4613589">This argument, we believe, ignores the point that some cases may call for modification of traditional procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.556" offset="4644831">And, where modification is determined to be necessary or appropriate in aid of the Court's jurisdiction, the power to modify is found not in the habeas corpus statute, but in the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.019" offset="4694673">Thus, the habeas corpus statute is really not the end for purposes of analysis as the Marshals argue, but really the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.595" offset="4728946">Similar considerations, I submit, support the conclusion that the order under review is as required by the All Writs Act agreeable to the usages and principles of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.325" offset="4783907">Certainly, transfer of custody violates no positive congressional command nor does it violate any common law rule, rather the order modifies traditional procedure to respond to modern developments in our ever-expanding jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.552" offset="4856841">The essential principal underlying the writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum is affording the Court an orderly and an efficient means of procedure for securing the testimony of prisoner witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.233" offset="4915564">This principle hardly is subverted by a modification of the writ directing the transfer of a prisoner from the custodian to a substitute custodian.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="1455.299" offset="5967777">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.704" offset="5985435">The state's argument here is, in essence, that the magistrate's order is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.765" offset="6005706">The trial courts have broad authority to impose reasonable obligations on the United States Marshals Service and that our objection to the order are, as in the words of the state's reply brief, merely dry formalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.353" offset="6051995">All of that is far from correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.961" offset="6062444">The United States Marshals Service is an arm of the Executive Branch of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.616" offset="6081043">Marshals are appointed by the President, is part of the Department of Justice, and under the supervision of the Attorney General, and is funded through Department of Justice appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.753" offset="6121586">In fact, this Court in its opinion in the Naggle case reported in 135 U.S., specifically recognized that the Marshals Service is within the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.625" offset="6161083">Thus, contrary to the premise of the state's argument, the Marshals Service is not the hand-maiden or the administrative staff of the courts subject to whatever duties judges, in their discretion, may devise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.478" offset="6204550">Now, of course, the Marshals Service and the courts have developed a sound and cooperative working relation that well serves the effective administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.147" offset="6239137">The Marshal is by law subject to the control of federal judges in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.207" offset="6259408">In addition, the Marshal often exercises his discretion as an executive official and agrees to do things that legally could not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.767" offset="6293680">Thus, disputes of the kind involved in this case are fortunately very rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.031" offset="6314683">But, that cooperative arrangement does not negate the principle that there must be a source of statutory authorization before a court can require the Marshal, as part of the Executive Branch of the federal government, to take a particular action and expend its funds in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.945" offset="6382392">The Marshal has myriad responsibilities and only limited resources with which to carry them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.381" offset="6408097">Among its principal responsibilities are the security of the courthouse, custody over and transportation of federal prisoners needed in federal court, execution of arrest warrants, and seizure of forfeited property, and implementation of the Witness Protection Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.952" offset="6474448">To perform these duties, there are fewer than 1,000 Deputy Marshals nationwide, while there are 500 active federal district judges and 250 full-time magistrates in 500 federal court facilities around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.945" offset="6538395">The allocation among those various duties of the finite resources appropriated to the Marshal is at the heart of the Executive Branch's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.067" offset="6574862">In the aggregate, orders of the type entered by the magistrate here will impose a substantial burden on the Marshals Service and interfere with its discharge of its statutorily assigned responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.232" offset="6639541">In addition, a trial court in any given case, is in no position to assess these considerations and decide how the Marshals' resources are to be deployed overall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.950" offset="8514402">Now, absent legislative authorization, our submission is that a court cannot require the Marshal to transport state prisoners regardless of its view of the reasonableness of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.381" offset="8572080">The question then is whether there is any lawful authority for the transportation order issued in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.862" offset="8614085">Now, our analysis starts from the proposition, which is essentially undisputed, that under settled principles, it is the obligation of the custodian to produce its prisoners in court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.826" offset="8669883">Indeed, if the prisoners in this case were in federal rather than state custody, it would be the responsibility of the Marshal to transport them to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.262" offset="8827662">Now, the custodian's obligation to produce its prisoners existed at common law and is carried forward by the express terms of the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.178" offset="8875310">In fact, the whole theory of the ad testificandum writ requires that the custodian be the respondent and bring its prisoners to court since it is the custodian that has the control over the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.173" offset="8923270">It is the fact that custody that fixes the custodian mandatory and non-delegable legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.781" offset="8949706">This obligation reflects two important considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.592" offset="8964962">First, the custodian, like everyone else, has a public duty to make available evidence in its possession, here, the prisoner himself, even if that imposes a burden or is inconvenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.058" offset="9010833">And, second, the custodial state has a penal interest in the continued confinement of the prisoner, since it is that confinement that gives rise to the special problems and added expense of obtaining the prisoner in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.710" offset="9061406">It is not unfair or unreasonable for the law to impose the production obligation on the custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.426" offset="9084289">Since time immemorial until the recent state of litigation, the entire system has operated on the questioned rule that the production obligation rests on the custodian.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.465" offset="12092446">But, Section 569(b) is not an independent, affirmative source of judicial authority to address orders to the Marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.556" offset="12128808">Rather, it simply requires that the Marshal execute those orders that under some other source of lawful authority are properly directed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.960" offset="12162454">To give a specific illustration, the case at hand, the fact that a trial court is empowered to issue an ad testificandum writ to someone, that is the custodian, does not mean that it can issue the writ to the Marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.079" offset="12218879">A contrary conclusion would mean that the Marshal can be required to perform any order whose substantive terms are not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.669" offset="12253256">Under this theory, any court... any order that a court can enter at all could be directed against the Marshal in the first instance, but simply by the fact that it is addressed to him the Marshal would be bound to carry it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.888" offset="12702144">We proposed that in our brief and our position in this case, but the court stay its hand to allow the legislative process to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.119" offset="12735058">The Court granted certiorari in this case and it is very difficult to get legislation proposed or considered when the very issue is pending in a case before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.659" offset="12817187">It is a matter for Congress to decide in the end as a policy question, how the Marshals' resources should be spent, whether the Marshal, to transport state prisoners, in addition to or instead of its currently prescribed duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.075" offset="12870895">But, absent legislative authorization of that kind, there is simply no legal authority for the trial court to require the Marshal as an arm of the Executive Branch, to transport state prisoners to Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.428" offset="13088338">Certainly there are finite resources on both sides, the state and the Marshals Service in this particular case, and there will always be burden to be considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.503" offset="13124596">But, it is our position that the magistrate should have the discretion to consider the burden in order to try in more cases to have more prisoners, more witnesses in the court in these civil rights cases in order to make a more enlightened determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.761" offset="13189693">And, frequently, in the calculus that is used by the court to determine whether to issue the writ, that is a factor.</text>
