          <turn speaker="j_lloyd_snook_iii" startTime="25.157" stopTime="345.057">
            <label>Mr. J. Lloyd Snook, III</label>
            <text syncTime="25.157" offset="263552">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case, Smith versus Murray, presents three issues that I would like to discuss briefly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.893" offset="298451">The first is the issue of the Zant versus Stephens question on which the Fourth Circuit based its holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.946" offset="318618">The second is the underlying merits issue of whether the prosecution can call a psychiatrist who has been appointed to assist the defense to prove its aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.082" offset="355189">And third is whether the consideration of this issue is barred by the failure to appeal this issue after it had been raised at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.739" offset="385805">Now, turning very briefly to the first question, the Zant versus Stephens question, this Court, of course, in Zant versus Stephens specifically reserved the question presented here, and we contend that the Fourth Circuit quoted this Court's decision in Zant versus Stephens out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.368" offset="452365">Every statement of the issue as it was presented by this Court and as it was discussed by this Court specifically talked about the fact that the evidence that was being admitted was in fact admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.916" offset="498549">In fact, the Court endorsed the restriction that a different result might be reached in a case where evidence was submitted in support of the statutory aggravating circumstance which was not otherwise admissible and therefore the circumstance failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.274" offset="547973">So, Zant does not control this case and it should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.406" offset="564482">I would note that Zant was basically an Eighth Amendment case where the real question that this Court was confronting was whether to in essence federalize every state law violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.085" offset="611189">If there was a violation of state law, evidence inadmissible for some reason, for state law reasons, whether that became converted into an Eighth Amendment kind of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.251" offset="651836">The Court basically said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.832" offset="662180">We, of course, have a different situation here, where our claim is a Fifth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.616" offset="677331">There has never been any suggestion by this Court or any other Court that we are aware of that says that Zant versus Stephens takes Chapman versus California and the harmless error analysis away from capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.843" offset="734278">There is not a case out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.406" offset="740548">The basic problem is, this is a fifth amendment case, not an Eighth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.750" offset="757893">Now, on the merits of the issue, I think in order to understand the dilemma that counsel in a capital case in Virginia would find him or herself, you have to picture yourself as that defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.096" offset="803241">You have just been appointed in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.437" offset="812646">Virginia law allows the prosecution to prove aggravation, to prove future dangerousness with prior criminal record, with psychiatric evidence, including after Barefoot versus Estelle even hypothetical questions based on instances where there has not even been an examination, and in fact can prove future dangerousness simply from the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.320" offset="900208">If there are enough stab wounds, the Court... the jury may infer from that something relating to future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.745" offset="925808">The problem is, under state law, therefore, you have no notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.209" offset="943676">The prosecution is not required to give you notice of what they intend to introduce in aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.843" offset="974291">You as defense counsel are sitting there saying in order to prepare my case, not only to get into issues of mitigation, but even to mount a defense as to aggravation, I need to find out whether there is anything that a psychiatrist can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.043" offset="1035000">You are not a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.774" offset="1042001">You don't have the ability to give that... to make that assessment initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.039" offset="1063003">In order to make that assessment initially, you have to call in a psychiatrist, a psychologist, some mental health professional to give you the expertise to tell you whether there is anything to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.625" offset="1105426">Even before you decide to in fact mount some sort of psychiatric case or psychologically based defense, in order to make that initial assessment, you have to have an expert to assist you, and that, of course, is basically what Ake versus Oklahoma said in a slightly different context, that in such a situation where mental condition is fairly an issue, that it is a requirement of the due process clause that indigent defendants have an expert appointed to assist counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.395" offset="1232486">The problem is, of course, the Virginia Supreme Court says in essence that is fine, but only if the prosecution can later call that person, that member of the defense team as their own witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.203" offset="1279715">In other words, Virginia says that you can't do you job without giving away your client's privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.158" offset="1307509">And the problem that counsel in this case would be confronted with and counsel in every capital case would be confronted with is how do you balance or should you even be forced to balance those two rights, the right to put on... the right to put on mitigating evidence or at least the right to counter the state's proof in aggravation on the one hand, and on the other hand the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.986" offset="1414820">It is important to remember the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.048" offset="1427046">The very first witness called by the prosecution at the sentencing phase was Dr. Pile, and Dr. Pile was called for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to say, Dr. Pile, please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what Michael Smith told you about this earlier incident on the schoolbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.109" offset="1499352">In other words, everything that happened thereafter, all the psychiatric evidence that came in, all of the opinion evidence, all the cross examination was directly flowing from that problem.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="345.057" offset="1543134">What you are suggesting is that that should be treated the same way under the same rules as though it had been offered by the prosecution in the case in chief where guilt was--</text>

            <text syncTime="357.705" offset="1593707">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.285" offset="1599976">Gibson versus Zahradnick, of course, is the case that we were working under as we were coming up through the Fourth Circuit, and it is a case that says very explicitly exactly that, and in fact every federal court that has looked at the issue has said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.825" offset="1654206">The Virginia Supreme Court decision on 1975 I think truly was an aberration, but every federal court has said you cannot call a psychiatrist simply to say in the course of the psychiatric examination the person confessed having committed the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.890" offset="1798402">Well, the defense had asked that another examiner, Dr. Pile, be appointed.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.316" offset="1836123">Because everyone had copies of the letters from Dr. Pile, I think it is fair to say that the prosecutor would sit there and say, I don't think they are going to want him, but he was not subpoenaed by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.413" offset="1880531">He was subpoenaed by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.593" offset="1889204">So he was called by the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.129" offset="1923372">Are you suggesting, Mr. Snook, that in the penalty hearing at the second stage the same rules of evidence apply across the board as in the basic prosecution?</text>

          <turn speaker="j_lloyd_snook_iii" startTime="454.227" stopTime="534.351">
            <label>Mr. J. Lloyd Snook, III</label>
            <text syncTime="454.227" offset="1979797">--They don't apply exactly across the board in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.900" offset="1994425">There are a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.922" offset="1998605">One of them, Green versus Georgia, comes to mind, where some mitigating evidence may be admissible that would not otherwise be admissible under a state court rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.907" offset="2034549">But as far as the general rules of the game, of how... of who has to go forward with what, who has what burden of persuasion, what burden of production, those same basic rules do apply, and in fact the Virginia Supreme Court said so in the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.877" offset="2098392">Remember, of course, that the Smith case was the first case in Virginia under the new capital sentencing statutes, and so to a certain extent a lot of what was going on in the Smith case was the first run, almost experimentation, if you will, and in that case one of the issues that came up was whether the prosecution had the right to present rebuttal at the argument phase of the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.445" offset="2200688">And the Court said, yes, basically any time the prosecution has the burden of proof, then they have the right to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.660" offset="2233498">So in every instance under Virginia law certainly it may vary from state to state, but under Virginia law the courts have always held... have always decided that procedural rules that govern who does what at what time are basically the same as they would be at guilt phase.</text>

I guess the reason it would matter is if there was definitely a question about some evidence being aggravating, some evidence being mitigating, and I suppose the question of whether the door had been opened, the Virginia Supreme Court has never gotten into questions of whether the door was open to a particular kind of testimony or any of the other kinds of considerations that would sometimes get in the way of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.563" offset="2441119">Some of the examples that come to mind are United States versus Nobles, for example, where there is a question about the door having been opened by certain things.</text>

Gibson versus Commonwealth pointed that out, where there were cases coming down right and left in other jurisdictions cited in Criminal Law Reporter and other places where the amicus brief raised the issue, and there wasn't even any sort of attempt to supplement the record or supplement the assignments of error...

            <label>Mr. James E. Kulp</label>
            <text syncTime="1750.771" offset="7165939">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we respectfully submit that the Fifth Amendment issue is not properly before the Court because of this Court's ruling in the case of Wainwright versus Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.912" offset="7226543">As Mr. Snook has indicated, at the trial of the case the defense attorney did make an objection to the testimony of Dr. Pile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.621" offset="7269384">I think the reading of the record would indicate that that objection was based solely on the Fifth Amendment ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.164" offset="7299581">The attorney at the state habeas proceeding was asked specifically why he did not raise the issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.692" offset="7341690">He testified that he had and his associates had examined the law and determined that in their judgment this issue would not be meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.590" offset="7389233">I think the Court has to recognize that what the attorney has to do and what this Court has indicated that attorneys are supposed to do is exercise professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.657" offset="7433537">In Jones versus Barnes the Court clearly indicated that on appeal, that counsel were not required under the Constitution to raise all non-frivolous issues, that counsel was supposed to winnow out those arguments which they believed would be meritorious and those which they believed would not be meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.121" offset="7523398">In this case, counsel indicated and the testimony is clear that after the trial they went through the transcript and looked at every objection which had been raised during the course of the trial, and they considered each one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.123" offset="7587346">Than after making the decision that this particular issue would not be meritorious, they then raised 17 issues on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.278" offset="7627992">We submit that what counsel did in this case is fully consistent with what the Court has indicated that counsel is supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.304" offset="7660071">I would respond to Mr. Snook by indicating that there was an amicus brief filed in the Supreme Court of Virginia on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.361" offset="7712316">I would disagree with Mr. Snook as to what issues the amicus brief raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.898" offset="7742513">The amicus brief did not question at all the testimony of Dr. Pile as it related to the bus incident.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1904.853" offset="7782324">Mr. Kulp, let me interrupt you for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.327" offset="7792146">In our Court we have a rule that amicus cannot enlarge the issues before the Court that are presented by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.801" offset="7826105">Do you know if the Supreme Court of Virginia has a similar rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_kulp" startTime="1918.283" stopTime="2301.756">
            <label>Mr. James E. Kulp</label>
            <text syncTime="1918.283" offset="7836032">They do in this respect, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.285" offset="7855989">In this specific case that we are talking about, in the Supreme Court opinion, in Footnote Number 1, the Supreme Court of Virginia specifically said they would not recognize any arguments raised by an amicus which had not been raised and briefed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.660" offset="7933521">So, I think that that is the same rule which this Court applies, and I would say that the amicus brief, as I indicated, did not focus on, did not raise any question about the testimony which is now being raised in this Court as such an egregious admission of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.452" offset="8016695">What they were concerned about, they indicated that, one, an example for competency and sanity was not sufficient to focus on future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.748" offset="8057864">They also argued that only forensic psychiatrists should be called upon to determine dangerousness, and further, that the Fifth Amendment applies when the defendant is ordered to undergo an examination to determine dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.119" offset="8111362">Not once in the amicus brief, even, did they raise the issue that this evidence was harmful in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.263" offset="8143963">On the reply brief, the petitioner has tried to indicate that since this is an appellate default, that the rules of this Court in Wainwright versus Sykes would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.123" offset="8195372">I have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.975" offset="8206761">First of all, when the petition was filed in the District Court, Federal District Court, and we filed our response and for the first time raised the procedural argument under Wainwright versus Sykes, the petitioner did not at that time raise any question that there was any distinction between trial omission and failure to raise the omission on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.634" offset="8321387">Again, when we went to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the petitioner never questioned the fact that Wainwright versus Sykes applied in an appellate default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.801" offset="8366108">I would also say I think that this Court has recently addressed that issue in Reed versus Ross, which itself was an appellate default case, and the Court went on to indicate that the reasons that Wainwright versus Sykes applied even in an appellate default situation is because it affords the states the opportunity to resolve the issue shortly after the trial, while the evidence is still available both to assess the defendant's claims and to retry effectively if the defendant prevails, and secondly, to foster finality of the decision by forcing the defendant to litigate all claims together as quickly after trial as the docket will allow while the appellate court has its attention focused on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.820" offset="8550115">We submit that in this case the District Court clearly found there was a waiver under Wainwright versus Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.757" offset="8589926">The Fourth Circuit in our view did not address the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.110" offset="8611346">We believe they should have affirmed on that ground alone, and we wouldn't have the issues being raised in this Court such as the questions of whether the Fifth Amendment applies or whether it does not apply as the amicus in this Court have tried to bring in a Sixth Amendment claim, which we submit has never, ever been raised in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.168" offset="8711552">So, we submit that this issue is not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.499" offset="8728897">I would also indicate that the question is whether counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the claim on appeal, thereby meeting the cause prong of Wainwright versus Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.081" offset="8799219">The petitioner refers to the Fourth Circuit ruling in Gibson versus Zahradnick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.586" offset="8825237">The author of that opinion was Chief Justice Hainsworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.940" offset="8842686">It is notable that in a subsequent case, Conquiss versus Mitchell, Judge Hainsworth indicated that Gibson versus Zahradnick did not apply in those circumstances where the defendant retained a private psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.924" offset="8926592">Now, in the Conquiss case were the same facts as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.888" offset="8950415">The defendant came in and asked the Court to appoint a private psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.451" offset="8972672">The Court merely entered an order so that the psychiatrist could be paid, but the Court did not choose the psychiatrist, had nothing to do with it other than entering the order for the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.709" offset="9021677">Those are precisely the same facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.120" offset="9035366">At the state habeas hearing, the trial judge indicated that the only thing he had to do with the psychiatrist, Dr. Pile in this case, was simply to enter the order to allow him to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.280" offset="9091999">The Judge did not select him, did not require him to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.174" offset="9115614">We think that the facts are identical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.976" offset="9126794">We would also submit that in this case there is no question, and as Mr. Snook has conceded today, as he had in the Fourth Circuit, this evidence in no way had any effect upon the separate and distinct finding of vileness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.998" offset="9202863">I would also note that this evidence is not evidence which would mislead the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.723" offset="9229717">It is not evidence which is erroneous because there is no question but this evidence was in fact true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.512" offset="9272975">So, to try to indicate that this evidence which the jury could have heard if we assume for a minute that there would be something wrong with Dr. Pile testifying, which we do not concede, but just assuming it, the jury could clearly have heard the same type of evidence, the same exact statement about the bus incident from some other declarant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.022" offset="9879016">That is, one of the underlying rationales in Zant was the fact that there was mandatory appellate review which we have in Virginia just like it was in Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.063" offset="9999179">I think that is important, because I think that simply goes to the overall way the case has come about is that I think everyone, the Fourth Circuit as well as the Virginia Supreme Court, has considered that that evidence was just inconsequential, and had no impact.</text>

Gibson simply does not apply to a fact situation where in this case, as it was in Conquiss, the defendant comes in and asks the court to appoint him a private psychiatrist, whom he names, and all the court does is simply enter the order to allow him to be paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.659" offset="11249504">First of all, as far us the question of whether the amicus brief even in fact presented this issue, the answer is, it did, and if you look at the amicus brief that is in the record, Pages 56 through 61, there is a six-page discussion based on Smith versus Estelle of exactly how this evidence ought to be treated and how it ought to be ruled inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.473" offset="11324737">Now, as far as the procedural default issues there are a couple of points that I think need to be reiterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.015" offset="11346889">One is that this is in fact a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.867" offset="11358383">That means not only that somebody is going to be executed about all... if in fact this issue is not... doesn't result in a reversal, but more importantly, the additional obligations that are imposed by this Court on the Virginia Supreme Court in reviewing these cases have to be considered as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.066" offset="11655134">Now, the other point that I wanted to make relating to that is simply that counsel's failure in this case was the failure to research the law, not just to make the appeal, but failure to research the law, and that was the inexcusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.674" offset="11709573">That is the cause for the failure to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.887" offset="11722425">As far as the Zant versus Stephens questions, first of all, we obviously agree with Justice Stevens that what we are talking about here is a harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.473" offset="11764744">In neither Zant nor Barclay was there an independent constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.136" offset="11779372">Those cases do not displace the harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.269" offset="11799957">Michael Smith was entitled to a constitutionally fair sentencing hearing free of harmful error, free of harmful constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.063" offset="11835170">Finally, the constitutional flaw is not in the vileness finding, but is in the jury's decision to impose the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.239" offset="11863800">It is not enough under Virginia law to find one aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.571" offset="11881145">You have to go beyond that to find that the jury is going to recommend the death sentence based on all the evidence that it has heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.119" offset="11915313">In other words, we are back to the question of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.893" offset="11926494">You cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt using the harmless error analysis that this jury heard and based its decision on only admissible evidence.</text>
