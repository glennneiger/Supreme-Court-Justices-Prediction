            <label>Mr. Richard H. Burr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="11.356" offset="171941">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.676" offset="189286">The case of Alvin Ford is before you today on a record which raises grave questions about Mr. Ford's competence to be executed, notwithstanding the Governor's determination in Florida that Mr. Ford is competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.519" offset="252607">The record shows a gradual, unrelenting deterioration of Mr. Ford's mental health from late December 1981 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="291895">The record shows that by 1982 Mr. Ford was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia by a psychiatrist familiar with his medical history.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.116" offset="335049">Yet, this psychiatrist's recommendation for therapy and medication was ignored by prison staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="363993">The record further shows that by late 1983, when Mr. Ford's deterioration began to compromise his competence to be executed, he was examined by three psychiatrists appointed by the Governor of Florida and by a fourth psychiatrist at the request of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="441838">Three of these psychiatrists agreed that Mr. Ford suffered from psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.920" offset="470259">The record shows that, despite this substantial agreement on medical diagnosis, the Governor's psychiatrists disagreed with the defense psychiatrist concerning the legal consequences as to Mr. Ford's competency of his medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.115" offset="539013">Finally, the record shows that in determining Mr. Ford's competence to be executed, the Florida Governor held no hearing of any kind to sort out which of the conflicting psychiatric opinions was more reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.291" offset="599722">Indeed, the record shows that the Governor may not have even considered the opinion and reasoning of the defense psychiatrist who found that Mr. Ford was incompetent to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.349" offset="647892">These deficiencies in the Governor's competency determination process created, we submit, a grave risk that the decision that Mr. Ford was competent was erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.528" offset="1540652">Historically, from as far back as we've been able to trace it, at least to the thirteenth century, the common law has flatly prohibited the execution of the incompetent.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.359" offset="1740019">The Court likened the protection of this interest to clemency, which was a wholly discretionary process in which various reasons for mercy could be submitted by a condemned person, and the Governor or other clemency authority said yes or no, depending wholly on that party's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.059" offset="1834791">So from that perspective, the Court did I believe begin with the question of how is this enforced and get to the question of it's not an enforceable right protected by the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.032" offset="2082641">But for the state-created right, the Governor, assuming he acts with impartiality and detachment, could be an appropriate decision maker.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.382" offset="3644032">Now, that, as I understand the Court's decisions, requires a couple of critical components that can't be taken care of on paper: the right to present evidence and to have it understood through questioning by the fact finder; and the right to cross-examine adverse evidence, and again with the notion of assisting the fact finder to make the most reliable decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.219" offset="3867431">Basically, there would be three components:</text>
            <text syncTime="937.654" offset="3877149">The first would be similar to the Florida test, whether the person understands the nature and effect of the death sentence and why it's being imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.769" offset="3965652">And the third part of the standard would be based on an access to courts concern, and that is whether the person has sufficient capacity to know any facts which might cause his conviction or sentence to be reversed and the ability to communicate it to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.988" offset="4398448">Taking trial competency as an example, in Drope the Court isolated three factors that were material to the threshold determination:</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.179" offset="4447245">Evidence of irrational behavior, which I suppose might or might not be related to the Dusky test of competency; the defendant's demeanor at trial or pretrial proceedings; and prior medical opinion as to competency to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.658" offset="4513178">Now, the Court, as I read Drope and its progeny, certainly left latitude for one of these factors to be a sufficient threshold if it was strong enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.048" offset="4566781">And I suppose if the person, again in a trial competency context, were so irrational that it was quite clear that that person had no capacity to understand the nature of the charges against him and to assist counsel, even though there was no explicit logical relationship, that would be enough to satisfy the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.981" offset="4658419">So I think if you had that kind of profound mental illness, that would be sufficient, just as it would in a trial competency context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.866" offset="5594021">Well, I think, as I understand the medical literature and the research that has been done on death and dying, the medical profession understands now that there is an ameliorative psychiatrical process that seems to be common to being a human being, that people go through in different ways when their death is imminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.750" offset="5693495">I think there was an intuitive grasp of that back in the Middle Ages, when people spoke about the need to make peace with God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.206" offset="5735395">But I think that has been secularly understood as a common and universal psychiatrical process in the twentieth century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.347" offset="5779908">I'd like to talk briefly about not only the threshold that we submit must be met, but how the determination itself, again whether the right is from the Eighth Amendment or the state-created right, why the Constitution requires that there be a more reliable determination of competency than was present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.247" offset="5891503">There are two reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.699" offset="5901325">The first I submit is found in this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence over the last decade and a half, since the Furman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.555" offset="5940718">Since Furman, the Court has clearly articulated on a number of occasions that, because the taking of a person's life by the state is qualitatively different in its severity and irrevocability than any other form of punishment, the decision to take life must be correspondingly more reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.372" offset="6039983">And the Court has assured that there is this kind of greater reliability by requiring that the decision maker take into account all of the reasons proffered for not taking someone's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.013" offset="6090556">Now, obviously there are some clear differences between the decision to impose the death sentence at the outset and the decision to carry out a death sentence against a person who may be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.321" offset="6139875">But there's a very fundamental commonality between those decisions as well, because in both instances what's at issue is whether or not life will be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.728" offset="6189403">And the irrevocability of that decision certainly informs the need for reliability as to the competency determination, just as much as it informs the need for a reliable sentencing decision at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.805" offset="6245723">Likewise, the procedural assurance of reliability, that the decision maker take into account all of the countervailing reasons for taking life, should be applicable to the competency decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.517" offset="6312597">And it's quite clear that the Florida procedure does not allow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.236" offset="6331510">The Florida procedure for determining competency does not require the decision maker to take into account the evidence indicating the person is incompetent if the source of that evidence falls outside of the three psychiatrists appointed by the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.197" offset="6403294">It's that need for reliability that the taking of life in this context requires that we find in the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.838" offset="6449896">The second ground is simply from the due process clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.725" offset="6473407">For more than 100 years, this Court has repeatedly held that any party adversely affected, to be adversely affected by state action, has a right to be heard on the question of the appropriateness of the state's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.401" offset="6532130">That's not simply a matter of being fair, although it certainly is that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.822" offset="6557834">But it's also a matter of wanting state actions to be reliable, because we, for better than 100 years, for 200 years, have entrusted an adversarial process as getting us more reliable decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.815" offset="6613841">It's that reliability which the Court has drawn on time and time again in the mental health forensic cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.501" offset="7036502">This Court has always been careful, however, to balance the need for finality against the need for a reliable decision making when death is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.873" offset="7082060">In the context of this issue, if there is a constitutionally reliable decision making process at the outset finality will be possible to achieve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.335" offset="7967924">The Governor of Florida has determined that Alvin Ford is competent to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.322" offset="7987777">The fact that this occurred does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment right, and the requirements of procedural due process were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.576" offset="8020796">At this point the state should be entitled to carry out its lawfully imposed sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.229" offset="8043470">There is no question Alvin Ford was sane in 1974 when he committed the offense of first degree murder and when he was tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.604" offset="8080982">In 1984, the Governor of Florida determined that he was sane to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.258" offset="8107523">This was done through the procedure outlined in Florida Statute 92207.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.179" offset="8131242">Upon being informed by Ford's attorneys that they believed Ford was insane, the Governor appointed a commission of three psychiatrists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.435" offset="8164261">The commissioners were directed to examine Ford and to determine if he understood the nature of the death penalty and why it was to be imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.040" offset="8202713">The three commissioners personally examined Alvin Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.342" offset="8219954">They met with his attorneys and accepted materials prepared by the attorneys and submitted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.146" offset="8243150">They reviewed his prison records and they spoke to prison personnel having daily contact with Ford.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.706" offset="8517332">We submit the Florida statute carries through the common law humanitarian policy and that this does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.264" offset="8555575">In the first place, the deferment of execution of the insane is only a temporary reprieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.585" offset="8580861">It does not affect the fact that the sentence of death is lawful and it does not in any way cancel it or suggest that its imposition was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.708" offset="8617328">For this reason, we submit that the claim raised by Ford does not fall within the traditional scope of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.464" offset="8648362">There have been various justifications advanced, both at common law and now, as to why this prohibition should exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.902" offset="8686187">But none of them are... there is no one single compelling rationale which has been generally accepted or which Ford suggests now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.573" offset="8716803">As to the argument that it would perhaps prematurely cut off access to the courts, Ford concedes that this is not true in his case because he had ten years of litigation and ample opportunities for judicial review prior to any claim of insanity being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.618" offset="8789005">As to the insanity perhaps being punishment enough, of course, this isn't true either, because upon restoration to mental health the sentence would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.076" offset="8826830">As to the argument that there should be opportunity to prepare for death, I think we should put this is perspective and consider the very little opportunity the victim in this case had to prepare for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.550" offset="8872701">He saw a shotgun pointed at his head and saw a shot go off, and that was the end of his opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.204" offset="8899346">And Ford certainly had ten years to prepare himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.641" offset="9129119">I think that the Florida standard is appropriate and it should be the only criteria that is necessary to determine, and that is again if he understands the nature of the penalty and why it's to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.115" offset="9174990">That somewhat incorporates preparation for death also, because if he understands what's happening that should be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.453" offset="9204352">We submit the penalty is just and therefore this determination, like clemency, falls outside the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.958" offset="9238416">In Roberts versus the United States, to answer a couple of questions that came up, the D.C. Circuit held that the development of a mental disorder after incarceration is not cruel and unusual and unusual punishment because the sentence itself remains lawful, and the fact that a particular person has a problem adapting to prison does not cancel the punishment or give rise to an Eight Amendment claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.413" offset="9796182">Nothing, no developments in the law that have occurred since Solesbee have in any way diluted the validity of the Court's reasoning in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.285" offset="9831709">The Gardner case, which came up in recent times, dealt with the initial selection of persons who were to be sentenced to death and did not deal with post-conviction insanity, like this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.211" offset="9891372">We submit that, since all judicial remedies had been exhausted at the point when the claim was made and that due process can be flexible, that this procedure that we have in Florida adequately balances the competing interests identified by this Court is the Mathews versus Eldridge opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.858" offset="9965978">We submit that Ford's private interest at this point is minimal, because he has had many, many years in which the validity of the judgment and sentence have been litigated directly and collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.682" offset="10021253">And on the other hand, the state does have a valid interest in bringing an end to litigation and carrying out this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.438" offset="10056257">In this case, no claim of insanity was every presented to any court until ten days prior to the scheduled date of execution, although, the claim being that the Governor's procedure was inadequate, certainly a judicial determination could have been sought at an earlier time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.102" offset="10134938">The district court did find an abuse of the writ in this case, and the Eleventh Circuit didn't reach that issue, but I think it's appropriate to note that we do have a valid interest in finality and that this is one reason why our present procedure is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.646" offset="10201080">The Governor can make the determination in a reasonably expeditious manner, and that properly respects the individual's interest, but it also serves the state's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.288" offset="10247683">We submit that the risk of erroneous deprivation is negligible because the Governor is advised by a panel of experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.310" offset="10283732">In the Gilmore versus Utah case, this Court was willing to accept expert determinations in the state system of competency to waive direct appellate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.867" offset="10330021">So certainly in this case, many years after the original conviction, the Governor's determination, which was based on expert opinions, can be accepted and it can bring this matter to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.425" offset="10384251">Our statute strikes the proper balance between these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.263" offset="10403581">In Barefoot versus Estelle, this Court took note that federal habeas corpus is not a forum to relitigate state trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.952" offset="10442347">And certainly, it's even less so a means by which a defendant can indefinitely delay execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.839" offset="10469932">Therefore in this case, bearing that in mind, we submit that the state has properly respected Alvin Ford's concerns and that the judgment and sentence are lawful, his competency has been determined, and that the Eleventh Circuit properly ruled in this case to affirm the judgment denying the petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.038" offset="10562719">If there are no further questions, I'd ask that that decision be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.442" offset="10580274">Thank you.</text>
