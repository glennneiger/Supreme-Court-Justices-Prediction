            <text syncTime="14.324" offset="190110">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.076" offset="201082">The issue in this case is the validity of Pennsylvania's rule permitting the Commonwealth to appeal an insufficiency determination made at the close of a timely rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.852" offset="252177">The rule was established with very little discussion or analysis at a time when the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.789" offset="283942">With this case it suddenly became a rule in season of a rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.160" offset="301392">The defendants were charged each with two counts of murder and various lesser charges as a result of a fire in a restaurant-apartment building that they owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.068" offset="349039">The trial was non-jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="357190">The case was largely circumstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.039" offset="368997">At the close of the Commonwealth's case, the defendants challenged the sufficiency of the Commonwealth's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="393239">They did this with a motion that we call a demurrer in Pennsylvania, a demurrer to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="417167">The issue raised by a demurrer to the evidence is the same as the issue raised by a Rule 29 motion in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.350" offset="446215">If it's true, is it enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.802" offset="456037">The court found that the evidence, even if true, was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that either of the defendants set the fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.316" offset="542032">Yes, but the Commonwealth had rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="558855">The court, however, denied demurrer with respect to involuntary manslaughter and various lesser charges involving a reckless state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.510" offset="610786">The District Attorney's office appealed the order sustaining the demurrer and asked that trial of the remaining charges be stayed depending the outcome of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.318" offset="654045">The District Attorney's office also asked for reconsideration of the order sustaining the demurrer, and the Commonwealth presently finds it significant, as they indicate at footnote 11 at page 46 of their brief, that the defendants at that juncture joined in the Commonwealth's request that the ruling in favor of the defendants be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.748" offset="743802">We put our reasons on the record at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.350" offset="754146">Defendants wanted so desperately to complete the trial on the involuntary manslaughter and the remaining charges that they were willing to suffer the reinstatement of the murder charges with all the risks that that entailed, so that they could complete the trial rather than have the trial interrupted for an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.177" offset="1025506">We wanted to know where we stood with the court on all the charges, so that we should know what charges we should direct our defense to.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.081" offset="1049121">On reconsideration the court reaffirmed its original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.550" offset="1066989">The remaining charges were stayed over our objection pending the outcome of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.453" offset="1094574">Two and a half years later the Superior Court quashed the appeal on double jeopardy grounds and invalidated the Pennsylvania rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.142" offset="1129369">They reconfirmed that decision on re-argument about a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.444" offset="1146610">About a year ago the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed and remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits of the Commonwealth appeal, and it was at that juncture that we asked for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.252" offset="1197810">The Commonwealth's position, as I understand it, is that since the trial judge made no decision with respect to credibility in ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence, his decision does not go to the factual elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.196" offset="1261549">It's unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.981" offset="1276700">Essentially, the Commonwealth looks at Scott, sees the words "factual guilt", and thinks that this Court is saying that there is another, unrelated kind of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.085" offset="1305121">I can find no language in either Martin Linen or Scott that suggests that kind of distinction or that in any way suggests there has to be a credibility determination before there can be an acquittal, and I think Burks is clearly to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.085" offset="1389131">What they're saying is, since the judge did not determine whether the evidence presented on behalf of the Commonwealth was true, but assumed it to be true for purposes of deciding on the demurrer, his ruling was not an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.658" offset="1443466">It did not go to the merits of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.264" offset="1477843">That's the Commonwealth's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.533" offset="1486933">I would submit also that this case presents a stronger case against allowing review than Martin Linen because in Martin Linen the defendant had been looking at retrial before the insufficiency decision was made, because the jury had been discharged without reaching a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.326" offset="1550150">Martin Linen, I believe, also discloses a manifest necessity argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.780" offset="1567913">There was clearly no mistrial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.565" offset="1579093">I believe that the Commonwealth's argument that the defendants waived their double jeopardy rights by challenging the sufficiency of the evidence when they did is adequately answered by Sanabria.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.473" offset="1630711">I would add that this case presents none of the quirks of the Sanabria case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.258" offset="1645862">There are no evidentiary rulings at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.960" offset="1656625">This was basically a circumstantial case that the trial court found did not measure up to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.748" offset="1779818">The Burks decision, as I understand it, did not turn on any credibility determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.316" offset="1802074">There was a conclusion in Burks that no matter what evidence the court might believe, it still is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.222" offset="1833735">No decision had been made in the Burks case as to credibility of witnesses, but the decision was still an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.695" offset="1871560">I note that there has been some disagreement within this Court as to whether every refinement of double jeopardy law as developed in federal cases applies lock, stock and barrel to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.502" offset="1918790">I would hope that however that debate ultimately turns out, the states will not be held to be free to avoid the finality of acquittals by calling acquittals something else when they're entered at the close of the Commonwealth's case, a stage well after when the defendant has been placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.447" offset="1990574">I would hope also that the states are not going to be free to hold that a defendant waives his Double Jeopardy rights by asking to be acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.653" offset="2027459">The rights involved here may not be quite as fundamental as the right not to be retried after a classic, traditional jury verdict of not guilty, but I would submit that they are certainly not peripheral or incidental to the purposes of the double jeopardy clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.516" offset="3346852">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="805.984" offset="3356778">The matter before the Court raises an important question relating to the proper role of the Pennsylvania trial judge in deciding whether a criminal case shall proceed to verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.757" offset="3399828">In the Commonwealth's view, the trial judge in this case was not asked to sit in judgment, but rather was requested to determine that judgment could not be entered at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.814" offset="3444027">The motion made below by the respondents was reflective of Pennsylvania's desire for specificity and particularity when raising claims of sufficiency of the evidence, in the context of the legal standard to be applied in evaluating the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.943" offset="3516543">Clearly, a trial judge has a separate function in determining whether or not there is sufficiency of evidence factually to determine guilt, as opposed to determining whether or not the law requires that the judgment be sought in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.054" offset="3581013">The Commonwealth is very aware of this Court's discussion with regard to the talismanic nature of particular words, and the Commonwealth doesn't want to rely on the word "demurrer" as providing any special significance in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.164" offset="3641408">However, the term "demurrer" is reflective of Pennsylvania's desire that was set forth in the case of Martin Linen Supply, that the federal system did not provide, that is, a restriction on the power of the trial judge to rule in midtrial, requests regarding the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.846" offset="3736181">Now, the question that has arisen with regard to what difference would occur before this trial judge on remand, I suggest to the Court that there is a different mental process that the Court would go through in determining whether, specifically as a matter of law, the Commonwealth prosecutor has established a case within the framework of the definition of the crime as opposed to whether or not the Commonwealth, the prosecutor, has established sufficient evidence to convince a finder of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime, that the crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.869" offset="3880272">There is a different mental process that I suggest is important to reflect and to be recognized in a system such as Pennsylvania's.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.366" offset="4270228">What the Commonwealth is suggesting is that the Pennsylvania procedure here is not providing, at this stage in the trial, through demurrer, the equivalent of a not guilty verdict by a jury.</text>
