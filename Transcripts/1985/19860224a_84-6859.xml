            <text syncTime="103.540" offset="552474">He attempted to prove this obviously for the purpose of persuading the jury whose sole decision of the sentencing phase was whether to send him to prison for life or whether to sentence him to death, that if he were sentenced to life instead of death, he could be expected to continue to conduct himself in a non-violent manner, and that he would adapt successfully and non-violently to the regime of imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.362" offset="1059772">South Carolina has again and again and again adhered to the position first expressed in Koon I, which was the basis of the ruling here that the issue of the future good conduct of a defendant in prison is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.453" offset="1116092">However, in Koon II, a case decided nearly a year after this trial, and thus of no relevance to what happened here, the Court said that past good conduct in jail is admissible but only as general evidence of the good character of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.594" offset="1184742">It is not admissible on the issue of good conduct in jail, which the Court has continued over and over again to say is inadmissible, and proof of that, our position is that the South Carolina Supreme Court has repeatedly, beginning with Koon I and as recently as State against Chaffee, cited in my brief, upheld the exclusion of expert psychiatric testimony which was focusing solely on whether or not based on a psychiatric evaluation of this defendant his likely future conduct in prison would be good.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.934" offset="1310025">That conduct is always excluded, and it is always excluded under South Carolina law on grounds of relevancy, that is, the relevancy of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.359" offset="1343775">There has never been a case in which a psychiatrist offering his testimony was held to have offered him competent testimony, unreliable testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.755" offset="3765326">At bottom, I read Lockett to be concerned with accuracy, with reliability, with the concern of the Eighth Amendment, and if we are to sentence people to death, let it not be in error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.329" offset="11379602">Yes, Your Honor, only two points which I would like to touch on very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.173" offset="11395067">One, I think it should just be mentioned that what the state now argues is the very core of this case, and their entire submission is a point never before raised by the state below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.400" offset="11431952">It is not until the state came to this Court that it asserted for the first time that all that was being offered to cite what the record clearly shows is some sort of incompetent lay opinion testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.595" offset="11472703">There was no reason for the state to make any such argument, because South Carolina law is so clear that the issue of future conduct in prison at least when the behavior is likely to be good is inadmissible as a matter of law and is categorically excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.253" offset="11531321">That is what State against Koon said, the exact testimony that was excluded by the psychiatric witness, and it is contained in Justice Marshall's opinion in Patterson versus South Carolina in Footnote 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.010" offset="11574371">The expert said, I conclude that Koon would be a very good risk for good adjustment in an institution, and a very low risk for assaultive or violent behavior in an institutional setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.090" offset="11618675">I don't think that has anything to do with how often he would have taken a shower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.060" offset="11634557">Counsel for the state keeps saying over and over again in his argument that these various family witnesses were permitted to testify, and he notes that a written mitigating circumstance was submitted to the jury dealing with future conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.740" offset="11693281">There are inconsistencies in the trial judges' actions in this case, but there is a way of explaining all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.274" offset="11719403">That which was objected to by the state was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.846" offset="11729748">There was no objection to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.588" offset="11736644">There was no objection to the defendant's own statements on the witness stand, and therefore the judge let it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.990" offset="11754303">There was no objection to the written mitigating circumstance that was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.483" offset="11768304">Therefore the judge submitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.383" offset="11775828">The problem with the written mitigating circumstance is, it had virtually no evidence to back it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.598" offset="11792755">The prosecutor is the one who made use of that bit of writing in the sentencing instructions, because he gave the prosecutor the opening for his extremely effective jury argument about, if you send this fellow to prison, he is going to rape other boy inmates in the jail, because that is the kind of inmate he is, and you know that based on what you know about him, and on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.028" offset="11870391">That is why there was no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.771" offset="11877392">I don't think the trial judge was all that confused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.446" offset="12036112">--The main point I really got to my feet again to make was simply in the answer to Justice O'Connor's questions and the answers to Justice Steven's question were not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.055" offset="12082505">That the state gave the law in South Carolina could not be clearer that the issue of future good conduct in prison is inadmissible as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.190" offset="12115106">In this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court cited Koon I in saying that evidence of future adjustability or adaptability to prison was properly excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.895" offset="12145930">A few months later, in State against Elmore, the case... the South Carolina court made an identical ruling based purely... in a case which involved only the exclusion of three prison guards who had had this man for two years, and when the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of that testimony, solely evidence that there is prior good conduct, the state court cited State against Skipper as their authority, so I don't think there is any question about what South Carolina law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.985" offset="12266303">My last point that I would like to make is simply that the state in a... at the last moment said that the evidence here is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.131" offset="12302874">This Court has never suggested that an actual violation the rule of Lockett against Ohio, that an actual exclusion of relevant mitigating evidence can ever be... If there ever could be harmless error, that is to say, if a reviewing court were ever able to say with certainty that an error of this sort could not have affected the jury's judgment, surely this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.096" offset="12394721">For all we know based on this record, Ronald Skipper is on death row today precisely because of the argument that the state made which he was prevented from responding to with competent evidence and the state's own jailers prepared, ready, and willing to testify on his behalf, and on that basis we submit that this death sentence may not be carried out consistent with the commands of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
