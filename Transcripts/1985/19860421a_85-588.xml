            <text syncTime="21.504" offset="218914">The issue before the Court is whether traditional principles of full faith and credit apply in actions under the Reconstruction statutes and Title VII to issues fairly and fully litigated before a state agency acting in a judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.207" offset="289654">Petitioners seek issue preclusion in this action on the basis of a prior state adjudication under the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which Respondent voluntarily invoked for the purpose of protecting his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.020" offset="372932">This prior adjudication was not rendered by a Title VII federal agency within the EEOC Title VII enforcement scheme, but was rendered completely outside the Title VII enforcement scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.153" offset="445448">Petitioners contend that under the decisions of this Court traditional principles of full faith and credit apply to state agency adjudications as well as state court adjudications, unless exempted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.453" offset="514725">Petitioners further contend that neither the Reconstruction statutes nor Title VII repeals the full faith and credit doctrine is applied to state agency adjudications.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.614" offset="703329">But we contend that issue preclusion, not claim preclusion, applies to both 1983 and Title VII on the basis of this prior adjudication, which was a judicial proceeding under the state law of the State of Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.709" offset="1039681">You don't have to do anything to file a lawsuit under 1983 as a precondition to filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.662" offset="1067476">All you have to do is just go down to federal court and sue to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Beauchamp E. Brogan</label>

            <text syncTime="245.762" offset="1115959">Under Title VII the back pay is limited, the damages are limited, whereas under 1983 you're not limited as to back pay, compensatory, punitive damages, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.250" offset="1173846">The period of time of the statute of limitations is different as to both statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.294" offset="1198088">So we think that there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.746" offset="1203835">But we think that under our theory of the case that there's really no different reasons why you should apply one rule as to one scheme and one as to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.473" offset="1246780">We think that under the holdings of this Court that there is no express or implied repeal of the full faith and credit doctrine clearly to 1983, and neither do we think there is as to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.673" offset="1307593">Now, this action arose when the University simply proposed to terminate plaintiff's employment for inadequate work performance and improper job behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.140" offset="1353464">And under the Tennessee Administrative Procedure Act, which is the model uniform act adopted by 31 jurisdictions, the University was required to afford the Respondent an opportunity for a hearing, and he elected to take a hearing under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.263" offset="1429951">Now, that Act has procedural safeguards fully equivalent to the Rules of Civil Procedure, and you have the same type of trial, the same type of hearing, that you would have in the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.100" offset="1593268">But those go to his Title VII claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.513" offset="1606957">Now, the Petitioners do not take issue with the fact that he still would have a right to try his claims to the extent that they are now swallowed up by his issues that were adjudicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.244" offset="1809876">Well, what he claims is that the administrative hearing officer decided the issue all right, but wouldn't let him offer his evidence because the state objected to it, on the question of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.953" offset="1856687">Is that what happened?</text>

            <text syncTime="432.473" offset="1862748">No, Your Honor, that is not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.155" offset="1873510">It is true that certain evidence was not admitted, but the evidence is abundantly clear, and both lower courts found, that he was clearly permitted to introduce evidence of racial discrimination as an affirmative defense to the proposed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.516" offset="1942891">And he insisted on making that election as how he would defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.860" offset="1960341">He chose to defend, and he introduced voluminous testimony, and according to the district court and also the Court of Appeals, virtually every allegation of individual discrimination that he alleged in his federal complaint was litigated in the administrative agency hearing, the individual instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.832" offset="2040171">Now, it's true that his claims, his class action claims, were not litigated and evidence of that was not admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.430" offset="2078623">Rut under the ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, it would be wholly immaterial as to what he was allowed to litigate, because the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did not examine the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.117" offset="2133376">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals clearly said that he was permitted to assert as an affirmative defense the issue of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.625" offset="2175381">But the Sixth Circuit ruled that, without regard to any evidence that he may or may not have presented, absent state court review, no agency's constitution is ever, and I mean ever, entitled to preclusive effect in a subsequent civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.447" offset="2258659">So that under our theory of the case, Your Honor, if ha had been permitted to litigate everything that he wanted to put into evidence and then the ruling had been against him, the Sixth Circuit would have said: You have a right to start all over again: you're not bound by the finding of that law judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.088" offset="2389167">It is plainly a judicial proceeding, because under the nation's statutory scheme a state can enable and enact legislation to permit the executive branch as well as the administrative branch of state government to exercise judicial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.068" offset="2493135">Now, the state of Tennessee and 31 other jurisdictions have done this in the form of adopting this Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.546" offset="2727087">According to the law, the state law says that the only method of judicial review of this federal decision is to file a petition in a state chancery court within 60 days from the date of the final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.756" offset="2795841">And the state statute sets forth the scope of judicial review, which is very similar to the federal Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.081" offset="2829174">It can be set aside if it's contrary to law, if it's contrary to the facts, or if it's not supported by substantial evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.315" offset="2970130">It had the same effect as a state court Judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.667" offset="2983505">It was final and binding on the parties, both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.460" offset="2998656">Now, after the decision is made, the judge found that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant Petitioner's... I mean, the Respondent's termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.366" offset="3042333">He said, considering everything in its proper context, I'm going to find that you're guilt for the eight charges, but I don't think it's sufficient to warrant your termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.534" offset="3082979">But I think you ought to be transferred to another county under new supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.156" offset="3101474">All right, he was transferred to another county.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.858" offset="3112341">60 days, Your Honor, after he was transferred, and 84 days after this agency decision was final, he returned to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.395" offset="3158421">Now, when he returned to federal court, he did not go to federal court and say: Your Honor, I have a right to sue letter under EEOC, here it is; I want a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.802" offset="3196037">What he did was he filed a motion which in effect sought to have the district court review according to the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act the judgment of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.702" offset="3247655">And that's set forth on page 24 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.177" offset="3273569">This is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.358" offset="3278271">He says, the decision of the judge and the agency constituted an abuse of discretion, is contrary to law, and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.227" offset="3341801">Then over in paragraph number 8, he said: The administrative law judge's and agency's decision and remedy... the remedy, that's ordering his transfer... was equally unconstitutional and unlawful in wrongfully rejecting said claims of racial discrimination despite clear evidence thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.793" offset="3448067">Now, if it please the Court, he made no argument before the district court that the evidence... that he didn't have a full and fair opportunity to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.422" offset="3490594">He said the evidence in overwhelming that the decision is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.324" offset="3510134">Now, the district court said: Well, I, number one, don't have authority to review it under the Administrative Procedure Act, because that places the statutory authority to review it in the state court, subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals and on up to the Tennessee Supreme Court if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.716" offset="3579724">Now, then he said... and he applied the full faith and credit doctrine, although he did not use those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.780" offset="3603966">Judge MacRay said: Since you did not appeal that agency decision within the time permitted by law, it is now final; those findings are binding on you, they're binding on the University of Tennessee; you cannot go behind that agency decision: and I cannot undo what is done, I cannot order you back to the place from where you was transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.917" offset="3708560">It's already been accomplished, anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.178" offset="3717546">So Judge MacRay said that under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel that action could not be attacked in this court or any other court, and we think he's entirely right, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.088" offset="3897268">This Court in Thomas versus Washington Gas &amp; Light Company, every member of this court in Thomas, felt that issue preclusion should apply to an agency adjudication, and the plurality said that state agency adjudications were just as entitled to full faith and credit as a state court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.895" offset="3996429">And every member of this Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.997" offset="4008863">The only disagreement was with whether claim preclusion should apply in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.230" offset="4029761">But not one member of this Court dissented with the proposition that issue preclusion should apply to an agency adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.776" offset="4063930">Now, in some of the recent cases that have been decided under these statutes, the Migra case, the Parsons case, which is the most recent case, this Court stated this, and I just wanted to quote it because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.584" offset="4131221">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.005" offset="4132893">"The Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S. Code Section 1738, requires federal courts as well as state courts to give state judicial proceedings the same full faith and credit. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.527" offset="4203006">But that's no revelation, because that's exactly what the statute says, that you have to give full faith and credit to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.613" offset="4231322">The question is what is a judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.493" offset="4238846">Well, I think you'd have to look at the state law, Your Honor, to determine what is a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.727" offset="4263819">And if a judicial proceeding under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which is specifically enacted by the state legislature for the purpose of enabling people to protect their constitutional and statutory rights, where they have the same plenary type right to a hearing as you would have in a federal court... I don't know what a judicial proceeding is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.705" offset="4363711">It's similar, it's very similar to the federal Administrative Procedure Act, and this Court has always ruled, since at least Utah, that decisions under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, even though they're unappealed, are entitled to full faith and credit, even though that's not under this statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1075.895" stopTime="1086.883">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1075.895" offset="4436436">But is that because the Court held that they were judicial proceedings within the meaning of 1738 or just that as a matter of common law preclusion that doctrine ought to apply?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="beauchamp_e_brogan" startTime="1086.883" stopTime="1163.704">
            <label>Mr. Beauchamp E. Brogan</label>
            <text syncTime="1086.883" offset="4480426">Well, it would have to be on the doctrine of common law and traditional principles, because the full faith and credit statute, of course, does not apply to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.369" offset="4522326">But the principle is the same, and we can't find any difference between applying one standard to state agency adjudications and another one to federal adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.226" offset="4565794">And we think that in this case the reason is even more pronounced than in a federal adjudication because if the full faith and credit doctrine applies then it's mandatory that the principle be applied, whereas under the federal agency adjudications it's not mandated and this Court has some leeway and discretion, I suppose, as to whether to apply traditional rules of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.323" offset="4666209">So our position is that if you look at the meaning of the full faith and credit clause and it's implementing statute... and after all, all the statute does is just implement the clause, and the clause very specifically says that it's a judicial proceeding... I mean, if it's a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.886" offset="4740397">Now, of course, if it's not a judicial proceeding within the meaning of that statute and the clause, then I would have to confess, Your Honor, that it's not entitled to full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.426" offset="4786581">But if it is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.197" offset="4857634">I understand that, Your Honor, the statute would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.060" offset="4877069">But it implements the clause, and we think that under the national statutory scheme that the clause and the statute have to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.986" offset="4912805">And we think this Court has always read them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.178" offset="4925552">As a matter of fact, in reading these cases under the full faith and credit doctrine, the Court hardly ever refers to the second part of the statute, that says how you prove the judicial records of a state court, and that's all that section does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.229" offset="4997755">It just says how you prove these judicial records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.570" offset="5007159">But they look to the second part of the statute, which says... which is the important part, and that is the part, if it please the Court, that says you must give them the same full faith and credit that they enjoy in the state of rendition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.619" offset="5063375">Now, we think that if you did not give this judicial proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act full faith and credit, it would in effect nullify and render futile the Administrative Procedure Act in all these various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.050" offset="5125023">And these Administrative Procedure Acts do more than just define the rights of the employer and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.064" offset="5157102">They deal with ratemaking, the suspension and revocation of licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.588" offset="5175179">Just sort of like the federal government's statutory scheme under the APA, where you have the Federal Power Commission, the ICC, the state agency has all sorts of regulatory boards and agencies that come under this Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.367" offset="5230349">And the state of Tennessee has administrative law judges, just like the federal government does, that adjudicate these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.072" offset="5261174">So that if you forget for a moment that this is a civil rights case and say in an ordinary situation would this adjudication be entitled to full faith and credit if it's not appealed and it becomes final and binding on the parties, we say it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.925" offset="5336615">So then the only question is whether the Reconstruction statutes or Title VII expressly or impliedly repealed the full faith and credit doctrine, and we say it doesn't because of the holding of this Court in Allen and Migra with respect to the 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.297" offset="5418013">And with respect to Kremer, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals just swallowed footnote 7 hook, line, and sinker, and said that, based on footnote 7 of Kremer, we will never ever give preclusive effect to a state adjudication without state court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.621" offset="5495335">I want to point out to the Court that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did not recognize the critical distinction between an EEO, the federal agency, and an agency under the Administrative Procedure Act, like we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.442" offset="5562627">Under the agency that was involved in Kremer, the Court's entire opinion deals with an anti-discrimination agency where a litigant or a claimant is required, is mandated by the federal law, that he go to the federal agency route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.384" offset="5642352">And the EEOC does not have any investigative of adjudicative powers, and they only have to give substantial weight to the decision of EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.362" offset="5682268">Well, the EEOC has nothing whatsoever to do with the Administrative Procedure Act proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.135" offset="5705360">It's entirely outside the scope of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.847" offset="5724272">So that we think that is the critical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.211" offset="5741722">Nothing required the Respondent to litigate his claims of racial discrimination before the Administrative Procedures Act... the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.689" offset="5787593">Nothing even demanded that he go there in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.591" offset="5799192">He could go directly to the federal court under the Reconstruction statutes immediately, and he could have prosecuted his right to sue letter, his EEOC complaint, gotten a right to sue letter, and then gone to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.690" offset="5851646">But he did not do that in this case, and we think that that is the critical distinction between the Kremer footnote 7, if footnote 7 is construed to be an implied repeal of the full faith and credit doctrine as to Title VII cases, which is apparently what the Sixth Circuit felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.687" offset="5955613">But this Court did not say that as I read footnote 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.880" offset="5968361">It just said that state agency adjudications that are unreviewed should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.240" offset="5985810">It didn't say that they shall not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.241" offset="5993856">It just said they should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.723" offset="5999708">But as the opinion points out in the Kremer case, nothing required the claimant in that case to appeal his state administration or prescribed the weight that the court would give to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.416" offset="6082568">And that is the same with respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.577" offset="6091136">And I'd like to same the next five minutes for rebuttal, if it please the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.513" offset="6238885">The particular decision is not covered by the full faith and credit clause, because it is not a... that only applies to decisions from state to state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.573" offset="6619123">I don't think that that case announced a broad principle, first of all, as to how administrative agency decisions should be handled by this Court, and certainly not in the context of someone bringing a civil rights action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Ellis</label>
            <text syncTime="1655.987" offset="6756841">That's right, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.109" offset="6769275">And I think that the distinction we would make is that an agency decision when you're going from state to state may be entitled to preclusion if that agency satisfies certain other prerequisites that traditional principles of preclusion require; that in the case where you are not going from state to state, that is from state to federal, federal to state, or federal to federal, that what you must look at is either the federal statute in the case of state to federal or a federal common law if it's not covered by the statute or the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.194" offset="6913680">And that in the case of federal common law, it's up to the court to determine whether it is appropriate to fashion a rule of preclusion or to apply a federal rule of preclusion for the particular type of decision which is sought to be precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.655" offset="6979508">We would submit that, contrary to what Mr. Brogan says, that we should not forget that this is a civil rights action, and that in determining whether we should fashion a rule of preclusion we should look to Congress' intent in fashioning the Civil Rights Act in terms of how they expected a federal court to deal with an agency decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.949" offset="7076684">And in this case, certainly with respect to Title VII, Congress has spoken not once, not twice, but three times concerning the preclusive effects of agency decisions: First of all, in 1964 with the adoption of Title VII; then in 1972, when the amendments of Title VII were made; and then in a slightly different context, in the adoption of the Civil Rights Reform Act in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.051" offset="7201027">In each of those instances, what Congress did was indicate what its view was concerning the preclusive effect of state agency decisions or, more precisely, the right of claimants bringing civil rights actions to a de novo trial in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.543" offset="7271035">As this Court recognized in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver and Chandler versus Roudebush, the Congress enunciated certain principles concerning the rights of employees to bring cases in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.102" offset="7333311">First of all, the court... the Congress indicated that all employees, whether federal, state, or private, would be entitled to that trial de novo, regardless of what prior agency decision was utilized by that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.815" offset="7412096">Secondly, the Court has found and Congress has reiterated that individuals bringing civil rights actions under Title VII would be entitled to pursue independently rights under Title VII regardless of their rights under other applicable state and federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.718" offset="7495688">The Court has gone on to say that, for the purposes of Title VII, the federal courts have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.117" offset="7549291">That's the language that the Court recognized in Kremer, and the Court recognized that the dividing line between preclusion and non-preclusion in the context of a civil rights action was whether a claimant crossed the line between agency action and state court action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Ellis</label>
            <text syncTime="2237.382" offset="9082366">As I indicated, Congress did not stop with the Civil Rights Act in terms of indicating what should be the result when someone files a subsequent civil rights action when there is a prior agency decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.403" offset="9154463">In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978, although that's a different statutory scheme, the conference report and the Senate and House reports indicate quite clearly that the intent of Congress was to protect the rights of trial de novo which employees under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.538" offset="9238996">That statute provides for at least nine different times at which an employee may bring suit in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.072" offset="9277135">Included in that right to bring suit in federal court is a right to bring suit even after an employee has sought review in the EEOC and before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.202" offset="9329693">Congress indicated that an employee would still have the right to bring his individual employment discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.769" offset="9375982">In fact, the statute specifically distinguishes between individuals who claim only an adverse action and individuals who claim an adverse action pursuant to one of the anti-discrimination statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.318" offset="9426137">And while individuals who only claim an adverse action are entitled to a review in the Court of Appeals or the Court of Claims pursuant to an administrative procedure type proceeding, individuals who claim their adverse action also violates the anti-discrimination statutes are entitled to go into federal district court for a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.943" offset="9520596">I think the concerns of Congress in taking the federal courts available to claimants in civil rights cases is borne out by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.872" offset="9584335">What has happened is that the University of Tennessee as part of its employment decision has determined that Mr. Elliott should be disciplined and has gone into federal court and told the federal court that: we have determined what should happen to Mr. Elliott, and the federal court should not intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.586" offset="9667195">The decision of the administrative law judge is no more than the decision of an employee of the University of Tennessee, a recommendation to his own supervisor as to how the University should deal with Mr. Elliott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.868" offset="9732292">As such, it is not, as the University claims, somewhere down the line in terms of the agency action, the state action, but it is merely the beginning of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.037" offset="9780984">That is, only after the agency has affirmed the initial order is Mr. Elliott's employment in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.894" offset="9832393">That point was raised by the University in seeking to have Mr. Elliott's case originally transferred from the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.750" offset="9871890">When Mr. Elliott went into federal court and sought a temporary restraining order, the University of Tennessee went into federal court and said that: We have a decision that we can make in terms of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.478" offset="9926748">Mr. Elliott is not fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.581" offset="9935211">we haven't had our final decision on Mr. Elliott, and whatever action we take on Mr. Elliott will not be final until we have given him this administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.215" offset="9973768">So that the University in getting the case out of federal court urged the federal court that they had not finished with Mr. Elliott, and therefore the federal court should abstain from taking action until the University had made a final decision on Mr. Elliott's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.288" offset="10045970">Because the hearing examiner in this case was an employee of the University, the particular decision also should not be entitled to preclusive effect because Mr. Elliott should have been entitled to an impartial hearing by an external body.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.775" offset="10151923">Supposing, instead of going into federal court, you decided that after the administrative proceeding was over, but without seeking... first of all, do you agree that the review in the state court would have been on the record of the administrative proceeding and not de novo review?</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.639" offset="10303433">Well, the question I wanted to ask is, supposing after the termination of the administrative proceeding and without seeking review at all in the state court, you decided you had an independent common law or state statutory cause of action that you wanted to bring in a state court of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.830" offset="10364142">If you filed that kind of a lawsuit, would the administrative proceeding preclude the relitigation of issue in state court in Tennessee?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Ellis</label>
            <text syncTime="2566.406" offset="10398519">According to the Tennessee Administrative Procedure Act, the only way to review in state court the decision of an agency is through the chancery court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.306" offset="10446062">It is possible that that agency decision would be preclusive in the Tennessee state courts if it covered the same area that the agency decision covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.834" offset="10508233">And there was a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.276" offset="10513980">I think it's important to recognize that, despite the University's protestations to the contrary, that Mr. Elliott did not have an opportunity to raise his racial discrimination claims fully and fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.485" offset="10578764">He did attempt on many occasions throughout the hearing to present evidence which would have been relevant to claims of discrimination, not only to his own personal claim but to the claims that he had raised on behalf of the class and claims which he had raised against other defendants in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.621" offset="10667371">The hearing examiner took the position, first of all, that he had no jurisdiction to handle racial discrimination claims: and, even if he did, that he could not adjudicate questions that did not concern Mr. Elliott and the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.991" offset="10732782">Any other person, any other defendant, was not germane to the determination of the administrative law judge, and therefore he excluded evidence which Mr. Elliott tried to present concerning how other individuals were treated, other areas of discrimination by the University of Tennessee, and the ability of Mr. Elliott to function in the University of Tennessee as an extension agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.261" offset="10853886">As we indicate in our brief, there are a number of deficiencies in this particular agency decision, not the least of which is that this agency is not the kind of agency that we usually think of as an external body ruling on questions between two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.104" offset="10945314">Mr. Elliott did not receive an impartial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.529" offset="10962973">We believe that, regardless of what kind of rules might apply to agency decisions, such rules should not apply to the type of agency decisions in this particular cases; that despite the procedures that the Administrative Procedure Act provides in terms of the external trappings, that in fact the due process requirements are not satisfied because Mr. Elliott had not had an opportunity to have at least one impartial hearing on his claim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.543" offset="11119081">We believe that the failure to provide such an impartial hearing robs this particular agency decision of the ability to preclude Mr. Elliott from proceeding in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.018" offset="11204971">Mr. Elliott's counsel asked for, early in the proceedings, that the University provide an administrative law judge who was entirely unconnected with the University or the Extension Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.319" offset="11266098">The University was empowered to seek, through the secretary of state, to have someone from that office act in the capacity of administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.566" offset="11307162">The University failed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.987" offset="11316775">Instead, one of the the defendants in this case, Mr. Armistead, appointed one of his employees to act as fact finding and to recommend a decision to Mr. Armistead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.236" offset="11365781">The facts in this case are not that much different from the situation in Arnett versus Kennedy in terms of the question of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.067" offset="11437148">As Justice White mentioned in that case, and we agree:</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.330" offset="11466196">"No man should be a judge in his own cause. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.023" offset="11480929">And if the University of Tennessee, even if it had provided... even if the particular decision in this case would not on general principles, not be entitled to preclusion, on the specific facts of this case and on the specific content of this hearing, the rules of preclusion should not apply and Mr. Elliott should have been allowed to bring his particular employment discrimination case in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.385" offset="11610392">We think that the Sixth Circuit was right, that this Court's decision in Kremer indicates the proper dividing line, that the Sixth Circuit's rule should be affirmed and that agency decisions, regardless of their extent, regardless of how the state wants to characterize them or how the agency wants to characterize them, should not be entitled to preclusive effect, and that that result is the result that Congress wished when someone brought a civil rights action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Beauchamp E. Brogan</label>
            <text syncTime="2907.481" offset="11762842">Just one point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.393" offset="11770470">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.251" offset="11773918">With respect to whether Respondent received a full and fair hearing and an impartial hearing, I would like to point out that the Administrative Procedure Act prescribes the procedure whereby the claimant or the employee has rights to this full, plenary type due process hearing, which is similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.560" offset="11883110">Now, at no time, and I mean no time, did he ever object to the appointment of the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.085" offset="11917174">He could have done so, but he never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.557" offset="11927100">Instead, he deliberately, voluntarily litigated this issue of racial discrimination over a period of 28 days before this administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.893" offset="11972449">Now, if he thought he did not have a full and fair hearing, he could have taken that up immediately, either in the state chancery court or with some other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.482" offset="12014767">If a federal court is reviewing this question as to whether or not to apply the doctrine of preclusion in the first case, there is no question but what under the decisions of this Court the federal court can look to see whether the party received a full and fair opportunity to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.216" offset="12105778">And I'm pointing out that the record is devoid of any claim by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.619" offset="12131378">When he went back to the district court and when he went to the Court of Appeals, he never raised the issue that he did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate or that he did not receive a full and fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.388" offset="12186444">He did not seek a stay of the administrative agency judgment, which he had an absolute right to do under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.784" offset="12216015">He never did that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.407" offset="12222493">In broad terms, Mr. Brogan, is it not helpful to the whole system if administrative dispositions are encouraged?</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.412" offset="12270558">The problems may go away if they are free to take an administrative route first, without foreclosing judicial proceedings later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.203" offset="12325729">Well, we would like to think that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.425" offset="12338581">But apparently that's not always the case, if you read all the decisions that have worked its Way up to this Court: the Kremer case, the Allen case, the Migra case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.180" offset="12369615">And this case here is a splendid example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.451" offset="12378705">This man had a 28 day trial in the state court and he still wants another trial on those identical issues in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.526" offset="12410992">And we think that to have a law of non-preclusion, where a litigant can invoke a hearing to protect his liberty and property interests under the due process rights, which this Court says you have to afford him before you can take adverse personnel action against him, would work just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.691" offset="12507646">We're different from a private employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.142" offset="12517468">A private employer could have just gone ahead and terminated him, and then if he had proceeded through the EEOC scheme, it's true he could have been put back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.040" offset="12557069">But under this Court's decisions, the state is the victim, The state has no choice but to give him the hearing if he requests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.896" offset="12592491">So that we think that a rule of non-preclusion would encourage, rather than discourage, litigants from going into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.334" offset="12634183">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
