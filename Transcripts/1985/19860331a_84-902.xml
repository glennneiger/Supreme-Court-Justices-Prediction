            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="119738">Mr. Hansen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_d_hansen" startTime="98.195" stopTime="265.379">
            <label>Mr. Walter D. Hansen</label>
            <text syncTime="98.195" offset="512515">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="102.679" offset="530383">In the spring of 1983, Florida enacted and began collecting an unapportioned fuel tax on aviation fuel uplifted in Florida by Wardair, a Canadian airline, and by other foreign airlines, such fuel to be used exclusively in international commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.355" offset="637067">Wardair challenged the validity of that tax in a Florida circuit court on the grounds that it was unconstitutional and that it violated the terms of the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement between the United States and Canada, an agreement which regulates the foreign air transport services which Wardair can provide in and out of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.095" offset="744065">The circuit court held that the tax was constitutional, but that it did violate the terms of the bilateral agreement and issued an appropriate injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.450" offset="801534">On appeal, the case was certified to the Florida Supreme Court and that court again held the tax to be constitutional, but that it did not violate the terms of the bilateral agreement because there was no exemption from the payment of a state fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.579" offset="897978">That decision is at total odds with Japan Line against the County of Los Angeles in which this Court held that the California tax on cargo containers used exclusively in international commerce and owned by foreign nationals was unconstitutional even though there was no specific federal prohibition against the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.989" offset="1015634">The question in this case is identical to the question in the Japan Line decision, whether a state has the power to tax an instrument of foreign commerce owned by foreign nationals and used exclusively in international commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.950" offset="1099434">The Japan Line case is a pure one involving, as it does, solely the power over foreign commerce, an exclusive preserve of the federal government, with no parts shared with the individual states.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="265.379" offset="1181250">Well, Mr. Hansen, in Japan Line I think the Court at least expressed considerable concern, reliance upon the asymmetry that would exist, and here, I guess, Canada imposes a tax on fuel under the same circumstances that Florida does.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Walter D. Hansen</label>
            <text syncTime="286.355" offset="1265155">Yes, you are quite right, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.965" offset="1275500">But, it is my belief that that fact does not enter into this case as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.255" offset="1328685">What it does do is show--</text>

            <text syncTime="305.472" offset="1341537">But, certainly... It certainly cuts back on the reliance you can place on Japan Lines in my view.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.624" offset="1386154">What it does show, Justice O'Connor, is that if there is a method to remedy the problem that the United States may have with Canada as to this reciprocity, the federal government has to have the exclusive power to devise the remedy to suit the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.362" offset="1509139">It cannot be worried about what the individual states may do with that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.328" offset="1532962">It has to have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.859" offset="1539127">The federal government has to have the power to attempt to remedy and it is doing that right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.587" offset="1610076">--It is imposed by the provinces, just like Florida is imposing a tax here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.318" offset="1636930">I might suggest, however, that insofar as that problem is concerned, there are several things to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.814" offset="1678935">One, to my knowledge, there has not been a U.S. air carrier which has challenged that tax in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.950" offset="1723447">Two, there is presently a diplomatic initiative in an attempt to seek a remedy to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.509" offset="1765766">And, three, one of the United States air carriers that performs service to Canada has joined with other carriers in an amici brief supporting Wardair's case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.814" offset="1838909">In the Containers Corp. of America against the Franchise Tax Board, this Court commented on the Japan Line case, saying that it was consistent with international practice and expressed federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.053" offset="1947891">That case is a pure case involving the power of the federal government over foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.860" offset="1995121">And, this case is as pure.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.360" offset="2005152">It is Wardair's contention that the Japan Line decision should be considered here.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.533" offset="2137854">I do know that the provision in the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement shows that the countries are to provide these tax exemptions to the best possible way that the national law will provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.832" offset="2431052">But, that all is support for your basic argument that Japan Line controls as a matter of constitutional law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter D. Hansen</label>

            <text syncTime="584.329" offset="2456966">But, as I understand, you do not independently argue that the convention itself provides a federal reason for holding a state tax unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.997" offset="2499702">I missed it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_d_hansen" startTime="596.825" stopTime="1124.594">
            <label>Mr. Walter D. Hansen</label>
            <text syncTime="596.825" offset="2507016">There is no specific exemption from a state tax in the Chicago Convention or the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.789" offset="2546827">In Japan Line there were three elements which were essential to the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.174" offset="2600430">The subject taxed was owned by a foreign national.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.078" offset="2628016">It was used exclusively in international commerce and it was an instrument of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.512" offset="2661766">All three of those elements are met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.604" offset="2670125">Wardair is a foreign national.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.088" offset="2684022">The aviation fuel it uplifts out of Florida is used exclusively in international commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.285" offset="2728848">Wardair cannot provide any service other than foreign air transportation exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.065" offset="2751940">And, it is an instrument of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.016" offset="2763748">Now, an instrument of foreign commerce is no term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.001" offset="2775660">Means of commerce is another way of expressing it as shown by this Court in Helson against Kentucky where it found that fuel used to propel a transport vehicle was an instrument of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.242" offset="2848698">In Japan Line, the Court found that the cargo containers were instrument of foreign commerce as a matter of law based on the tax exemption provisions contained in Customs Convention on Containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.422" offset="2921423">In that convention for cargo containers used exclusively in international commerce the convention provided an exemption from national import duties and national import taxes and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.181" offset="2996447">It did not exempt from any state taxes, yet this Court held the California tax to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.740" offset="3026644">In this case, both the Chicago Convention and the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement provide tax exemptions almost exactly the same as those contained in the Customs Convention on Containers plus other state exemptions for aviation fuel uplifted... I am sorry, used exclusively in international commerce and cover fuel which is uplifted in the territory of one country by the carrier of another, thus Wardair's aviation fuel uplifts in Florida are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.815" offset="3222980">Now, the Court in Japan Line showed that it was not important whether the exemption granted an exemption from state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.885" offset="3295183">What it did show is what it demonstrates, what the tax exemption demonstrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.413" offset="3321305">And, the Court reasoned that the tax exemption provision evidenced a desirability for a uniform federal regulation of containers used exclusively in international commerce and reflected a federal policy to remove all impediments as to their use as instruments of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.979" offset="3443558">It was on that basis that the Court held that since the California tax frustrated the attainment of that federal regulatory uniformity, it was inconsistent with the power of Congress over foreign commerce and, therefore, unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.454" offset="3537495">That same reasoning and that same ultimate conclusion is as applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.154" offset="3568319">Florida's tax on Wardair's fuel was unconstitutional because it was a serious infringement on the power of Congress over foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.180" offset="3620355">There is another element here that is not contained in the Japan Line case that bolsters the case against the Florida fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.237" offset="3676675">Congress has expressed a clear mandate through the Federal Aviation Act requiring the uniform federal regulation of foreign air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.732" offset="3722651">Even though Congress deregulated domestic air transportation almost eight years ago, the federal government still regulates on a highly structured basis through the Federal Aviation Act all foreign air transportation and the reason is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.880" offset="3807183">United States air carrier participation in foreign air transportation is totally dependent upon the ability of the federal government to operate effectively in regulating foreign air transportation with foreign governments and reaching adequate international regulatory agreements or understandings based on reciprocity and comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.134" offset="3920241">The uniform federal regulation of foreign air transportation by the federal government is absolutely essential if that national interest purpose is to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.533" offset="4001847">By Section 1102 of the Federal Aviation Act, Congress enacted a set of goals to be met through the International Regulatory Agreement signed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.574" offset="4053988">Those goals include the reduction of discrimination and the increased competition opportunities by the United States air carriers in foreign air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.630" offset="4118249">Any unilateral state action which may disrupt the regulatory balance as to foreign air transportation reached by the International Regulatory Agreements signed by the United States would either impair or thwart the achievement of those statutory goals set by Congress and thereby infringe on Congress' power over foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.894" offset="4291284">There is one other aspect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.843" offset="4323049">If there is proliferation of any such interferences by states such as Florida's tax on Wardair's fuel, in the words of this Court in Japan Line, would make speaking with one voice impossible, yet if the Florida Supreme Court is not reversed here, such a proliferation will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.251" offset="4452721">The amici brief supporting Florida in this case makes that fact known very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.060" offset="4491905">Now, this case concerns solely the power of the federal government to regulate foreign air transportation in concert with its foreign government partners and to devise such remedies as the national interests warrant when there are disagreements with those partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.330" offset="4609038">This power over foreign commerce--</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.559" offset="8109968">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.136" offset="8136195">The question presented in this case is whether the excise tax, which is a sales tax, imposed by Florida upon the privilege of engaging in the business of selling tangible personal property, which in this case includes aviation fuel, unconstitutionally impairs the power of the federal government to regulate foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.720" offset="8222608">The case is a narrow constitutional challenge to the exercise of this fundamental state power, the power to tax, the power to tax purchases of goods in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.934" offset="8283421">The challenge by the Appellant rests on two grounds and those two grounds are set forth in the Japan Line case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.927" offset="8355415">In that case this Court said when you are looking to taxes that affected foreign commerce there were two additional tests beyond that in the Complete Auto case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.672" offset="8402331">There were four of them in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.141" offset="8408287">In this case, the tax unquestionably passes the four-prong test in Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.030" offset="8439842">We are left with two in Japan Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.372" offset="8449142">The first in Japan Line was the risk of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.244" offset="8468682">The parties in this case concede there are no such risks of multiple taxation in this case unlike in Japan Line where there was an ad valorem tax on a container and that container could be taxed somewhere else and in that case in Japan... In fact, was taxed in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.706" offset="8542556">In this case, we have an excise tax or sales tax upon the privilege of doing business in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.578" offset="8570037">That incident can only be taxed once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.592" offset="8586024">The second ground in Japan Line and the ground that the Appellant relies on is that it prevents the United States from speaking with one voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.478" offset="8637642">And, it is the Appellant's position that there are two grounds for finding a violation of this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.256" offset="8664705">The first ground was that the tax, the sales tax involved in this case was pre-empted by federal legislation and the international agreements or the executive agreements involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.361" offset="8717158">And, the second ground was that the state excise tax impermissibly intrudes upon the federal government's power over foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.434" offset="8761462">On the first issue of pre-emption, they claim that under the Federal Aviation Act that the Congress has pre-empted this entire area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.617" offset="8806184">I would submit to the Court that there is nothing contained in any of the provisions they cite that pre-empts the state from imposing an otherwise valid sales tax, in fact, such as before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.737" offset="8858638">And, in fact, Section 1513(b) evidences Congress' intend to preserve that source of income to the State of Florida, in other words, sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.542" offset="8925825">And, that section, as this Court found in the Aloha case, Congress preserved that right or reserved that right to the states, whereas in subsection (a) of that section it prohibited or preempted certain state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.302" offset="8992907">So, now we are down to the international agreements, or in this particular case, one international agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.611" offset="9026135">The question when you look at the international agreement is what is the one voice that the federal government has spoken in these agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.825" offset="9066990">I would submit that in those agreements what the federal government has done is reserve its sovereign right to allow the states to tax as they please as long as the tax is not discriminatory in this area of sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.053" offset="9139924">The agreement itself speaks only to national excise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.129" offset="9160195">The Convention of 1944 speaks only of national and local taxes on fuel brought into the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.624" offset="9198229">The resolution that was mentioned by the Appellant that was done in 1966, while it speaks to state taxes or taxes on a local level, this resolution, I submit, has never been incorporated into this agreement or any other of the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.320" offset="9277015">In fact, the United States has reserved its sovereign power in this area in these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.988" offset="9311601">Some of the other agreements mentioned by the various amicus in this case, some of the newer agreements after 1978, use the term "best efforts" and this begs the question, if the United States in these agreements, other agreements involved in this case, are saying they will use their best efforts, it is an admission that the agreements don't cover this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.071" offset="9412016">It is an admission that the federal government has reserved its sovereign power in this area to allow the states to tax as they please as long as it is not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.318" offset="9449005">So, the federal policy is not there.</text>
