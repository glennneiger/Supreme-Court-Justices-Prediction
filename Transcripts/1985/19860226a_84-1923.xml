            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="19.128" offset="219922">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents important questions of subject matter jurisdiction of a Federal District Court in cases arising under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.769" offset="270495">Congress granted its consent to such suits when it enacted Section 405(g) of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.106" offset="295781">But Congress imposed two specific restrictions on that waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.862" offset="322844">First, Congress has provided that judicial review is available only after</text>
            <text syncTime="48.581" offset="337682">"the Secretary's final decision, after a hearing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="53.033" offset="355549">And secondly, judicial review is available only if the individual commences an action within 60 days after the mailing to him of the notice of the final decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.077" offset="423677">This Court has repeatedly made clear in Yamasaki and Diaz and Salfi that in order for a person to be include as a member of a class, he must individually satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.654" offset="478011">In other words, in order to be included in the class, he has to have been to file his own individual suit when the suit was filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="507373">The Courts of Appeals in this case completely disregard these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.212" offset="524196">Respondents brought this suit to challenge the manner in which evidence of mental impairment was being evaluated by the New York State Agency under several regulation issued by the Secretary to implement the statutory definition of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="584277">Any member of the class in this case who disagreed with a state agency's decision that he was able to work and therefore was not disabled within the meaning of the Act was free to take an administrative appeal to the ALJ, to the appeals Counsel, and then to seek judicial review in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.516" offset="653450">In fact, in this case seven of the eight individuals who are claimants in this case did go to the ALJ stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.170" offset="684065">Several of those were awarded benefits by the ALJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.657" offset="702037">Others were denied benefits on grounds unrelated to the policy of which the claimants object in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.460" offset="733175">Although the thousands of unnamed class members in this case were explicitly informed that they, too, had a right to seek further review, including going to the ALJ and appeals counsel, they declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="786047">When they declined to seek review in 60 days, their decisions became final and binding against them, and they therefore accepted the consequence that those decisions were in effect res judicata.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.878" offset="830873">Well, Mr. Kneedler, I guess the problem is that the District Court founds that the Secretary's policy involved in this case was a covert one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.926" offset="4735135">Yes, at every stage of the administrative process there is a 60-day time limit, and the claimant is specifically told that, and at most of the levels of administrative review, particularly after the reconsideration, before the ALJ level, he is told that he can call up a phone number at SSA and ask for more information if he wants to, if he thinks that he needs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.940" offset="4811099">The problem in this case is that the rationale of the Court of Appeals is not premised on the existence of a secret policy in the sense that there was affirmative concealment of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.984" offset="4883301">The District Court's premise of tolling in this case on the 60-day filing was that as long as the Secretary's approach or the state agency's approach to this remained undisclosed, that the 60-day time limit would run apparently for as long as the policy remained undisclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.996" offset="4951324">If this had been adopted in 1976 and came to light in 1982, under the Court of Appeals rationale, there is no reason why those old claims could not be reopened, and this, it seems to us, is fundamentally inconsistent with the explicit judgment of Congress in Section 405(g) recognized by this Court in Califano versus Sanders, that a claimant has only 60 days within which to seek further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.996" offset="5059366">Also, it is important to keep in mind here the role that Section 5 of the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 plays in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.488" offset="5109313">When it enacted Section 5, Congress specifically focused on the question of mental impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.092" offset="5131778">It specifically focused, and I would like to read the House report to you, that serious questions have been raised by federal courts, professionals in the field of psychiatry and vocational counseling and GAO about the adequacy of SSA's listing of mental impairment and the appropriateness of SSA's current methods of assessing residual functional capacity and predicating ability to work in individuals with mental impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.421" offset="5225087">That is the precise issue raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.190" offset="5236163">What Congress did when it enacted Section 5 of the 1984 Act was to extend a moratorium the Secretary had previously adopted to direct her to finish something that she had undertaken on her own, which was to reexamine the criteria for evaluating mental impairments and to reevaluate the listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.203" offset="5320173">And even before this suit was filed, the Secretary had undertaken those measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.623" offset="5345877">Then what Congress did not provide a remedy for people who might have been wrongfully denied benefits under the prior approach, it said that any claimant whose claim was denied after March 1 of 1981 could reapply for benefits and have his claim reexamined under the new standards the Secretary promulgated, which were finally promulgated last August.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.937" offset="5431141">So any class member in this case whose claim was denied after March 1, 1981, which was as far back as Congress chose to go, can reapply for benefits under the special regime that Congress established for dealing with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.880" offset="5486939">Congress did not, however, provide for the reopening of the past decisions in which those claims were originally denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.952" offset="5527167">Congress, in order to do that, it would be necessary for a court to excuse the failure of class members to seek further review within 60 days and to exhaust their remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.694" offset="5570113">Congress knew how to do that, too, when it wanted to do so, when it wanted to excuse claimants from their failure to comply with the rules, because in Section 2 of the 1984 Act, Congress took class actions as they were then existing when it enacted that Act on the medical improvement question and said all such class members can be sent to the Secretary to have their claims reevaluated, whether or not they satisfied the 60-day rule or the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.311" offset="5680663">So Congress looked at that problem and took that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.815" offset="5698635">It did not take that approach under Section 5 of the 1984 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.998" offset="6007402">It granted relief where there was already a class action pending, and I think in these circumstances before the Court should adopt an approach to the jurisdictional requirements under 405(g) that is potentially openhanded and gives rise to a hydraulic pressure to dispense with the necessary rules, it should have a pretty compelling reason to do so, and the fact that Congress has stepped in and addressed what it perceived was perhaps a systemic problem I think makes it unnecessary for the Court to have to fashion, judicially fashion rules of exhaustion or 60 days here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.621" offset="6153897">I think we are entitled to take Congress at its word in doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.508" offset="6177407">As I say, the Court of Appeals rationale was simply that what the state agency decisionmakers did was not affirmatively disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.631" offset="6209904">Well, something is supposed to be affirmatively disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.866" offset="6222860">The rule would be to require publication of it, or to seek review and to say that in the review process the agency can't rely on something that previously hadn't been published, but the motion that something contained in a memorandum that is not published in the Federal Register excuses somebody from complying with the fair and simple procedural rules that govern this program is really quite an openhanded principle, and we think it would really lead to havoc in the administration of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.287" offset="6356503">By the same token, the Court of Appeals' approach to the exhaustion question was not at all dependent upon the motion of a secret policy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.093" offset="6387745">The Court of Appeals adopted what it called an ad hoc balancing approach to the question of exhaustion rather than adhering to the strict final decision requirement where judicial review is available only after a hearing, which suggests that everything that would be resolved in a hearing has to be resolved before judicial review is there, and the only exception this Court has recognized to that was in the case... was in Matthews versus Eldridge, which precisely fits the three-part test for the Cohen doctrine for the collateral order doctrine under 1291 which uses the same final decision language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.983" offset="6527344">We have a very... from this Court's decisions and what Congress has said, a very precise jurisdictional regime that is fair and reasonable for the claimants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.864" offset="6606860">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what happened here in the Social Security Administration was highly disturbing, as was found by the courts below in a series of detailed findings which the government did not challenge on appeal and did not raise in their cert petition to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.441" offset="6681153">The question for this Court, however, is whether relief can be awarded responsive to conduct unbefitting an agency of the United States without opening the door to an excessive or premature use of the courts in derogation of the usually appropriate administrative scheme of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.922" offset="6763073">And so I want to start by describing a very narrow Rule where full exhaustion is excused, a rule that arises from what one hopes are the unique or at least truly extraordinary circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.598" offset="6825766">Then I want to show why this narrow exception fits directly within what this Court has said, particularly in Eldridge and Ringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.604" offset="6857845">The principle test of waiver of exhaustion suggested by this case is indeed narrow because the circumstances are so unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.426" offset="6893058">Let me try and lay the test out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.112" offset="6903820">Where the government by use of a pervasive procedural practice which is secret, which is in flat derogation of regulations or a general rule per the comment of Mr. Justice Stevens, which functions to deprive a class of claimants of the right guaranteed by statute to a meaningful first level evaluation and where further administrative review cannot possibly give you the lawful first level process which you were denied, then further administrative review is excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.739" offset="7066302">Debate is possible on whether each of those elements is indeed absolutely necessary, but all of those elements were found to be the fact by the judge below and by Judge Larson in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.814" offset="7134638">Let me make clear what we do not suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.035" offset="7151566">It is obviously not enough for a claimant to argue that the initial decisionmaker made a legal or factual mistake in the claimant's particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.476" offset="7197332">In such circumstances, there is no collateral right to assert because the statute and the regulations here obviously do not contemplate that the initial decisionmaking process be error free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.336" offset="7260757">Individual mistakes are precisely what administrative reviews are designed to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.489" offset="7285313">A fair and meaningful decisionmaking process, not a perfect one, is what is expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.362" offset="7316868">We also are not saying that an erroneous general interpretation of the law is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.849" offset="7346753">Rather, what we are saying is that where there has been a pervasive subverting of the legal process itself, further exhaustion was not required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.503" offset="7673388">Here we have a flat contradiction of the regulation in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.857" offset="7698779">The regulation called for there being a separate process after Step 3 to assess by a medical person whether the claimant had or did not have residual functional capacity, and they simply passed a per se rule or adopted secretly a per se rule that truncated the process and eliminated Steps 4 and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.439" offset="7797104">In addition, the regulations called for medical professionals to make those judgments with respect to RFC, and as the findings in this case demonstrate, the views of the medical professionals were just plain disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.415" offset="7861051">So in those two respects our case is different than the one you posed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.069" offset="7879651">Now, our primarily collateral claim is, and the unchallenged finding of fact was that the initial decisionmaking process had been made a meaningless and unfair hurdle instead of an opportunity for an objective review of the medical facts by medical professionals, and the regulation, as I said, stated quite flatly that where the impairment was severe, as it was in this case for all class members, but they didn't meet the listings, there should be an RFC evaluation by doctors, and that simply was not done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.589" offset="8109737">Moreover, Judge Larsen... the Minnesota case was a little bit ahead of this case, and in that case, Judge Larsen in his opinion granting attorneys' fees against the government on the ground that their defense of fact had been fundamentally unreasonable, found that they had said in the Minnesota case that they had lied in the Minnesota case.</text>

I would like to change the facts a little bit, and suppose the Secretary had simply announced publicly that claimants would not get a complete evaluation pursuant to what the regulations require at the initial decisionmaking stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.874" offset="8430834">Suppose the announcement said claimants have to go through a truncated process at the first stage in violation of the regulations in order to get a full and fair hearing, but only to get that in compliance with the regulations if they appealed them to the ALJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.435" offset="8501156">I say rhetorically would that not be a fit case for exhaustion, for waiver of exhaustion, but what was done here was worse, and even more clearly a case for exhaustion, because again as the District Court found, the violation of the regulation and the consequent deprivation of the right to a meaningful initial hearing was undisclosed to the claimants and the ALJ's, so it couldn't be corrected in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.557" offset="8629574">As the ABA stresses in their quotation from some baseball figure in their amicus brief, this deprivation, this particular deprivation could not be cured in the administrative process because you can't hit what you can't see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.951" offset="8707210">Not only were claimants secretly denied their right to a meaningful initial hearing in compliance with the regulations, but in addition what was done at the initial stage was found by Judge Weinstein based upon admissions by the government, by the way, to have tainted the record at the ALJ stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.050" offset="8803549">The ALJ's were instructed by regulation to give weight to the RFC findings by the medical professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.439" offset="8841166">The record before the ALJ's purported to contain such findings but of course we now know those findings were not made, and as the deputy chief ALJ testified at the trial, admitted at the trial, had they known the truth, they would have given no weight to the RFC findings in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.238" offset="8928310">We have a second collateral claim which is perhaps less important, and I will be briefer on it, the first one being the deprivation of the right given by Congress to a meaningful initial stage hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.579" offset="8973659">The second collateral claim is derivative of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.780" offset="8990482">In violation of the statute and the Secretary's regulations, the claimants were not told the real basis why the initial decisionmakers denied their benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.705" offset="9042204">This was in flat... I would here like to use what was said in Mr. Justice Powell's opinion in Eldridge when he got to the merits about the assumptions on how the Social Security review system was meant to work, and what was done here by the government, by the Social Security Administration, was in flat contradiction to what the government had represented about the administrative review system in Eldridge, and I urge you to review what is said in Eldridge at the bottom of Page 345 and the top of Page 346.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.911" offset="9175011">I cannot pause to read it all, but the heart of the matter on our second collateral issue was that the agency was expected to give its full reasoning and a summary of the most relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.752" offset="9230390">Why was that to be done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.537" offset="9237495">Well, it was stated in your Eldridge opinion why it was meant to be done, and now quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.575" offset="9257662">It was done</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.475" offset="9261319">"to enable the recipient, the claimant, to mold his argument to respond to the precise issues which the decisionmaker regards as crucial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.965" offset="9311265">Now, here no such thing was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.267" offset="9320460">And thus a collateral right to a fair process was in this second way a fair process in compliance with the statute and in compliance with the regulations and in compliance with what this Court said it expected was denied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.212" offset="9388274">Let me turn in more detail perhaps to Eldridge and Ringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.348" offset="9400813">I submit that this is, if anything, a stronger case for waiver of full exhaustion than was Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.252" offset="9432369">There the claim was that a due process hearing was required before disability benefits could be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.291" offset="9468522">In concluding that exhaustion after initial presentment of the claim was not required, this Court said that it would be "unrealistic" to expect the Secretary... by that it means the regular administrative review process... to change the challenged procedure or practice at the behest of a single aid recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.891" offset="9566952">Under our facts, it was not simply unrealistic, but rather it was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.347" offset="9600806">Neither the claimants nor their advisors nor the subsequent levels of administrative review such as the ALJ's knew of the challenged practice which deprived claimants of a meaningful and lawful first stage analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.157" offset="9667993">Similarly, here precisely as in Eldridge the nature of the issue is such that whatever happened in subsequent stages of administrative review, even if we could have been able to bring it up, even if we had known the facts, whatever happened in subsequent stages of administrative review could not give the claimant the procedural right that had been denied to him or her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.959" offset="9779171">In summary, on Ringer, although I am going to come back to it in more detail, this is a very different case than Ringer, among other reasons because this is not at bottom... your words in that opinion... a claim for benefits, and also because what was done in Ringer was done by the Secretary within the area of appropriate discretion, of appropriate administrative discretion, but I submit there is no discretion, there is no appropriate discretion for a government agency to issue a regulation promising to act in one way and then to break that promise and to do so secretly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.905" offset="9962968">In Eldridge, in your opinion in Eldridge, the single most important factor is that the claim be collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.061" offset="9995673">Eldridge's claim was characterized by this Court as entirely collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.364" offset="10016885">The general principle in Footnote 11, which sets out the general principle, the Court said that the core principle of the exhaustion rule is that if possible finality requirements should be construed so that crucial collateral claims not be lost and potentially irreparable injuries suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.580" offset="10109672">The claims in this case are collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.232" offset="10120330">They are crucial collateral claims, and if it were necessary to show that they are entirely collateral, which I believe it is not, but if it were necessary, the claims in this case when properly described are entirely collateral.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.336" offset="10260764">Let me say why we are interested in the case, why we joined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.938" offset="10279154">I suppose most poignantly is the finding that was made by Judge Weinstein that 40 percent of the homeless people who are now sleeping on the streets of New York, increasingly making our city look like Calcutta, are people who were terminate from the... mentally disturbed persons with severe mental disabilities who were terminated by the Social Security Administration per this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.971" offset="10379255">So, we have an interest in stopping this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.440" offset="10397123">Now, we also have a fiscal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.592" offset="10405796">If the judgment here is affirmed, the claimants... by the way, they don't automatically get benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.396" offset="10432963">they have to still establish the right under a fair proceeding without the tilting of the balance that was improperly and secretly put in by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.171" offset="10480088">If they prevail, we will be entitled to some portion of the back benefits that they receive to the extent that the city or the state made good our obligation to care for the needy, which calls for us to spend less money, and it is far less adequate than the federal benefits under the Social Security Administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.904" offset="10586981">That, of course, would remain to be decided by the District Court as a matter of the remedial details of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.262" offset="10632434">And I don't think... there has been no decision to that effect, Justice Blackmun, but I think we would have a claim upon those moneys, and the claimants would have a claim on the residue, the amount that is greater than the moneys which were reimbursed to the claimants by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.461" offset="10721251">But as I say, that has not been resolved in a case, and first and foremost, our interest is that our people not be thrown out of a government program and as was found by Judge Weinstein thrown out on the streets to their detriment and to the general population's detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.541" offset="10813515">Now, I was saying that if we had to, and I don't think we do, but if we had to, I believe we can show properly construed, properly understood, properly articulate that the claim in this case is entirely collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.300" offset="10872552">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.269" offset="10876418">Because the result of the Secretary's actions here was to deny altogether the claimant's right to a fair or meaningful assessment of their claims at the initial evaluation stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.844" offset="10930753">Seeking to vindicate this right was or is in the relevant sense entirely collateral to their claim for benefits, and as in Eldridge, precisely as in Eldridge, this right could not be vindicated by subsequent layers of administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.990" offset="11007344">Eldridge also calls upon the Court to consider the "consequences" of deferred administrative review or similarly</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.029" offset="11047468">"claimant's interest in having a particular issue resolved promptly. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.017" offset="11067425">That has to be looked at along with collaterality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.869" offset="11078815">Here, just as in Eldridge, to defer is to deny the right which we seek to vindicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.489" offset="11105355">To force claimants to a second stage hearing before they receive their first fair evaluation in compliance with the regulations is to deny forever the right they sought to vindicate in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.615" offset="11165855">It was enough for Mr. Eldridge that he made a colorable claim that an erroneous termination would damage him in a way not recompensable through retroactive payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.725" offset="11218308">Here again, if anything, our case is stronger on the point than was Eldridge's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.612" offset="11241819">The harm here is not just a claim of damage or a colorable assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.866" offset="11266896">Here there were explicit actual uncontested findings that this class of mentally disturbed claimants was devastating, some even becoming suicidal, some indeed committing suicide by the improper denials, and there were uncontested findings that because of their condition, their mentally disturbed condition, they were particularly likely to be deterred from pursuing their claim further through the administrative appeal process by the crushing news of the denial, and of course if they did pursue it further, as Judge Weinstein found, even though some of them would win, there was nonetheless a taint to the record that went to the ALJ's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.529" offset="11449544">To insist on exhaustion here would not only be inconsistent in principle with the legal claims we raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.952" offset="11491236">It would also in practice insulate from any remedy a policy that caused real injuries to thousands of mentally ill persons, and none of the benefits that can be achieved from exhaustion as defined in Salfi, as earlier articulated in McCart, could have been achieved in this case through further exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.598" offset="11581724">So, with no benefits from exhaustion, with substantial and irreparable injury from exhaustion, and with a crucial collateral issue, we squarely fit the Eldridge standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.589" offset="11629789">And nothing which you said in Ringer changes this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.560" offset="11649642">First, Ringer was recognized as being at bottom a claim for benefits, and that is laid out at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.014" offset="11679422">But here, another point about Ringer and the issues, the holding by the Secretary there or the statement by the Secretary that BCBR surgery was not reimbursable is a kind of matter which, as this Court said, is clearly discretionary clearly within the discretion of the Secretary to decide whether a particular medical procedure is reasonable and necessary under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.002" offset="11803347">It is not within the discretion of the Secretary or any other government official to secretly violate their own regulations and deprive people of their rights in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.926" offset="11855069">It is not normal and within the administrative power to say that claimants will not be given a meaningful first stage evaluation, and to do so secretly, and I stress again that in Ringer it was an appropriate medical judgment that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.137" offset="11923928">Here, the medical judgment had been made in the regulations as to what has happened, meant to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.108" offset="11947856">There were meant to be five stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.677" offset="11954126">They truncated it after three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.493" offset="11961335">Who was to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.395" offset="11964993">The doctors were to evaluate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.179" offset="11972098">They ignored the opinions of the doctors as found repeatedly by Judge Weinstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.901" offset="12006997">It is perhaps helpful again for me to compare... to illustrate the extent of the government's misconduct and its departure from both the letter and the spirit of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.126" offset="12055899">I would like again to illustrate that by comparing what was found to have been actually done in this case with what this Court assumed was the practice in your Richardson v. Perales opinion, and in your Eldridge opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.170" offset="12120055">In Richardson, it was stated, in holding that the written report of doctors could be relied upon in these kinds of hearings, it was stated that disabilities decisions turn on, quoting from your opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.030" offset="12179510">"routine standard and unbiased medical reports of physician specialists. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.715" offset="12198214">The same quote was repeated when you got to the merits in Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.734" offset="12214305">But here, in contrast to that expectation, and as found by the District Court, the professional opinions of physicians that claimants could not work were consistently overridden and disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.909" offset="12266968">There is a lot more both in Richardson to a great extent and in Eldridge also describing how this system is meant to work, which is utterly disregarded by what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.501" offset="12309391">It is meant to be nonadversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.901" offset="12315033">It is meant to be open all fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.969" offset="12323288">It is not meant to be something where a secret rule is imposed in violation of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.157" offset="12348052">The government tries here to reargue the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.492" offset="12361322">The first point is that these are curious arguments to make in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.711" offset="12378250">The District Court found that the policy was secret, was illegal, was uniformly imposed, was not discovered until after this case was brought, and it was imposed upon physicians whose professional judgment differed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.020" offset="12431435">The District Court found that this was imposed by high level officials of the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.957" offset="12455259">The government chose not to appeal a single one of those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.209" offset="12472186">They were confirmed by the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.074" offset="12583677">And again, the opinion by Judge Larsen on attorneys' fees which we mentioned is relevant, is hopeful, is helpful, is showing that the defense on the merits tried in the District Courts was not in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.785" offset="12650550">That is why he awarded attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.220" offset="12664238">On 60 days... let me just give the briefest of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.872" offset="12682837">I rely on our brief for the point that this is a statute of limitations as this Court has twice before said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.978" offset="12715334">I rely on the brief for the point that even if this is jurisdictional, the time never started to run because the true reasons for the decision were not given to the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.853" offset="12774788">If we win on exhaustion, it doesn't make sense, I submit, to go against us on 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.574" offset="12801642">The same bad faith, the same clandestine policy which excuses, which contributes to the excusing of the further administrative review causes this statute to be told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.432" offset="12857126">Now, there is a lot of discussion... Justice Rehnquist, you made the point about when the government is involved, shouldn't you turn square corners?</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.190" offset="12896101">True.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.411" offset="12932986">Tolling, as was argued, for example, in Soriano, for war is something which the Court in Soriano quite correctly said you do not assume, particularly against the government unless it has been specifically included in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.871" offset="12998919">But tolling for misconduct of the sort that was involved here is something which the general statements of this Court starting in 1874 in Bailey against Glover say is, under the common law of England and the United States is assumed, and which this Court in 1947 in Homeburg, quoting Bailey against Glover, said that this equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.011" offset="13443419">They say the sky will fall if you affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.696" offset="13454181">They say the consequences to the vast Social Security Administration will be harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.250" offset="13480408">Well, it won't unless the government is reserving the right to once again systematically and secretly ignore their own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.590" offset="13513740">Actually, I am glad they raised the subject, because the consequence of accepting the government's position, will be to flood the administrative system with more cases, and to flood the courts with more cases, because if the rule, as the government argues, is that they can secretly violate someone's rights, and then the person who didn't know what was done to them has lost their chance to go to court, well, everybody... it would be malpractice for lawyers not always to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.259" offset="13636411">They would go to court, like Mr. Macawber, hoping that something will turn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.161" offset="13648010">So, they have the consequences upside-down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.313" offset="13660653">Finally, on Congressional intent, the government speaks passionately about Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.969" offset="13687298">Of course, that begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.952" offset="13695239">Here, as in Eldridge, the issue at bottom is what is that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.539" offset="13717495">Let me ask the question rhetorically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.858" offset="13730766">Why would Congress want to require a vulnerable class of mentally impaired persons to have to take further administrative appeals when those appeals could not possibly right the systematic wrong, the systemic wrong that had been done to them?</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.431" offset="13869110">Here the District Court did not even reach the question of whether the APA required these internal memoranda to be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.268" offset="13896486">There has been no finding that the statute was violated by not giving more complete decisions, explanations of the decisions to include this particular approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.107" offset="13927833">Respondents raise that issue for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.809" offset="13942671">Third, the named plaintiffs in this case all... seven of the eight all went to the ALJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.379" offset="13964927">They were not deterred or misled by the government from seeking further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.115" offset="13979869">And fourth, the unnamed claimants, none of them invoked the procedure Congress has set out for extending the time limit when equity warrants it.</text>
