            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="30.128" offset="272247">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="33.877" offset="287189">The issue in this case is whether members of an institutional Disciplinary Committee who are responsible for adjudicating charges that federal inmates have committed violations of prison rules may be sued for damages by inmates who were dissatisfied with the results of these disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.275" offset="380812">Now, this is a somewhat narrow legal issue in some respects but it is of extreme practical importance to the Bureau of Prisons and the operation of the federal prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.490" offset="425638">There are more than 30,000 of these IDC hearings held each year in the federal prison system, and this Court has noted on a number of occasions that the maintenance of good order within these institutions is central to the accomplishment of all other correctional goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.325" offset="509021">Therefore, it is essential that the disciplinary process work correctly and that these IDC hearings reached the right results in the cases that are brought before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.383" offset="549249">Any extraneous factor that threatens to skew the results of these hearings is therefore a very important and serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.349" offset="585089">We believe, for reasons that we hope to explain, that the threat that disciplinary committee members might be sued for damages in their personal capacity on the basis of their service on these committees, to do just that would skew the results of these hearings and therefore would weaken prison discipline and security, and for that reason we have sought certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.245" offset="684668">The facts here can be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.822" offset="698983">In January 1975 there was a two-day strike by inmates at the Terre Haute prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.054" offset="723956">A few weeks later the respondents in this case, Saxner and Cain who were inmates at Terre Haute, were charged with encouraging prisoners to engage in another work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.330" offset="773066">These charges were heard before prison IDC on February 21, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.155" offset="800338">Members of the IDC that day, unfortunately for them, were the three petitioners in this case, Cleavinger, Marcadis and Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.761" offset="838790">After hearing testimony and looking at the documentary evidence, the IDC found respondents guilty of encouraging this work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.804" offset="874944">In addition, based on the evidence that had been introduced at the hearing, the IDC found the respondents had also committed another violation of prison rules, possession of contraband, on the basis of certain materials advocating the formation of a prisoners' labor union that had been found in their cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.295" offset="952893">The Discipline Committee ordered that respondents be placed in administrative segregation and that they forfeit some of their good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.995" offset="983718">Saxner and Cain appealed this decision to the prison warden, who gave them virtually all of the relief that they had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.993" offset="1015692">He ordered their release from administrative segregation, and he ordered that the forfeited good time be restored to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.177" offset="1040456">The warder refused to expunge respondents' records, and so they therefore took the next step in the administrative appeals process by appealing to the Regional Director of the Bureau of Prisons who in April 1975 gave them the rest of the relief that they had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.687" offset="1102418">He ordered that their records be expunged.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.950" offset="1115479">Respondents were still not satisfied, so they brought this Bivens action against the three members of their Discipline Committee, alleging that petitioners and other prison employees had violated their rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.491" offset="1181726">The only charge that is relevant here is the Fifth Amendment claim because the jury found after trial that petitioners had violated respondents' due process rights at the IDC hearing by finding them guilty of a charge, the possession of contraband charge, of which they had not received 24 hours' advance notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.186" offset="1260511">The jury awarded $5,000 for this due process violation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="381.253" offset="1676694">The framework, we think, for analyzing the absolute immunity issue in this case is rather clear in light of this Court's prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.813" offset="1710967">In Butz against Economou the Court held that most Executive Branch officials charged with constitutional violations enjoy only a qualified immunity from damages liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.091" offset="1752031">The Court held that there are certain government officials whose special functions require a full exemption from damages liability in the public interest, and in a number of cases since Butz the Court has wrestled with the question, whether this particular function or that required a full exemption from damages, liability, prosecutors or witnesses in judicial proceedings, or the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.345" offset="1857148">But this case, we think, is quite different from all of these previous cases in a rather fundamental way, and that's because this Court has already held in cases stretching back more than a century that one function of government that does require a full exemption from damages liability in the public interest is the adjudicatory function, and the Court has also held in many cases that even Executive Branch officials who don't hold the rank or title or Judge, such as Administrative Hearing Officers, are nonetheless entitled to quasi-judicial immunity if what they're engaged in are adjudicatory functions that are comparable to that of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.735" offset="2022660">The test that we think emerges from these cases, principally Butz against Economou, is the following: a government official is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity if, first, his role is functionally comparable to that of a judge; second, the controversies that he resolves are such as to lead to harassing or retaliatory litigation that would chill the proper performance of those adjudicatory duties; and finally, that the adjudicatory system contains other safeguards to avoid or correct constitutional violations if they should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.345" offset="2165079">We think that if that test is applied to this case, the result that follows inevitably is that Executive officials whose job it is to adjudicate prison disciplinary charges at these hearings have to be afforded absolutely immunity from damages liability in suits brought by disgruntled inmates if this important governmental function is to be performed properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.929" offset="2259434">As to the first factor announced in Butz, the record, we think, shows beyond doubt that the Institution Discipline Committee members are engaged in the classic judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.612" offset="2302170">They are required to determine, based on the evidence before them, whether a specific individual has committed specific alleged charges, and they do that precisely the way judges or administrative law judges would go about doing the precise, same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.298" offset="4784952">In any event, unlike in a normal adjudicatory process where I think a litigant really has no reason to expect that he lost before a judge because the judge was hostile to him personally, the unfortunate reality is that in the prison disciplinary proceedings many inmates do feel that they lost solely because the board was hostile to them, or was biased or committed some act of misconduct, and we think that the inmates who lose at these IDC hearings would therefore often like to strike back in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.284" offset="4924864">Now, the Court said, in Wolff against McDonald, and I quote, it said, "Retaliation"... they are talking about retaliation by prisoners resentful of disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.732" offset="4966660">The Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.154" offset="4968332">"Retaliation is much more than a theoretical possibility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.293" offset="4984841">If that's so, and we believe it certainly is, there is every reason to expect that this retaliation would take the form of damage actions if they are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.977" offset="5027577">I think the urge to strike back by filing Bivens-type actions would often prove irresistible and as this Court is well aware, prisoners as a group are somewhat prodigious and indiscriminate litigators.</text>

I mean, right now there is some uncertainty about whether these sorts of suits can proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.185" offset="5448462">The Fourth Circuit en banc has held that Disciplinary Committee members have absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.917" offset="5467375">A number of District Courts have held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.027" offset="5471868">I think if this Court were to affirm, we would see a drastic rise in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.540" offset="5489840">But let me also say, Justice Stevens, that our principal concern here is not necessarily that the courts will be flooded by Bivens suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.662" offset="5518366">We are more concerned by the fact that if this Court affirms, and the potential is there for Bivens suits for personal damages liability, that the people who sit on these committees will take that into account when they're making their decisions on whether somebody has committed a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.407" offset="5585344">That's what we're concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.374" offset="5589210">It's the extraneous influence on the adjudicatory process, and not necessarily the fact that there will be several hundred Bivens suits filed, although I think we can expect there will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.682" offset="5626408">Now, finally, let me get to the third factor mentioned in Butz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.961" offset="5655561">We believe that the procedures at these IDC hearings provide sufficient safeguards for the protection of constitutional rights by the inmates without the need for Bivens actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.020" offset="5695790">Needless to say, the disciplinary hearings in the federal system fully meet and in many respects go beyond the requirements of the due process clause as construed in cases like Wolff and Ponte versus Real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.312" offset="5745004">People who sit on these committees, as I said earlier, have to be impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.342" offset="5761096">An inmate is entitled to notice of the charges against him, he is entitled to call witnesses, to give documentary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.385" offset="5785233">The inmate is entitled to give his side of the story, generally entitled to be present throughout the proceedings except during the deliberations of the committee, and most importantly, the IDC has to keep a complete record of its proceedings and has to justify both the liability decision it makes, whether the prisoner is guilty or innocent, on the basis of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.986" offset="5871646">It also has to justify what sanction it has decided to impose if it finds that the prisoner committed the violation, and also three levels of administrative review within the prison system, plus the opportunity of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.918" offset="5923368">There is an appeal first to the warden, then to the Regional Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and finally General Counsel of the Bureau of Prisons who personally reviews each of these matters in order to try to achieve some consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.789" offset="5978852">And this very case, I think, shows that this is a meaningful remedy because the respondents in this case appealed to the warden and then appealed to the Regional Director, and within six weeks had gotten all of the relief that they had ever asked for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.792" offset="8874892">The only argument for absolute immunity that was made by defendants was pre-trial for these IDC members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.194" offset="8912508">And another aspect of the proceeding, Your Honor, is that you asked about the prosecutor and you asked about, isn't there a charging guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.768" offset="8958797">Well, the IDC does the questioning in the proceeding, so it acts as a prosecutor and then it adjudicates, and it adjudicates on bases other than just the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.013" offset="8999757">It adjudicates on behavior, background; it adjudicates on what it knows about the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.823" offset="9023058">And I have to take strong exception to the Government's position that because these are senior... or some of them are now senior officials in the institution, that that means they are more impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.662" offset="9074363">They worked their way up through the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.005" offset="9083767">These were all guards that have been promoted, and in fact as I pointed out, Mr. Marcadis, one of the three members, was still an operational lieutenant who had day to day custodial responsibilities for Mr. Saxner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.437" offset="9129429">So, I think that's somewhat of a distinction, without a difference, in a prison context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.701" offset="9150536">The adversarial... as you get closer to the warden, that that whole kind of influence and pressure which Butz talks about that is so absent from an ALJ, there's no agency pressure, whereas here the pressure of the warden, the pressure of the situation of the fellow guards and the fellow administrators all of whom are in an adversarial, keeper-kept relationship with the prison guards is paramount, and that goes to that important question about independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.204" offset="9272580">I am flabbergasted that the Government would think that we don't take issue with the fact that these people are independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.920" offset="9299434">We certainly say, and we argue, one of the strongest points in our brief is the lack of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.715" offset="9326601">If you look at Bradley versus Fisher, if you look at Stump versus Sparkman and Pierson versus Ray, you see in all those cases, again and again they are talking about the independence of the judiciary, the importance of preserving the independence of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.772" offset="9382817">There's no independence here to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.005" offset="9391698">That is the first part of the Butz test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.644" offset="9406327">Another part of the Butz test to determine whether you get absolute immunity, and which they use to determine ALJ's, administrative law judges did, is the reliability of the information before the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.842" offset="9455123">In an ALJ hearing, in an administrative law hearing, you can't convict somebody entirely on hearsay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.358" offset="9621158">Here you have to make a constitutional claim and it's a discretionary proceeding whether you get into court or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.119" offset="9648221">So, that's another important Butz factor which is absent here, appellate review, the importance of review, and finally, the procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.787" offset="9698898">Counsel seems to be trying to say that because you get minimum due process in these hearings, that that equates with the procedural safeguards, making you functionally comparable to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.376" offset="9745187">I think this Court has again and again and again dealt with due process cases, starting with... well, before this but germane to my argument, starting with Goldberg versus Kelly, Morrissey versus Brewer, Gagnon versus Scarpelli, and then Wolff and various... Baxter and other various prison disciplinary cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.587" offset="9822092">And again and again, I can quote you language from each of those cases where you looked at disciplinary... not hearings, due process hearings which had by and large more safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.973" offset="9867649">The welfare deprivation hearing in Goldberg had the cross examination confrontation, the same with parole revocation hearings and probation revocation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.016" offset="9915819">In each of those cases the Court looked at those hearings and characterized them as informal proceedings, as non-adversarial proceedings, and just recently in the Walpole case out of Massachusetts, this Court looked at a disciplinary hearing, and Justice O'Connor, speaking for the Court, characterized that disciplinary hearing in a prison context was a "non-judicial proceeding".</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.098" offset="10020100">So, I think that it's clear that if we talk we can use the word "functionally comparable", but when we're talking about "functionally comparable" it means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.923" offset="10051447">We have to look at what a judge does and see if what a judge does and what the protections that a judge operates under, and the independence that a judge or an ALJ brings to a situation exists or--</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.746" offset="10570657">The kinds of evidence in the record here is astonishing, if you're looking at them as judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.743" offset="10594689">If you're looking at them as adversarial prison guards, then that's a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.444" offset="10617468">But if you're looking at them as judges or administrative law judges, we have to deal with the reality of where they're coming from, what their attitudes are, what kind of relationships they're in with these prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.018" offset="10663757">As Justice Stevens pointed out, the remedy is so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.344" offset="10685073">It's barely cavalier to say, well, in this case... this case happens to be the exception, I think, that proves the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.918" offset="10715375">Mr. Saxner, I think who was a jailhouse lawyer, who was in contact with the ACLU, with judges, with Congressmen, and who in fact... the reason that he was put in segregation when all is known is because there had been a death in the prison hospital and he was going out and interviewing prisoners about the abhorrent conditions in that prison hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.552" offset="10793951">Unfortunately, three other prisoners died in that hospital after this case, and the fourth death came to this Court in the Green versus Carlson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.704" offset="10830523">He was put into segregation for that activity, and those are the kinds of cases that it's so important to have a remedy, that there is no remedy in that circumstance but damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.620" offset="10882245">As was said in Bivens, it's damages or nothing in that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.650" offset="10902307">He can be let out of segregation, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days later, but he has no remedy and there is no deterrent then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.944" offset="10927489">There is no satisfactory deterrent on that kind of conduct, and it seems to me that the Government has brought some statistics that are the evidence of record, but it seems to support our position in the sense that 75 Bivens cases, he says, are pending and I didn't understand whether that was 75 Bivens cases against federal prison guards in general or just in the disciplinary due process area against hearing officers, but I am assuming the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.432" offset="11053399">You look at that in light of the 40,000 adjudicatory cases or whatever that he says that they deal with per year, and I think that... and I know in the Seventh Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the First Circuit and the Second Circuit, you have been able to sue IDC members for at least ten or 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.206" offset="11136573">I know Justice Stevens sat on the Chapman case in the Seventh Circuit in the early '70s which allowed that kind of suit.</text>
