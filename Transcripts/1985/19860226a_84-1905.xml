            <text syncTime="16.526" offset="208122">This case presents two issues for decision, first, the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Social Security Act in effect between 1977 and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.000" offset="253993">The provisions at issue permit payment of survivors' benefits to widows and widowers to continue even after they remarry after age 60, but payment of survivors' benefits to surviving divorced spouses ceases upon their marriage even if that event occurs after age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.247" offset="339047">This differing treatment of widowed spouses and divorced spouses is challenged under the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="383142">The second issue in the case concerns the propriety of the classification entered by the district court, and this issue requires the Court to consider yet again the requirements of Section 405-G of Title 42, jurisdictional provision for review of Social Security benefit claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.385" offset="467570">Before getting into the merits of the argument, I would like to clarify just how the provisions in question work, because the terminology used is not always as illuminating as it could be.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.412" offset="527651">That's a marvelous understatement.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.430" offset="539772">--Thank you, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.282" offset="547191">I thought that was almost the hardest part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.983" offset="561924">A wage earner is entitled to have his or her family receive certain types of benefits based on the wage earner's earnings attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="602571">The type of benefits involved here are called survivors benefits, and that means that they are benefits paid to certain members of the wage earner's family because the wage earner has died.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.533" offset="656174">Now, the wage earner's widow or the wage earner's widower receives benefits after the wage earner's death, and they... these benefits are called surviving widowed spouse benefits, and they come rather automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="720644">That is, the spouse is presumed to be dependent for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="744259">If the wage earner, however, was divorced before he or she dies, the wage earner's former spouse receives benefits after the wage earner's death if the marriage between the wage earner and the former spouse lasted at least ten years, and these types of benefits are called surviving divorced spouse benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.664" offset="844673">Although the rule used to be that survivors' benefits terminated upon remarriage of the spouse, and this was called the remarriage rule, in 1977 Congress eliminated this remarriage rule for widowed spouses over the age of 60, but all other survivors' benefits still continued to terminate on remarriage, and this was true not only for divorced spouses' benefits but also for benefits to dependent parents of the wage earner and dependent children of the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.705" offset="1000886">So, in 1977 Congress made a distinction for purposes of widows and widowers but it still kept in another category not only the divorced spouses but also the dependent children and dependent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.750" offset="1065042">There are three basic reasons why the step Congress took in 1977 has a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.404" offset="1095658">First, Congress has always treated married spouses different from divorced spouses, both because the entire structure of the Act is based on the family unit, and because Congress has assumed that divorced spouses depend less on each other for economic support than do couples who stay married.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.186" offset="1190744">It was rational for Congress to recognize these differences between married and divorced spouses on the event of remarriage because--</text>

            <text syncTime="273.677" offset="1236719">Ms. Kuhl, you say they have always treated them differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.170" offset="1290740">--Prior to 1977, yes, they were treated differently because initially, of course, widows and widowers... well, widows at least were getting benefits and divorced spouses were not getting benefits at all, and then Congress permitted divorced spouses to get benefits, but that divorced spouses had to be married for 20 years and to meet certain criteria of dependency before they could get benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.856" offset="1405470">So, in other words they were treated differently because Congress had a dependency test all along with regard to divorced spouses but it did not have a dependency test with regard to widows and widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.616" offset="1464507">To briefly, then, state the second reason why... the second rational basis for Congress's action here, when Congress permitted some divorced spouses to receive benefits, Congress created a situation where there was a potential for two spouses to be receiving... one, a current spouse and one a former spouse, to be receiving benefits at the same time based on the one wage earner's account, and it was--</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl</label>
            <text syncTime="477.210" offset="2050904">--Well, first of all, this Court has, I believe in Califano versus Jobst, there's sort of a chronology that the Court follows through in its opinion, but the way this ten-year test evolved, the way it evolved was, as I mentioned previously, there were no benefits for surviving... for divorced spouses, and then Congress had a two-pronged test of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.726" offset="2152886">The reason was because they were concerned about women in particular who had been married to a wage earner for a long period of time with perhaps having no job themselves and then were divorced, so the criteria that Congress set up were, number one, marriage for 20 years and number two, some... a more specific dependency test that had to do with whether the divorced spouse was receiving alimony while the wage earner was still alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.345" offset="2271377">Then, I believe in 1972, and again this is recounted in the Jobst opinion, Congress became a little bit concerned about the more specific criteria of dependency because Congress realized that there were states that did not permit alimony under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.210" offset="2358835">And so, in response to that problem, Congress said, all right, we'll be even more broadly inclusive and we won't have the specific criteria of dependency but we'll continue in effect the 20-year marriage requirement, subsequently reduced to a ten-year marriage requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.540" offset="2448174">If the test... I think if the test was, was it really a sham marriage, it would be a much shorter period of time.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="586.432" offset="2487775">As between the divorced spouse who satisfied the ten-year period, and the widow, no difference?</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl</label>
            <text syncTime="596.553" offset="2528213">No, not as of 1977, with regard to survivors' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.476" offset="2563948">But as we know, and I believe it's footnote 2 of our reply brief, divorced spouses were still being treated differently for other purposes; that is, with regard to what are called spouses' benefits which are benefits that a divorced spouse might receive when the wage earner is still alive, the remarriage rule continued, even after 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.364" offset="2691531">So that, in essence, Congress in 1977 was treating divorced spouses more alike and widowed spouses more alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.576" offset="2760285">Before discussing these points in a little bit more detail and going over two more of the rational bases on which Congress acted, I'd like to say a word about the legal standard to be applied in judging the constitutionality of Congress's actions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.538" offset="2832174">It seems clear that the standard should be the rational basis test, and district court in this case in fact applied the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.576" offset="2872298">In the context of the Social Security Act, this Court has measured classifications based on divorce, in Matthews versus De Castro, and based on remarriage in Califano versus Jobst, according to a rational basis test, and there's no reason to do otherwise here.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.407" offset="2951710">The test, then, is simply whether Congress's action can be said to manifest a patently arbitrary classification utterly lacking in rational justification, and I think the district court's error in applying this test is fairly easy to pinpoint, and it goes to the rationale that we have been discussing previously, rationale of differences in dependency between divorced spouses and widowed spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.176" offset="3070724">The district court seemed to believe that when Congress gave survivors' benefits to divorced spouses, it committed itself to the position that there was no basis whatsoever for distinguishing between divorced spouses and widowed spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.586" offset="3136344">But what the district court failed to recognize is what I've stated previously, that Congress has always treated, even in 1977, has treated divorced and widowed spouses differently, and the fact that Congress chose to treat them the same for purposes of initial eligibility for survivors' benefits does not mean that Congress was requiring them to treat them the same for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.038" offset="3250133">It was rational for Congress to give effect to he differences between the two groups at the time of remarriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.061" offset="3282316">I've discussed previously in answer to questions the chronology of Congress's first giving no benefits to divorced spouses, thereby recognizing the reality of the legal severance of relationship at the time of divorce, and then giving benefits to divorced spouses but using two criteria of dependency, 20-year duration marriage requirement plus some more specific criteria, and Congress then being concerned that the more specific criteria were not working well and retaining only the 20-year marriage requirement and then reducing the 20-year marriage requirement to a ten-year marriage requirement but still retaining that as a criteria of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.147" offset="3510626">But all of this suggests that the differences between divorced spouses and widowed spouses have been at least as apparent to Congress as their similarities.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.521" offset="3556079">Thus, when Congress considered changing the rule that ended survivors' benefits on remarriage, and when Congress chose as it did to proceed a step at a time with regard to the elimination of this remarriage rule, Congress acted quite reasonably in eliminating the remarriage rule, first for the one category of beneficiaries for whom there had never been a dependency test, and that was widows and widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.890" offset="3673630">Congress at the same time then continued, in effect, the remarriage rule for all other categories of beneficiaries, those categories being categories where there were dependency tests attached which was, as I've stated, not only the surviving divorced spouses but also dependent parents for whom there was a dependency test, and dependent children for whom there is a dependency test.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.108" offset="3778433">Put another way, Congress could rationally assume that its concerns that had been manifested in prior legislation about divorced spouses who had not worked during the years when they were married, could be set aside on the event of the remarriage of the divorced spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.271" offset="3863070">I would like to briefly mention two other things that can be said about the rationality of the distinction that Congress chose here in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.477" offset="3903926">First of all, as I have alluded to very briefly earlier, when a divorced spouse receives survivors' benefits there is a possibility that another spouse may also be receiving benefits based on the one wage earner's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.204" offset="3962858">Benefits to divorced spouses are not counted against the ceiling amount that may be paid based on one single wage earner's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.278" offset="3999116">Thus, Congress's decision to pay benefits to divorced spouses creates the potential for... and I don't mean this pejoratively but just descriptively... as sort of a double dipping based on the one wage earner's account, and this is a special kind of drain on the trust fund.</text>

I think the Court does not have to look to whether it's better or not, but I think it's a rational classification to look to the situation where there has been a divorce because I think that even creates the probability, not the certainty but the probability, of this, what I've called double dipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.613" offset="4328468">And it seems clear that it would be rational for Congress to pick the event of the divorced spouse's remarriage and this special rain on the account because at that point Congress... again, a new family unit was formed and a new basis for economic dependency accrued with the new marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.627" offset="4420523">Finally, despite the appellee's claim to the contrary, Congress clearly was motivated, certainly could have been motivated by fiscal concerns when it acted in 1977.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.937" offset="5001800">In sum, to just draw a conclusion with regard to this fiscal concern, I think that the appellees have agreed that the... by choosing the categories that it did in 1977, Congress saved about $17 million per year and this Court should be unwilling to assume that $17 million per year is simply too little for Congress rationally to be concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.675" offset="5124784">The second issue in this case relates to the class definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.729" offset="5144951">The district court lacked jurisdiction over two groups of individuals that it purported to include in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.466" offset="5175880">First, it lacked jurisdiction over persons who did not exhaust their administrative remedies, and second, it lacked jurisdiction over persons whose claims had already become final when the case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.140" offset="5226557">In this respect the district court erroneously included some persons who had received a final decision of the Secretary, more than 60 days before the case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.014" offset="5274100">First, perhaps I should say something about whether the Court needs to reach the class certification issue if it decides the constitutional issue in favor of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.056" offset="5318300">The Court in this case does have jurisdiction, indisputably, to decide the constitutional issue because the individual plaintiffs in this case did meet the 405-G requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.565" offset="5376291">In similar situations, that is where there is jurisdiction with regard to some plaintiffs in the case but there is a question with regard to the overall class certification, the Court has in some cases ruled in favor of the Government and failed to decide the class certification issues, and it did that in Califano versus Boles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.299" offset="5483184">But in other cases such as Matthews versus Diaz, the Court has in the very same circumstances gone on to decide the class certification issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.107" offset="5530414">And if I may suggest, the Court may wish to give guidance to the lower courts on this issue, related issues with respect to class certification arise in the next case to the argued, the City of New York case, and the Court of Appeals in this situation here would be required to decide the class issues because it would need to define the collateral estoppel effect of the judgment that it was entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.274" offset="5643158">As I have stated, both class issues relate to 405-G which requires, first of all, that there be a final decision of the Secretary on a claim for benefits, and secondly that the civil action be commenced within 60 days of notice of the Secretary's final decision to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.507" offset="5744095">This Court has held that these requirements must be satisfied with regard to each individual class member, and the Court has so stated in Califano versus Yamasaki.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.947" offset="5789862">In that case the Court emphasized that class relief is consistent with the need for case by case adjudication, that is evident in the structure of 405-G, only if every member of the class can meet individually the 405-G requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.177" offset="5870737">The first requirement that was not met here by some of the class members was the requirement of a final decision of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.282" offset="5907204">The district court did not limit the class to those who had exhausted the entire administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.488" offset="5940014">This Court in Weinberger versus Salfi has held that the exhaustion requirement is statutorily required and that it cannot be dispensed with by a judicial conclusion of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.136" offset="6014620">The Secretary himself can make exceptions to the exhaustion requirement and the Secretary did so in this case with regard to the individual claimants, but did so because the Secretary had reached the stage of the administrative process where the facts had been found, the issues of law had been determined insofar as the Secretary could determine them, and the only thing that was left to be decided was the constitutional issue which the Secretary could not rule on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.190" offset="6150770">Now, the class members, however, had not been through this process and I think that the importance of exhaustion can be seen in this case by looking at what happened after the district court decided the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.584" offset="6224331">At that point, the agency was required to go through the files of the individual claimant and decide who would qualify for the relief that the Court granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.376" offset="6267485">This is just the kind of fact finding that is supposed to go on before the case goes to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.046" offset="6294234">Finally, the remaining issue concerns the requirement that a claimant file suit within 60 days after the final decision of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.986" offset="6329970">I think that Califano versus Sanders holding, that motions to reopen are unreviewable--</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.921" offset="8421751">As I said, there are two consistent themes in the development of the Social Security survivors' programs, and both of those are raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.913" offset="8469712">One of those themes is Congress's recognition repeatedly over the years of various classifications whose dependency on a deceased wage earner renders them entitled to benefits under the survivors' program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.239" offset="8526972">And the other theme which runs parallel to that is Congress's persistent desire to eliminate the remarriage penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.576" offset="8560304">The remarriage penalty, of course, operates so that if a survivor beneficiary remarries someone else, the general rule was, that person would lose her Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.569" offset="8608265">But Congress has gradually eliminated the remarriage penalty in various circumstances, and it is indicated that the general remarriage rule, the remarriage penalty, should essentially be eliminated altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.477" offset="8659988">So, those two themes, I think are crucial in understanding appellees' contention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.531" offset="8684125">By 1965 Congress had recognized that divorced surviving spouses' dependency on the deceased wage earner was sufficient that they should be entitled to survivors' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.721" offset="8736892">This rendered them effectively the same in all relevant respects as non-divorced surviving spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.977" offset="8769911">The remarriage penalty, however, was still in effect and Congress recognized that it created a serious dilemma for many widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.602" offset="8812438">In 1977, therefore, Congress set out to remove the remarriage barrier, but as we have noted, removed it only for one classification of surviving spouses, those who were not divorced, what we normally call widows and widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.314" offset="8883282">I think it is very important to understand what happened in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.615" offset="8900523">The House voted to remove the remarriage penalty for both surviving divorced spouses and for surviving spouses who were not divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.671" offset="8940752">The Senate said nothing about this issue and indicated it had no intention of removing the remarriage barrier for either classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.191" offset="8974815">The issue then went to conference committee, and that conference committee as we have noted, essentially split the difference and decided to--</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.184" offset="9142731">Now, when the Conference Committee decided to split the difference, as I've called it, and remove the remarriage penalty only for widows, not for divorced surviving spouses, it provided absolutely no explanation for this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.111" offset="9202499">It was clear at that time that Congress as a general rule did want to eliminate the remarriage penalty, but no explanation was provided as to why that penalty should continue for one group of surviving spouses and not for the other group of surviving spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.989" offset="9269999">The irony is that far from providing a reason to treat these two classifications differently, remarriage if anything should have provided an incentive, as the district court observed, to treat them the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.582" offset="9336350">Congress had therefore by 1977 carefully reasoned one two crucial factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.621" offset="9368533">One, why survivors' benefits should be available to surviving divorced women, namely, their dependency on the deceased wage earner and secondly, why the remarriage penalty should be eliminated as a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.530" offset="9424122">Congress provided by that time no reasoning whatsoever about why the remarriage penalty should continue for this one discrete classification of surviving spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.255" offset="9471037">Congress based its reasoning, to the extent there was any reasoning at all, solely on divorce but it did not explain why divorce in that context was a relevant characteristic to discriminate between two classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.883" offset="9541568">Consequently the government throughout this case in the district court and the briefs for this Court, today in oral argument, has been forced to offer a series of after the fact rationales in an effort to explain what Congress might have had in mind when it treated these two classifications differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.284" offset="12035217">The district court in this case... and our argument is that a district court, as this Court has done in other instances, can infer that a final decision has been entered by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.691" offset="12080775">In the Diaz case the Secretary herself moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.153" offset="12154649">So, what we are talking here for the most part is not asking the Court to overrule the Secretary but for the Court to analyze as a practical matter what the Secretary has done with respect to whether or not a final decision has been entered in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.448" offset="12223821">We think it's logical for a district court, based on the determination that named plaintiffs have no factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.322" offset="12267289">It's logical for a district court to infer that final decisions for the class members are also appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.243" offset="12291008">For the class members as well as for the named plaintiffs there are no factual or legal disputes with the Secretary, nor is there any ability of the Secretary to take any action with respect to the claim at issue which is a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.936" offset="12353806">We think it is very important also to recognize what Justice Stevens was hinting at in his questions to my opponent, that there is no practical purpose served by forcing the class members to go to exhaustion when the named plaintiffs have already received a final decision from the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.666" offset="12432696">The effect of forcing exhaustion in that context is not only wasteful but it's counterproductive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.303" offset="12455266">If the Secretary is ultimately successful at whatever level, district, court of appeals or Supreme Court, then all the factual exhaustion which has taken place prior to the filing of the complaint will have been totally wasted because the class members for the most part are not going to be eligible for benefits anyhow, as the Court has held that the statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.717" offset="12536873">So, not only is a waste of administrative resources, but it's actually counterproductive to the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.489" offset="12571981">We think also that the Court should keep in mind the practical reason why the Secretary is pressing exhaustion in this context, and we think he's doing it because it's a shield to protect him from significant relief when plaintiffs are successful in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.716" offset="12640944">There is absolutely no practical reason to require exhaustion for named plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.553" offset="12664246">Once they receive an initial decision saying they are ineligible for benefits because their facts are such that they are not eligible under the statute, no purpose is then served by requiring them to go through an administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.362" offset="12723491">Once the Secretary determines that a constitutional claim exists, which the Secretary himself has no competence to resolve, the only logical conclusion to be drawn is that a final decision has been reached, so that no further exhaustion is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.091" offset="12794440">Now, the other component of the class action issue is what is known as the 60-day rule and that is the question of whether class members moved untimely through the administrative process and in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.754" offset="12873016">Now, it is our contention that the notice filed by the named plaintiff, Mrs. Owens, in October 1982 asking for reconsideration of her initial decision was a notice to the Secretary that a constitutional claim was being raised and that it therefore told the administrative and judicial process, this is a conventional principle, it's been used in many other contexts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.307" offset="13399227">Now, there are excellent reasons, we think, to apply this general totalling principle in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.028" offset="13422110">The remedial purposes of the Social Security Act are one, and the nature of the issue of course is another crucial component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.515" offset="13448128">This is a constitutional challenge and it is imperative, as this Court has indicated on many occasions including the Sanders case, the Social Security recipients have an opportunity to bring constitutional challenges before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.792" offset="13505180">As a practical matter if totalling is not permitted, 99 percent or 90 percent of most class actions will be prohibited from raising a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.416" offset="13551677">They will never seriously have an opportunity to bring their case to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.484" offset="13571948">The Court, this Court has construed other aspects of the statute which allows individuals to go to district court in a flexible way under the venue provision, the exhaustion provision, the question of injunctive relief, the question of class action in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.430" offset="13639762">This Court has indicated that the literal terms of 42 U.S.C. Section 405-G do not necessarily control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.186" offset="13670796">There has to be a practical way of guaranteeing that classes can be certified and the individuals can bring their cases in a realistic way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.791" offset="13709248">The class members in this case are not trying to avoid compliance with the 50-A rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.711" offset="13732863">They are simply recognizing that as a normal principle, when the Secretary is put on notice, the period for proceeding through the administrative process is told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.667" offset="13772673">No purpose, no practical purpose is served here by a literal application of the 50-day rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.655" offset="13796602">The only purposes served is that of the Secretary which artificially prevents some claimants from obtaining relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.114" offset="13854489">With regard to Honda versus Clark, I'd like to correct the statement that was made with regard to totalling against the Government there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.753" offset="13885000">The Court specifically said in that case that because the Government was acting as a stakeholder with regard to property in the Office of Alien Property, that the court would allow totalling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.211" offset="13930871">There was no potential drain upon th Treasury there and it was an exception to the usual rule with regard to the Government which is not at all applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.267" offset="13975070">Appellees state that the Secretary is trying to restrict the size of the class, but with all due respect it is Congress that has set forth the scheme under Section 405-G and this Court has recognized in Yamasaki and Ringer that Congress wants these benefits determinations to go forward on an individual basis and wants the legal issues to be raised in an individual context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.107" offset="14114460">Do you agree, though, that if the date had been advanced to the date of filing suit, that there would be totalling for all the class, and you redefined the class with reference to that date, the totalling would be proper?</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.000" offset="14166077">If someone has a final decision of the Secretary within 60 days before the suit is filed, it's not really a question of totalling but rather that in lieu of filing a separate action they may be considered to have filed vis-a-vis that action, and that's the basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.879" offset="14265552">We have not raised anything to the contrary in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.933" offset="14281748">The point here on the exhaustion and 60-day principles is that we're dealing with individuals who did have an opportunity to raise the constitutional issue in the administrative process but didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.507" offset="14332112">They let their claims become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.526" offset="14344128">It was res judicata, and what appellees are asking for here is that this Court recognize the principle that allows continuous correction process to occur with regard to the system, and that is not at all what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.587" offset="14420406">These individuals gave no indication that they wanted further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.758" offset="14445065">At each stage of the four-stage administrative process there is a notice sent stating, if you wish further review file within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.980" offset="14485921">The people who are included in the class here who should not have been did not take advantage of that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.318" offset="14515282">The rule that they are asking for here is almost as if they are asking that when a court of appeals creates a new rule of law, district court people who didn't think to raise the argument and who have... had their cases decided be allowed to re-open them over and over.</text>
