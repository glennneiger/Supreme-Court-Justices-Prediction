            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132121">We will hear arguments next in United States against Lane and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.326" offset="165349">Mr. Kuhlik, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_n_kuhlik" startTime="68.832" stopTime="407.508">
            <label>Mr. Bruce Neil Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="68.832" offset="407347">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the defendants in this case were each charged in five counts of a six-count indictment alleging mail fraud, conspiracy, and perjury in connection with three arson for profit schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.920" offset="467742">After a joint jury trial, each defendant was convicted on every count in which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.714" offset="490939">The Court of Appeals held that one of the counts was improperly joined with the other five.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.274" offset="517166">It reversed the convictions and remanded for new trials on all counts without determining whether either defendant was prejudiced in any respect by the misjoinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.269" offset="561156">Two questions are before the Court, first, whether misjoinder is an exception to the rule that reviewing courts have a duty to determine whether any error at trial was harmless, and second, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's convictions for mail fraud in connection with their arson of a duplex.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.213" offset="652898">We think it is plain that misjoinder, which is a comparatively common garden variety violation of the rules of criminal procedure does not fit within the extremely narrow category of errors that are excepted from harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.488" offset="714025">We also submit that it is equally clear that the mailing of insurance forms and fabricated invoices to the defrauded insurance company furthered the defendants' scheme to defraud within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.983" offset="772017">The defendants, J.C. and Dennis Lane, are father and son.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.371" offset="789571">Count 1 of the indictment charged J.C. Lane alone with the 1979 arson of his failing restaurant business.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.212" offset="828963">The sufficiency of the evidence supporting this count is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.835" offset="843383">Counts 2 through 4 charged both defendants with mail fraud in connection with the arson of a duplex building that they had purchased for $500 and insured for $35,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.392" offset="893643">The building was burned pursuant to their direction in early May of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.562" offset="914332">Shortly thereafter, Dennis Lane submitted a proof of loss form to the insurance adjuster which stated quite fraudulently that he had played no part in the fire and was making no attempt to deceive the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.868" offset="979533">At the same time, he received a draft payment of $7,000 with which to begin repair work on the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.896" offset="1015687">The insurance adjuster later mailed that proof of loss form to the insurance company headquarters and it was this mailing that was charged in Count 2 of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.984" offset="1059990">As the summer of 1980 progressed, the insurance company made additional payments totalling $5,000 to the Lanes with which to continue repairs, and the defendants continued to submit fraudulent forms to the insurance adjuster.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.398" offset="1137626">Additional forms were mailed by the adjuster to the company headquarters in August of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.724" offset="1163017">It was this mailing that was charged in Count 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.707" offset="1174929">Finally, the insurance company settled the claim completely with a payment of $12,250 on September 16th of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.061" offset="1228323">Two days later, the insurance adjuster mailed fraudulent invoices that the defendants had fabricated to support their repair claim to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.588" offset="1278374">It was this final mailing on September 18th of 1980 that was charged in Count 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.929" offset="1299794">These are the counts whose sufficiency is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.053" offset="1312333">Count 5 charged both defendants with conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with their planned arson of a phony flower shop, and Count 6 charged Dennis Lane alone with perjury before a grand jury that was investigating the flower shop scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.749" offset="1379102">The defendants were tried jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.294" offset="1389238">The trial lasted six days.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.903" offset="1395716">The government produced over two dozen witnesses and over 100 exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.230" offset="1412957">The defendants countered chiefly by character witnesses and Dennis Lane's denials that he had done anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.852" offset="1439497">The jury convicted on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.430" offset="1449737">The Court of Appeals held that Count 1, which charged J.C. Lane alone with the restaurant arson, was improperly joined the other five counts under Rule 8(b) of the criminal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.143" offset="1496653">The court refused to determine whether any... either of the defendants was prejudiced in any respect by this error, holding only that in its circuit misjoinder was prejudicial per se, and not subject to harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.902" offset="1559661">The Court of Appeals also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the mail fraud convictions in connection with the duplex, holding that the mailings of the fraudulent proof of loss forms and repair invoices helped to hide the defendants' fraud and served to help them obtain and retain the proceeds of their fraud, but the court did remand for a new trial on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.955" offset="1659866">Turning first to the harmless error issue, we think it is... or this Court has consistently made it clear that reviewing courts have a duty under Rule 52(a) of the criminal rules and 28 USC 2111 to determine the harmlessness or prejudicial effect of any error at trial before predicating a reversal on such an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.351" offset="1753489">This rule serves important purposes--</text>

            <text syncTime="432.310" offset="1861323">Our position is that the language under 52(a) that we would direct your attention, Justice Stevens, is to affecting the substantial right, and this Court has made it clear since at least Chapman that even constitutional errors are subject to harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.036" offset="1932167">The inquiry is not whether a substantial right has been... is in question, but whether the right is affected by a violation that contributes to the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.986" offset="1971977">That is the inquiry that the Court set forth in Kotteakos and in Chapman.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.623" offset="2314599">And I would note that McElroy was decided over 20 years before the first harmless error statute was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.620" offset="2342498">Yes, but Rule 52(a) expressly picks up the substantial right language, and that is why I am just not entirely... still not entirely clear what you are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.882" offset="2379592">You are saying that there is a substantial right involved, but it is not affected if one can call it harmless?</text>
            <text syncTime="566.802" offset="2399236">Is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce Neil Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="567.568" offset="2402371">Well, perhaps the best way to put it is that the substantial right in any case is the right to a jury verdict that has not been affected by error, and in that respect we would say that if there has been misjoinder, the Court must inquire into whether the substantial right which is to the untainted jury verdict has been affected in the particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.587" offset="2522430">Well, wouldn't that make the rule read exactly... what you really do, as I understand your interpretation, the rule then should simply read,</text>
            <text syncTime="604.631" offset="2550642">"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance. "</text>

            <text syncTime="611.502" offset="2578123">"which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. "</text>
            <text syncTime="614.408" offset="2589721">You are saying if it is... that is the equivalent of harmless.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce Neil Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="618.516" offset="2606126">--Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.172" offset="2608738">I mean, that is... what the rule was called is the harmless error rule, and the rule, which is to be read of a piece with Section 2111 of the code, which does not have the substantial right language, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.507" offset="2686061">Well, Section 2111 was designed simply to make sure that the harmless error rule applied on appeal, and the Court... Congress, when it reenacted that statute in 1948 specifically did away with the technical modifier on error.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.127" offset="2752621">So, the point is that Congress has made it clear both in the rule and in the statute, and this Court has certainly made it clear in Chapman that the harmless error inquiry is not limited to mere technical defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.325" offset="2805388">It applies whether the error is constitutional, whether it is statutory, whether it is a violation of the criminal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.446" offset="2829839">That is all that we ask here, is that this same inquiry be made with respect to misjoinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.475" offset="2853976">And in that regard, the harmless error inquiry serves several important purposes, principally the prompt and fair administration of justice, and it gives effect to the central purpose of a criminal trial, which is to determine the factual issue of the defendant's guilt or innocence, not to sow the seeds for reversible error upon later review.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.904" offset="2943732">And these... these considerations have special force in the context of misjoinder, which is a fairly common technical violation of the rules that often, as we submit here, have an absolutely minimal effect on the outcome of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.538" offset="3006217">Now, we do not believe that misjoinder can be said to fit within any of the exceptions that the Court has recognized to the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.285" offset="3045192">The principal exception that the Court has recognized is for rights that are so fundamental to the modern conception of a criminal trial that they simply cannot be deemed harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.514" offset="3102139">For example, the right to access to counsel or to a trial before an unbiased tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.261" offset="3125127">But Rule 8 simply does not rise anywhere near this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.306" offset="3145293">It is not even a constitutional standard to begin with, much less one that is so fundamental that unlike most constitutional rights under Chapman should be excepted from harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.113" offset="3196493">Nor do we believe that there is any other basis for excepting Rule 8 from the harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.406" offset="3233692">As we discussed answering Justice Stevens' question, we do not believe that the McElroy case stands for such a proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.919" offset="3263785">Moreover, as we point out in our brief, Rule 14, which applies to prejudicial joinder, does not stand as a directive to exempt Rule 8 from misjoinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.147" offset="3316657">We would also submit that the error here in this particular case was clearly harmless in view of the strength of the government's case, the District Court's careful instructions to the jury considering the separate consideration to be given to each defendant, and that the jury not consider the evidence with respect to Count 1 against Dennis Lane, and the fact that much of this evidence would properly be admissible on retrial in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.270" offset="4413172">The scheme that was alleged in Counts 2 through 4 of the indictment was primarily one to defraud the insurance company by running up the repair costs on the building that the defendants had burned after it turned out that their torch was unable to destroy it completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.044" offset="4488196">Now, the elements of a mail fraud offense under Section 1341 are a scheme to defraud and a mailing in furtherance of this scheme caused by the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.739" offset="4587043">They say only that the mailings could not have furthered their scheme because they had already received the funds in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.858" offset="4627481">Turning first to Counts 2 and 3, which can be disposed of almost immediately, these counts alleged mailings that took place in May and August of 1980 before the defendants had received the last and largest payment in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.696" offset="4686831">The scheme was quite plainly ongoing at this time, and indeed Dennis Lane admitted at trial that they would not have received the final payment had not the earlier mailing been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.809" offset="4967282">But even if they had, that does not carry with it a blanket immunity from the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.087" offset="4992464">This Court in Samson and the Courts of Appeals have consistently made it clear that mailings that have the effect of lulling the defendants' victims into a false sense of security, thereby postponing their complaint to the authorities and making it less likely that the defendants will be found out are within the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.455" offset="5077937">That is precisely what happened here, as the Court of Appeals found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.704" offset="5094864">I mean, it is difficult to think of something more directly connected to a scheme to defraud the insurance company than the mailing of the fraudulent proof of loss forms and invoices to the company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.525" offset="5146168">The defendants have only one final argument, which is that we neither charged nor proved that they had the specific intent to use the mails.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.837" offset="6415406">I am talking about their factual statement of the background of the case, not their conclusions, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.350" offset="6445499">The court, the appellate court said that Count 1 should not have been joined with the others because it was not part of the same series of acts or transactions as Count 2 through 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.531" offset="6518224">The government, of course, their single complaint as to the first part of their brief relates to the failure of the court to make application of the harmless error rule, and they contend that a conviction may not be reversed under Rule 8(b) unless... if the error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.738" offset="6626998">Now, it is our contention that the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing without determining the question of misjoinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.468" offset="6669943">I think it is significant, and perhaps we need to note in passing that the government in its brief gives great consideration to the case of U.S. versus Hasting, but never once has counsel argued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.008" offset="6736085">Because it is in the brief, I feel that I need to confront it in order that it not go unanswered but remain for consideration in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.046" offset="6976203">Yes, and the reason that I say that, Justice White, is because I believe that the rules to make proof have carefully placed the boundaries under Rule 8(b), and they have established standards, and they say beyond this standard you shall not go, and they say in effect that misjoinder is reversible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.066" offset="7096366">There are numberless reasons to illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.281" offset="7117159">We know what many of these are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.343" offset="7137430">We know that there is danger in misjoinder that there will be a transference of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.808" offset="7163344">We know that there is danger under King versus U.S. of guilt by association, evidentiary spillover, and the reasons cited in McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.866" offset="7211514">Now, let me say simply this in regards to Hasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.363" offset="7233561">The reason we say Hastings does not apply in this case because Hastings is... Hasting is not a misjoinder case, and we think that that is very important, because all Hasting really did was to make a global statement of general principles about the harmless error doctrine, and Hasting itself recognizes that there are certain categories of cases to which the harmless error doctrine does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.256" offset="7369084">Counsel stated those, those that deny an impartial magistrate like Tumey versus Ohio, those that Professor Wright mentions, like the Estes case where there is pretrial prejudice, double jeopardy, and then finally the denial of counsel as is set out in Wainwright and in Strickland versus Washington, and Strickland versus Washington says that in some cases that the cost of this case by case inquiry into prejudice would be cost prohibitive because there is such a potential for prejudice in Rule 8(b) violations, and if we turn to McElroy, and incidentally, McElroy is still good, viable law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.527" offset="7946181">I say that Kotteakos applies more to the question of joinder or misjoinder in relation to 52(a), because Kotteakos says that misjoinder is a violation of a substantial right, that right being not to be tried en masse, and of course we know McElroy is exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.907" offset="8047745">There were eight defendants, originally nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.126" offset="8060598">One somehow was dropped, and eight in two separate indictments, six in one and two in the other, were consolidated for trial, and McElroy said that it is the substantial right not to be tried en masse, and Kotteakos picks up on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.401" offset="8133636">Kotteakos says that it is rather even so whether the error itself had substantial influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.849" offset="8171461">It says, if so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.925" offset="8191732">I believe it important to mention as one of the Justices has the fact that there are two people charged in this case, father and son, and when we are talking about the question of harmless error, there are evidentiary facts that make for differing interpretations as to the relative guilt of these individuals, and certainly as to the relative prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.838" offset="8295386">We know that Rule 8(b) prevents the necessity of a defense of a multiplicity of offenses, and we know that it also preserves the integrity of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.832" offset="8351393">Of course, the other side of that is the argument that joinder promotes judicial economy, but we believe that any benefit in this regard is outweighed by the inherent prejudice of misjoinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.105" offset="8420461">I would like to talk with the Court briefly about the government's construction in its brief about Rule 8(b) and 52(a), and we say that their argument for the construction of Rule 52(a), the harmless error rule, in application to all cases would simply eviscerate Rule 8(b), because Rule 8(b) sets the limits, and says that misjoinder exists if you have a joinder in violation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.462" offset="8613871">Now, it is interesting to note that in the case of Ward versus United States, that Chief Justice Burger himself when writing as a circuit judge relying upon McElroy said that where multiple defendants are charged with offenses in no way connected and are tried together, they are prejudiced by this very fact, and the trial judge has no discretion to deny relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.248" offset="8873110">I believe that I have seen such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.934" offset="8883768">I do know this, that the McElroy... in my opinion, and I was asked about Kotteakos, I believe that the McElroy analysis of misjoinder is completely consistent with Justice Black's opinion in Chapman versus California and Justice Rutledge's opinion in Kotteakos versus U.S.--</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.111" offset="8980526">Now, Professor Wright has said that cases holding that misjoinder cannot be harmless error have consistently relied upon McElroy in their reasoning and in their language as well, and I think it is important to note as Justice Stevens' question indicates that Rule 52(a) in talking about harmless error has a specific exception in it when it says any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights, and as I have said previously, Kotteakos says that misjoinder is a violation of a substantial right, because it is a violation of the right not to be tried en masse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.777" offset="9195148">Kotteakos, of course, was a variance case, and they did say harmless error inquiry was appropriate, at least in reviewing variances, and this is a misjoinder case, and all the other examples you have given where there was no harmless error are constitutional error cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.563" offset="9294309">I cannot think of any right now, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.702" offset="9314893">In that regard, I do think that it is important that we remember that Rule 16(b) itself... I am sorry, that Rule 8(b) talks about the competing considerations that exist in these cases, and it just... it just simply says... oh, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.982" offset="9483958">I remember now the answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.809" offset="9499318">You were asking me if I knew of any other cases that didn't have constitutional errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.103" offset="9532441">I cannot name any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.226" offset="9536934">But what I wanted to say in response, Your Honor, is this, that the rule making authority that was delegated by the Congress to the Court under the necessary and proper clause of the Third Amendment makes the enunciation of this rule literally in my opinion a constitutional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.904" offset="9635677">And I think that while it may not rise to the height of a constitutional error, that it still is a significant mandate of the Congress through its authorized rule making authority, and that it should not and cannot be denominated as harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.960" offset="9711954">There were... I want to turn now to my consideration of the second point, but before I do that, I want to talk with the Court about the government's contention that the misjoinder in this case could be taken care of by considerations such as the overwhelming weight of the evidence and the fact that much of the evidence would be admissible in the trial of another case upon remand, and their matters in regards to retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.500" offset="9922083">We think that an attempt to retry these defendants together would again accentuate the inherent prejudice that incurred to Dennis Lane by having this particular Count 1 presented and evidence presented in regard to that brought to the attention of the trial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.033" offset="10064190">There are... I believe that one of the Justices mentioned the possibility of error to the various parties, and I think this is something that we need to consider here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.198" offset="10124898">The evidence that was admitted under Count 1 in this case obviously contributed to the conviction of Dennis Lane on the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.272" offset="10173172">Now, the Count 1, we need to remember, related to a fire over a year in advance of the fire alleged in Counts 2, 3, and 4, and it was charged alone against J.C. Lane, who was the father of Dennis Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.015" offset="10248092">Now, when you come along and consider the one charge against J.C. Lane in the first count, Counts 2, 3, and 4 involve both defendants, and Count 5 involved both defendants in a conspiracy to commit arson for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.553" offset="10318309">Now, if we had only Counts 2, 3, and 1 which relates alone to J.C. Lane, then we have two fires involved in a single family, and certainly a suspicion that this was not accidental or the overpowering urge to consider that there may be some connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.491" offset="10473999">And then when we add Court 5, which relates to the conspiracy between father and son to carry out a scheme for profit in Lubbock, Texas, we have evidence there presented of three separate fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.437" offset="10545783">Now, there is danger to J.C. Lane in Count 1 because of the possibility of the jury saying here is a father who not only did something himself, but he involved his son in a later and still... a later transaction and still later conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.662" offset="10638674">So, we think clearly the danger is evident in Count 1 as to both of them, and then the misjoinder of Count 6 resulted in prejudice, we believe, to J.C. Lane because... and certainly to Dennis because Dennis is charged with perjury, and he is charged with perjury directly in relation to Count 5, which is the conspiracy to commit arson in Lubbock, and in Counts 2 through 5 of the indictment, in addition to alleging his own criminal activity, then J.C. Lane is involved in arson with his son, and then Count 6 in regard to perjury involves him in perjury in relation to another count on conspiracy where he is charged with his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.389" offset="10865626">And so there is a possibility for it to begin to look like that father influenced son and the son is supporting the father.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.296" offset="11169274">Now, the Article 18, USCA's 1341, requires that the government prove that the alleged use of the mails was for the purpose of executing the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.009" offset="11228101">We cite Kahn versus U.S., which says that the statute only reaches those instances in which the use of the mails is in the execution of the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.909" offset="11279719">Our allegation is that in Counts 2, 3, and 4, which relate to arson in regards to an address of 1105 South Jackson in Amarillo, that the scheme had reached its fruition as ch count or each offense, 2, 3, and 4, because Dennis Lane had received the money prior to the mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.898" offset="11391628">Now, there is a chart at Page 29 of our brief, and I call it to the Court's attention because it sets out very clearly the counts, the date that the check was received, and the date of the mailing of the proof of loss or other paper in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.950" offset="11503850">Count 2, Dennis Lane received the check on 5/9/80 in Amarillo, Texas, from a local adjuster who wrote it out in his office in front of him and delivered it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.600" offset="11558498">Dennis Lane delivered to the man a proof of loss at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.292" offset="12461185">But what we do say is this, that the fraudulent intent necessary must be present at the very time that the defendant uses the mail or knowingly causes the use of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.393" offset="12545613">Now, Gibson versus... U.S. versus Gibson says this, and we think that the Court of Appeals opinion overlooks this basis, and the opinion in fact imputes an intent to lull which was neither alleged nor proved, and which was expressly disputed by Dennis Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.243" offset="12637042">Dennis Lane expressly said that... and this is found at Page 797 of the statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.973" offset="12683958">He testified that he absolutely did not know that the proofs of loss had to be mailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.780" offset="12727217">Inherent in that is his denial of intent to cause the mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.620" offset="12762534">And at another place, at Page 859 of the statement of facts, he says that he did not consciously cause the adjuster to mail anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.115" offset="12820526">In summary, because of my diminishing time, we believe there is insufficient evidence of an intent to lull, that the mental culpability that is necessary in this kind of a case can neither be imputed to the respondent nor can it be supplied by proof of the criminal act alone, and that it cannot be said that the alleged use of the mail was for the purpose of executing the scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.460" offset="12957930">Two points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.209" offset="12964931">First, Justice O'Connor asked me earlier about the effect of a District Court's finding that there was not sufficient prejudice to require a severance under Rule 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.705" offset="13010906">I would like to clarify that a greater amount of prejudice could certainly be tolerated under Rule 14 than would be tolerated on a harmless error inquiry under Rule 8, so that the District Court would have the discretion to refuse to grant a severance under Rule 14 because the additional amount of prejudice would be tolerable there that amount of prejudice would result in a reversal under Rule 8 on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.178" offset="13120830">The second point is simply to emphasize that under the mail fraud statute there is no separate crime of lulling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.567" offset="13146325">The crime is a scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.487" offset="13158028">Lulling is simply one way that the mailing can further that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.469" offset="13173910">If there is nothing further.</text>
