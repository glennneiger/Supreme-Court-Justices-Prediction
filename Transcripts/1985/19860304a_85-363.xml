            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135989">Mr. DeFranks, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="79.516" stopTime="142.109">
            <label>Mr. John J. DeFranks</label>
            <text syncTime="79.516" offset="453951">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="464818">The present case on a writ of certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals involves the warrant seizure of 13 videocassette recordings including eight titles alleged to be obscene under New York's obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="515496">The issue as we see it, before this Court, is twofold: firstly, whether the New York Court of Appeals has elevated the standard of proof necessary to support the evidentiary seizure of presumptively protected material, and secondly, whether the Constitution of the United States requires such an elevation in light of the circumstances of the present case and the available First Amendment safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.529" offset="622076">Now, although it is here disputed, I think the record provides firm support for our contention that the standard has in fact been elevated.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.033" offset="652064">In the words of the majority, there must be enough proof before the Magistrate to allow him to judge the obscenity of the films and to determine that they are not entitled to constitutional protection.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="142.109" offset="704413">And you think that's the function of the jury in the trial of the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. DeFranks</label>
            <text syncTime="144.225" offset="712877">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.894" offset="715489">It was mere than imprecise language on the part of the Court of Appeals, and this is clear upon reading the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.250" offset="752897">In the third paragraph of the dissenting opinions he points out to the majority that they have required an unambiguous demonstration of obscenity in order to support the present seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="798872">He advised them that the standard has been universally rejected by the courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.128" offset="824472">The majority responds in footnote 3, not to deny the elevated standard but in essence to confirm it, chiding the dissent for not having provided any case authority for his claim of universal rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.721" offset="886853">The dissenter took four more opportunities to point out to the majority that they have elevated the standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.058" offset="912139">All four references were ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.493" offset="921961">They certainly were not denied.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="198.629" offset="930425">Mr. DeFrank, do we have, to read the dissent to understand the majority opinion, do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="202.914" stopTime="287.520">
            <label>Mr. John J. DeFranks</label>
            <text syncTime="202.914" offset="947561">No, I don't believe you have to, but the dissent makes it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.783" offset="959055">The majority speaks for itself on the unequivocal standard where they say, we look at this information and we can see it being inculpatory, or another interpretation where it may be less inculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.943" offset="1011718">So, the majority makes clear what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.978" offset="1023839">In its legal analysis the Court of Appeals committed a fatal flaw which probably resulted in the elevated standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.683" offset="1062709">They relied upon the scrupulous exactitude requirement of Stanford to raise the standard of proof, yet in this case the Magistrate made the probable... cause determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.658" offset="1114536">He designated only certain films for seizure, and only those films were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.212" offset="1132822">Further, the term "scrupulous exactitude" seems to be contradictory to the term "probable cause".</text>
            <text syncTime="256.382" offset="1161452">How can we ever be exact about what supposedly is Appeals probable, and that was the question the Court of was determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.638" offset="1194471">More importantly, the Court of Appeals aired in applying a prior restraint analysis to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.029" offset="1236058">No prior restraint was demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.895" offset="1243476">No substantial restraint was demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.664" offset="1254552">And in fact, the record indicates that there ware available safeguards to prevent any type of substantial restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.600" offset="1490386">We are not talking about a first-run film, in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.652" offset="1510552">It's important to note that no injunction or order against further dissemination was ever contemplated, nor was an order of destruction ever contemplated in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.603" offset="4494363">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.005" offset="4503976">I believe that the decision below is simply a reflection, first of all, of the Court's interpretation of its own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.645" offset="4534487">As you'll notice when you read their decision, they rely substantially upon decisions of the New York State Court of Appeals, and they discuss, and I think in line with Maryland v. Macon, they discuss the federal cases as guidance and they take the federal law of Roaden and Lee and so on from the standpoint of saying that there has to be a presumption of protection under the First amendment, that there is a higher hurdle that must be achieved when we're analyzing this kind of material, but basically th bedrock of this decision is state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.532" offset="4666040">And in answering Mr. DeFranks, he says that they do not, the majority, answer the dissent, and the dissent cites no authority, they cite no state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.305" offset="4705119">They rely from time to time upon federal cases which I think, when you analyze them, we determine just how low and how easy it has become throughout all these federal jurisdictions to obtain a warrant, to stop a publication which happens naturally in every case where a search warrant is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.534" offset="4778053">There is a chill that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.336" offset="4785262">I think that the language of the Chief Justice in the Roaden case, and speaking on behalf of the Court indicating that when you take a film it's the equivalent of taking a number of books and magazines, and that holds true here, and that's what's happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.475" offset="4925801">And so, when someone is given a search warrant and they take not simply one copy for evidentiary purposes but all the copies that they could find, and in this case you'll see and the record shows that they took two copies when they found two copies, and they took one copy when they found one copy, and the police had already copied themselves all of these tapes prior to the time they executed their search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.440" offset="5025693">They had no reason to take these particular tapes if they were simply interested in evidence versus interested in something beyond evidence which would necessitate them taking all the copies that were available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.228" offset="9744871">I think what that means is this: as this Court said in Roaden and Heller and Lee Art and all the cases we've talked about today, there's a higher standard in a sense that the judge must focus searchingly on the question of obscenity, and even this Court used the word, on the question of obscenity, in Marcus, as opposed to probable obscenity.</text>
