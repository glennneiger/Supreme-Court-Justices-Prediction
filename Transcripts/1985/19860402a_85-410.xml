            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Berardo</label>
            <text syncTime="228.148" offset="1044788">First, the jury was authorized to award actual damages, being admonished not to consider speculative damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.654" offset="1082823">Then the jury was authorized, if they found no actual damages, to award nominal damages and in both cases to award punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.760" offset="1119290">After having been instructed on damages in that manner, the jury was then instructed that it could award damages for the intrinsic value of the constitutional rights, taking into account the importance of the right in the history of our country and the importance of the right in the context of the activities in which the Plaintiff was involved at the time of the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.291" offset="1217406">Sequentially, and because the jury has already been admonished not to award punitive damages against a municipal corporation prior to receiving the intrinsic value instruction, it is then permitted to look at the intrinsic value and award damages against the Board of Education for the intrinsic value of the right in the absence of any proof that there were damages that flowed from what the Board of Education did or that the intrinsic value is involved at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.399" offset="1353869">I think in that way, by viewing the instructions as a whole and looking at the sequence, it can be seen that the instruction is extremely prejudicial, first of all, to the Board of Education, but, secondly, to the rest of the defendants in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.272" offset="1405278">The reason it is so prejudicial is because as to the rest of the defendants, they have already been considered in light of the punitive damages instruction and the additional inherent value instruction allows a multiplier effect after punitive damages have already been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.751" offset="1475182">The objection to the instruction that was given and the instruction again is... the complaint of instruction is the intrinsic value instruction is that it violated the rule of Carey versus Piphus.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.708" offset="1519068">Secondly, that it allowed the jury to speculate as to damages which is a violation of Carey and other precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.314" offset="1557520">The speculation is I think most troublesome to the defendants and petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.337" offset="1589598">How can one measure the value of the First Amendment or any procedural due process right?</text>
            <text syncTime="372.693" offset="1623035">It invites the jury to order or prioritize or find a value for really a priceless right.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.799" offset="1655427">The instruction to the jury itself indicated that damages for the intrinsic value of those rights are very difficult to measure, but, in effect, that instruction told the jury that the value of those rights are great.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.391" offset="1717807">They were presumed by the court to have great value because of the context of the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.914" offset="1751871">As a result, in terms at least of the objection that was made to the court, it was quite clear, not only to the court but to plaintiffs and defendants at trial, what the nature of the objection to the instruction was.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.090" offset="1816550">The court responded on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to further objection concerning the instruction, saying that counsel had not requested the court to segregate the damages between procedural and substantive deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.937" offset="1899933">We would urge the Court to consider that it would have made no difference that procedural and substantive deprivations were segregated for purposes of determining if the award was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.763" offset="1951237">The real distinction is whether intrinsic value damages could be segregated from actual damages for the deprivation of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.654" offset="2002855">There are several unwarranted consequences of the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.641" offset="2026783">First, the intrinsic value instruction conflicts with the availability of nominal damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.728" offset="2055100">There is just no reason to give a nominal damage instruction if you can, in the absence of nominal damages or in the absence of actual damages, give damages for the intrinsic value of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.673" offset="2118943">It allows speculation by the jury and it encourages plaintiffs to look at the value of a constitutional right involved before they file litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.831" offset="2167531">In encourages some ordering of constitutional rights by value.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.818" offset="2191459">Secondly, it permits a multiplier in the context of... at least in the context of which--</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.866" offset="9627685">Did it put any limits?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Heldt</label>
            <text syncTime="2376.001" offset="9636253">The only limit was imposed by the plaintiff's complaint which, as I understand it, was considerably higher than the amount returned by the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.424" offset="9669899">I did not draft the complaint and I did not select the numbers in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.411" offset="9689856">But, as I recall, the complaint raised the issues of some larger amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.613" offset="9710650">What I want to continue saying, because I think it is important to understand the distinction in a way the jury instructions are drafted, plaintiff is obligated to prove under these instructions every element of his case, including the conduct of the defendants prior proximately caused damage to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.978" offset="9796122">That is generally a threshold legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.328" offset="9805526">It is tested as it was here by motions for directed verdict at the close of my proofs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.965" offset="9820050">Did the plaintiff prove sufficient damage that a jury could find that element has been met?</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.619" offset="9850666">And, of course, the district court said, yes, there is sufficient evidence in this record to find some damage and I am going to allow the case to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.659" offset="9882849">Every single time this court instructed... He actually did it four times, the district court actually did it four times, three times on Mr. Stachura's claims and a fourth time on the student plaintiff, James David McDonald's claim, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.668" offset="9942930">And, the court said, even in the student plaintiff's case, although the student plaintiff only asks for nominal damages and nothing more, one of the elements that James David McDonald must prove is that he suffered damages as a result of... as a proximate result of the conduct of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.415" offset="10029866">And, it is not hard to understand in this record why the jury no-caused Mr. McDonald because Mr. McDonald didn't take the stand and he didn't try and testify that he suffered some damage and there was no expert testimony of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.155" offset="10084828">There was no testimony that James David McDonald had been damaged at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.809" offset="10111472">What Mr. Berardo suggests is that the damage instructions have to be merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.946" offset="10132057">And, in fact, the opposite is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.498" offset="10146268">I started to say that once the court is satisfied that a plaintiff has met that element of proof, has established some quantum of damage, the case goes to the jury and the instructions on damages are merely a guide to assessing and weighing the damages that the jury is obligated to find in order to satisfy those elements of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.013" offset="10236233">It tells the jury what things it may take into consideration, what things it ought not to take into consideration, it posits a test, you ought to try and put the plaintiff in the same position as he had been in if his rights had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.671" offset="10286911">The instructions are not how to award damages but how to assess damages if you find there are any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.213" offset="10325050">There are no four categories of damages in the special interrogatory form as Mr. Berardo would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.283" offset="10349396">That special interrogatory form doesn't say how much damages do you award to compensate Mr. Stachura, and if none, what nominal damages do you award, and if you award either, do you award punitive and then create a fourth category and say, oh, yes, now what damage is the award for the value of constitutional rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.709" offset="10419090">At all times there were only three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.378" offset="10429748">And, indeed, the word compensate or compensation appears twice in the very instruction that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.867" offset="10463708">It is not non-compensatory damages, it is merely a part of the calculus by which one places a value on things that are generally intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.456" offset="10498085">What is the value of a loss of a leg?</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.842" offset="10511564">You can't decide that without some notion of what it is like to live life with two legs and what it might be like to live life with only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.931" offset="10547926">I submit that there is no basis in this case for a reversal of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.219" offset="10577079">The jury may certainly consider the significance of the rights before it as a part of the process of evaluating what damages to award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.261" offset="10629219">No inherent value was sought or argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.165" offset="10644893">And Rule 51 certainly doesn't count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.565" offset="10654506">It is the raising of such things as improper causation instructions for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.854" offset="10683659">I don't think there is any meaningful prejudice or probability of prejudice that necessitates a remand for any purposes and I would ask the Sixth Circuit be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.524" offset="10714274">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Berardo</label>
            <text syncTime="2650.594" offset="10734650">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.565" offset="10750532">Just a couple of very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.632" offset="10758787">First of all, to say the principal arguments here are raised for the first time belies the fact that the arguments to the jury and the entire presentation of this case to the trial court from defendants' side was aimed at attempting to limit the damages to those that were caused by the action of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.514" offset="10846245">Causation has been an issue throughout this case and continues to be the issue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.633" offset="10866725">The instruction, we submit, does not adequately reflect the fact that causation is the elementary principle of damages that overrides the entire system of tort compensation.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2694.773" offset="10911342">Does your objection go to causation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_j_berardo" startTime="2697.892" stopTime="2699.761">
            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Berardo</label>
            <text syncTime="2697.892" offset="10923776">Justice O'Connor, I think so.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2699.761" offset="10931299">As I looked at it, your objection to the instruction was that they allowed the jury to speculate on the value of a constitutional right citing Carey.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_j_berardo" startTime="2708.700" stopTime="2831.412">
            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Berardo</label>
            <text syncTime="2708.700" offset="10967035">To say speculate to me means to permit the jury to determine damages without relation to objective factors and without relation to what caused the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.925" offset="11011966">In fact, the instruction itself defined a violation of constitutional rights or a deprivation of constitutional rights as the injury, then went on to allow damages to be awarded without regard to either causation or determination of actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.302" offset="11085422">I think if you read that instruction, you will get that flavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.604" offset="11098692">Notwithstanding the rest of the precautionary instructions, the fact that it is given last in that context would allow the jury to award damages without regard to actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.412" offset="11145921">Secondly, to say that Carey versus Piphus is not the substantive due process case is not entirely accurate because Briscoe in a companion case had a free speech claim concerning his earring and that, I submit, was before the Court at the time that was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.607" offset="11214676">The Court at that time declined to say that the rule didn't apply in substantive due process cases but left the question opened to be determined in each individual circumstance depending upon the right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.617" offset="11270682">I think additionally it is inconsistent for counsel to argue that after asking for an award... Excuse me, after asking for an instruction on damages that he can then take the position, either before the jury or before this Court, that the instruction is harmless when, in fact, the intent of the instruction was to permit damages to be awarded and to permit the jury to assess factors in assessing the damages against the defendants that otherwise would not have been assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.088" offset="11404534">Finally, proof of actual damages in this case does not cure the error of this overbroad instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.627" offset="11442777">It only exacerbates the error.</text>
