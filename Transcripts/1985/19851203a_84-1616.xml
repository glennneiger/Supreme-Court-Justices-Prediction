            <label>Mr. Frank M. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="180854">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the decisions of the courts below in this case destroy the balance between the coexisting equal independent court systems that form the basis of our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.346" offset="237487">Petitioners here seek the reversal of an injunction of an ongoing state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.381" offset="257654">The Federal District Court's basis for that injunction was its determination that an earlier federal case barred the state action under principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.272" offset="305197">That issue had already been litigated fully and fairly in the state court at the time of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.610" offset="330588">In addition, the injunction is directed toward the litigation, who was never a party to that earlier federal judgment, and whose only opportunity to litigate his issues came in the state court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.901" offset="375727">The case arises out of these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.887" offset="391714">In February of 1979, a Montgomery steel company, Parsons Steel Industries, its parent corporation, and the stockholders of that corporation filed a lawsuit against the bank, a loan officer, and a number of other individuals in Montgomery County State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.664" offset="454826">This is what we have come to call the state action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.183" offset="468828">The issues there raised a number of claims under state law, purely under state law, fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and a number of other claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.324" offset="509474">Approximately six weeks later, that steel company was adjudicated a bankrupt on the petition of several of its creditors, an involuntary bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.780" offset="547195">At that time its parent corporation and the shareholders of that corporation lost all authority to act for the subsidiary which was in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.218" offset="588991">Some six weeks later, the parent corporation and its shareholders filed a second action in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.741" offset="623055">Although on very similar factual allegations... the complaints are similar... the legal claim made there was a violation of a narrowly drawn federal statute, the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.782" offset="667254">It is undisputed in this case that no damages were sought on behalf of the trustee or the bankrupt corporation in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.303" offset="697347">The cases proceeded parallel through the two court systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.010" offset="744158">Now, you said they were similar facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.914" offset="759832">Were they essentially the same facts alleged in the federal court proceeding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_m_wilson" startTime="157.849" stopTime="244.322">
            <label>Mr. Frank M. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="157.849" offset="775505">At the time the complaints were filed, they were, very similar facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.170" offset="792851">There were amendments to both complaints during the course of these proceedings where additional allegations were made in both actions and they changed some, but at the time of the filing, there is no question that they were very similar, and there is no dispute about that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.680" offset="854813">The federal court bifurcated the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.315" offset="869337">They issued a liability from damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.417" offset="877801">There was a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.683" offset="882816">The jury resolved the federal action issues in favor of the plaintiffs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.070" offset="900371">The trial judge granted judgment NOV, judgment outstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.356" offset="917507">He held that there had been no proof which would sustain a jury verdict on any of the elements of that cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.776" offset="943211">That was hotly disputed, as you might imagine, by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.145" offset="956691">On the appeal, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on a different basis, and they held as a matter of law that the allegations made in the federal action did not constitute a violation of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.155" offset="1012697">After they received their NOV judgment, the bank asserted that judgment as collateral estoppel and res judicata in the state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.510" offset="1046134">That issue was litigated, pretrial, a jury verdict ensued after a trial on the merits, and that particular issue, the res judicata effect of the federal judgment, was fully and fairly litigated in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.604" offset="5258536">This Court has considered on a number of occasions the question of preclusion of nonparties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.126" offset="5292599">Due process, if it requires anything, requires that a party, to be precluded, has had an opportunity in the earlier litigation to bring forth his arguments and to present the evidence that he wants to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.120" offset="5352576">There is simply no evidence in this record that the trustee was represented at all in the earlier federal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.075" offset="5392387">In fact, the only basis that the Court of Appeals gives for its decision affirming the injunction as to trustee is its indication that the trustee should have joined in the earlier federal action, and by doing that he would have had the opportunity to litigate his issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.889" offset="5467724">I find it very difficult indeed to understand the argument that the other petitioners, the parent corporation and the shareholders, are barred because they split a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.030" offset="5520282">That is the basis for res judicata applying at all to them, and yet the argument is made that the trustee is barred because he did not do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.818" offset="5555391">At all times the trustee had pending in state court the legal issues that he desired to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.741" offset="5583081">They were pending prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.193" offset="5596874">When the adjudication of bankruptcy occurred, the trustee took that property as any other property of the bankrupt corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.947" offset="5623936">There was never any indication in the federal action that the trustee's interests were at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.351" offset="5649536">They sought no damages on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.238" offset="5665105">The defendant in fact in that case suggested that the trustee and the bankrupt corporation would be the only ones who had been damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.225" offset="5696975">The trial court continually denied that motion, denied that issue, and let the case go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.247" offset="5729158">The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals also discusses what it deems the concept of privity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.501" offset="5754131">Although this Court has taught in its earlier decisions that that is an ambiguous term in itself, I must argue that there are no factors which could support a finding of privity in this case, even if you assume that is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.745" offset="5815153">There was no direct relationship between the trustee and the other plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.832" offset="5831453">That had been severed by the adjudication of bankruptcy, and if you look to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision on this issue, you will note that they make an incorrect factual assumption, that is, that this federal action was pending at the time of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.758" offset="5895192">The federal action plaintiffs made no attempt to represent the trustee, sought no damages on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.097" offset="5928524">Had they recovered in that action, there would have been no recovery for the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.149" offset="5944720">In fact, the filing of the action itself is an indication that the interests were different in that they were there pursuing a claim of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.857" offset="5983590">As to the remaining plaintiffs, even if this Court determines that the full faith and credit action is not a bar to the injunction, I would suggest that the injunction is simply too great an intrusion into the state court system to be justified by the circumstances presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.918" offset="6063838">The argument has been made that the issues in state court could have been litigated in the earlier federal judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.507" offset="6090170">That, I would submit to the Court, might be a justification for an injunction in an early stage of the state court proceeding, before substantial judicial resources had been invested by the state court, but here, where the state court has heard the case on the merits, a nine-day trial has ensued, substantial state court judicial resources have been consumed in the litigation, I would suggest that there would have to be a direct conflict between that earlier federal judgment and the current state action in order to justify in intrusion that great into the state court system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.519" offset="10062245">We do not agree, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.771" offset="10071231">We think that the interests of federalism and comity and those principles, those underlying policies were indeed addressed by Congress when it enacted the relitigation exception in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.363" offset="10133611">Congress opted for a choice of a policy position that it was an inadequate remedy to protect a federal judgment and to preserve the fruits to the victor in the federal judgment, that this federal judgment form nothing more than the basis of a plea of res judicata in a state court which could or could not be reviewed ultimately here under considerations which would show that they involved matters of public interest as well as the private interest of the litigants, and where matters of public interest in those circumstances prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.269" offset="10269239">Now, as far as the extent to which the proceedings had gone in the state court, as we point out in our brief, these matters happened on the eve of the state trial, and we were faced with a new state judge, a denial of motion for summary of judgment a couple of weeks, three weeks before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.765" offset="10351159">On three days before trial we urged, and this is all in the record, we urged the state trial court to postpone the trial, to give us a continuance, and to present an interlocutory review of the res judicata question to the Supreme Court of Alabama under a procedure which is similar to 28 USCA 1292(b), the interlocutory appeal federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.547" offset="10446349">Alabama has a similar... that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.215" offset="10457007">So, this was on a Friday, and the trial began on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.553" offset="10470382">We urged indeed that our counterclaim in the state court be considered as having been barred by the early federal judgment just as the plaintiff's claim was barred, and that summary judgments be issued on those bases, so that that matter could be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.313" offset="10529419">We were not the ones pressing for a trial, which ultimately ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.681" offset="10546869">We had to pursue the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.383" offset="10553660">We had to present all of our defenses in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.550" offset="10562333">We couldn't simply singleshot the preclusion matter and ignore the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.954" offset="10583962">So, that is the background, and at the earliest opportunity, when it was apparent that the state court was not going to grant appropriate and proper preclusive effect to the earlier federal judgment, that we sought the injunction and obtained it in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.165" offset="10652821">But as the court below points out, the relitigation statute doesn't apply at particular points in time, and indeed it couldn't, because let us suppose that the state court, trial court agreed with us and the federal court about the preclusive effect of the earlier federal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.512" offset="10738189">That could be reversed on appeal by the state appellate court, and then we would be back in the same situation where the injunction was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.434" offset="10769850">We think, moreover, Mr. Chief Justice, that an attempt to get the Alabama court to grant proper preclusive effect was if not required, certainly indicated by the judicial gloss which the federal courts have placed on 2283 since 1948, where they indicate in essence that the fact that Congress has accorded this authority and this jurisdiction on the federal court doesn't mean that it comes into play automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.423" offset="10901820">And for that reason as well, it was felt that it was necessary to give the state courts an opportunity to decide this question, and indeed, as I have mentioned a few moments ago, matters of practicality and prudence also dictated that, because if we did not present the res judicata and collateral estoppel defense to the state court, but simply sought an injunction in the federal court, and if we got it in the federal court and it was reversed on appeal, or if we didn't get it in the federal court, in the federal district court, then we really would have waived the opportunity to assert that defense in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.231" offset="11065034">So, there are all kinds of reasons why it has to be, the defense has to be asserted in the state proceeding, but none of this undermines or can undermine the authority that Congress conferred on federal district courts to issue injunction against state proceedings to protect and effectuate their judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.429" offset="12393830">Indeed, two of the cases we cite in our brief, the Silcox case and the Brown against McCormick cases, in both of those cases, the matters had gotten to the appellate courts before the federal injunction issued, and in one of the cases the federal appellate court commended the parties for going that far in seeking to get the state to give the proper preclusive effect to the earlier federal judgment before seeking relief in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.448" offset="12505948">In answer to Justice White's question about the ACL case, that case as we understand it, and we have discussed it at some length in our brief, as we understand it, went on the point that because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the federal district court had not decided earlier the question of whether there could be a federal injunction against... a state injunction against... excuse me, a federal injunction against picketing, and that simply there was a withholding of jurisdiction according to the majority analysis, Your Honor, and I believe Justice Brennan dissented, feeling that there had been a broader issue than just the withdrawal of jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.631" offset="12710643">But the point of the decision was that the federal district court had not decided the matter that was later decided by the state court which issued the injunction, and therefore the relitigation exception did not come into play.</text>
