            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="186524">Mr. Perez, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward J. Perez</label>
            <text syncTime="13.058" offset="198644">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.093" offset="210870">This case is before you today as a result of a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.329" offset="235738">In that decision the Ninth Circuit held that the City of Los Angeles may not limit access to its public utility poles, public utility ducts, by way of an option process, if space permits further construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="304911">Before I commence argument, Your Honors, I would like to state the key points of my argument and then briefly summarize the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.647" offset="341064">This case is really only about digging up streets and hanging coaxial cable on utility poles.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.885" offset="370008">Point number two, our process is not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="383905">It has evolved over two decades' worth of experience, in approximately 7,000 other situations in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="418073">The proper First Amendment analysis is the third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.112" offset="430925">We believe it is under the public forum doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.714" offset="445345">The public forum doctrine says that in a non-public forum mode, nondiscriminatory regulations need only be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.487" offset="488395">Very briefly, Your Honors, the key facts of this case are, the City, pursuant to California state law, requires a cable operator to obtain a franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.462" offset="532280">The City awards these franchises through a competitive bid process, and we select only one franchisee.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.917" offset="562164">In October of 1982, the City of Los Angeles opened up the South Central area for a competitive bid process.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.987" offset="594452">Preferred Communications, the respondent in this case, did not participate in that competitive bid process.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.660" offset="621097">Instead, Preferred Communications informally requested that the City grant them a franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.897" offset="650040">The City denied that informal request, and Preferred Communications filed a lawsuit in the district court in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.337" offset="679820">They alleged antitrust violations, and they also alleged First Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.305" offset="699673">The City of Los Angeles filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12-B-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.125" offset="730915">We allege they failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a claim upon which relief may be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.278" offset="755575">The district court dismissed... granted on motions the district court found there is no constitutional right to construct the cable television system on government property without government permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.955" offset="810223">Preferred Communications appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.590" offset="820777">The Ninth Circuit sustained the motion with regard to the antitrust claims, but reversed on First Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.244" offset="851392">We then appealed to this Court, and this Court denied our appeal but granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.750" offset="885456">The first point, Your Honors, is that we really are dealing with the construction of a cable system.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.403" offset="908026">The respondent has raised many issues which may be important and may sometime have to be decided by this Court, but today the only issue is, do they have a constitutional right to construct the system on government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.097" offset="966853">This is not a case--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="242.122" offset="1114915">So, a good share of the system will occupy public property?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward J. Perez</label>
            <text syncTime="248.526" offset="1140515">The majority of the system will be on public property, Your Honor, and if it's not, the fact that it's on city rights of ways, we control the rights of ways so I don't think the fact that a private pole involved really is important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.000" offset="1198403">So, this is not a case, Your Honors, where you have to consider cable with newspapers, that's not really an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.237" offset="1223376">What's at issue is constructing a system for South Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.522" offset="1240512">This is not a case where the Court needs to decide the First Amendment rights of cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.676" offset="1261201">We concede that they have First Amendment rights, so that's not really at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.580" offset="1284816">This case really isn't, when you stop and look at the situation, a case where you need to decide content regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.935" offset="1318148">The Ninth Circuit looked at our RFP and our process, and they found that it was not unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.273" offset="1347510">So, the issue would be, if any, was it applied discriminatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.160" offset="1367049">Well, it was virtually impossible to do that because Preferred did not participate in our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.481" offset="1388365">So, how could we discriminate against your viewpoint?</text>

            <text syncTime="348.237" offset="1539353">However, we would probably not award another application unless it was justified, but that avenue is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.843" offset="1565789">We have a non-exclusive franchise, and our bid process says, if you look at 58-200, it says that in each process you must select the highest responsible bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.216" offset="1607271">So, in the process you select one, but you can have a subsequent process, and it's up to the applicant who initiates the subsequent process to say yes, the City of Los Angeles, one cable company's not doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.482" offset="4808421">Number one, they might not be very smart and they actually think they can't compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.951" offset="4822213">Number two, they might want to get in just to make sure that they have a right to construct and they will approach... and this is happening across the country... they'll approach the existing franchisee, perhaps merge, and we'll get a big cash settlement out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.092" offset="4874772">That is a motivation for competition in many situations, and cable companies across this country are selling out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.995" offset="4898386">You've seen this selling out process, which is one consideration the City takes when they regulate cable, is that we try to make sure that this sales differential, the premium that is being paid on to the new cable company is not placed in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.040" offset="4966618">However, that process, rate regulation, is now being phased out so we probably will not be able to do that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.111" offset="4990860">But we have substantial governmental interests, assuming as we have that cable is a natural monopoly and that there will only be one cable company in there, multiplicity... pardon me, information diversity is a key issue which was discussed very thoroughly by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.239" offset="5059405">In the House report, pages 30 to 38, they balanced the interest, the First Amendment rights of the interest of the cable operator and the viewing subscriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.678" offset="5105172">And viewing subscriber is the paramount person under consideration, as this Court has held in other cases, and that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.784" offset="5133593">If Preferred Communications wishes to communicate over cable, we're not preventing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.855" offset="5153864">Look at Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.538" offset="5156581">We referenced that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.321" offset="5163686">They have a microwave system in their cable programming, without utilizing government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.359" offset="5187928">Why should we allow Preferred to come in and utilize government property?</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.762" offset="5201511">We should be able to manage our property in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.964" offset="5214259">We acquired that property through eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.566" offset="5224708">We have a fiduciary duty to protect the interest for all citizens, the poor and the rich, and we know that cable companies will not wire the poor areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.338" offset="5263787">They are going to wire the affluent areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.838" offset="5269848">That's another substantial governmental interest in our process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.624" offset="5280924">It's a very reasonable process, and this Court, in Perry, says alternative channels are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.878" offset="5301926">So, in addition we have these access channels for preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.830" offset="5313733">They really want to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.598" offset="5320839">They really want to speak over cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.165" offset="5327108">They can get one leased access channel and have the same amount of time as CBS, ABC or NBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.919" offset="5350096">So, that leads me to one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.121" offset="5354902">Is constructing a cable system a First Amendment expression?</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.905" offset="5370053">Do they really want to run the business, or do they want to express themselves over cable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.274" offset="5387503">They can do it over cable through the access channel, through microwave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.511" offset="5404535">They can have some [inaudible] systems set up, low powered TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.297" offset="5419686">There are many, many ways for them to speak over the medium they claim they wish to speak on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.284" offset="5439539">We are not preventing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.501" offset="5444450">What we are doing is regulating our right of ways in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.319" offset="5459706">Finally, as I mentioned, we really don't believe a trial is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.807" offset="5481648">There is ample information before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.114" offset="5742873">When Mr. Perez first began, he like all of us do, as we try to phrase the exact question that was answered by the Ninth Circuit, said it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.236" offset="5787386">He said the question was whether or not Preferred was entitled to build its cable system on public utility poles and in public utility context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.293" offset="5831585">He didn't say anything about public property at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.979" offset="5842347">It was only later when he said, he's saying that there is no constitutional right to build on public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.049" offset="5866693">Now, when the Ninth Circuit posed the question it said, you know, is there a right to limit this thing, and it used in there, in its phrase,</text>
