            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135156">We will hear arguments first this morning in Offshore Logistics, Incorporated v. Tallentire.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.570" offset="169429">Mr. Jones, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="12.241" stopTime="209.836">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="12.241" offset="184057">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case arises from the crash of a helicopter on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="218748">The crash occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 35 miles from land.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.131" offset="239646">All persons on board were killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.317" offset="248423">The operator of the helicopter, Offshore Logistics, conceded in the District Court that it is liable for damages under the Federal Death on the High Seas Act, which is known by its acronym DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.475" offset="297011">That statute provides for the recovery of pecuniary damages, but it does not allow the award of nonpecuniary or sentimental damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.266" offset="336194">The case is here because the Plaintiffs contend and the Court of Appeals held that Offshore Logistics additionally is liable for sentimental damages under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.722" offset="381961">The theory of the Plaintiffs and that of the Court of Appeals is that state law may be invoked and applied as a means of supplementing DOHSA and enlarging the recoveries for wrongful death on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.833" offset="442460">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.666" offset="449775">Our position is that DOHSA is exclusive, that the availability of a uniform maritime rule of recovery makes the parallel of supplemental enforcement of state law both unnecessary and inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.093" offset="507453">The Court of Appeals rejected our position because, it held, that enforcement of state law is required by what it called the clear mandate of Section 7 of DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.416" offset="556772">That holding defines the core issue in this case, that is, whether Section 7 actually does mandate enforcement of state law on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.708" offset="601912">We submit that Plaintiffs cannot prevail in this case unless Section 7 affirmatively directs federal admiralty courts to enforce state wrongful death statutes on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.782" offset="650186">We further submit that Section 7 issues no such directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.420" offset="668785">Before I turn to the construction of Section 7, let me begin by assuming that for purposes of argument that Section 7 is merely neutral, that it neither prohibits nor requires the enforcement of state law on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.647" offset="741719">In this event, the proper role of state law will be left for judicial determination in accordance with the governing principles of admiralty, and there can be no serious question about the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.705" offset="793964">Federal courts would not be required to enforce state law on the high seas, and they would not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.943" offset="818833">The courts would not be required to enforce state law because admiralty is a federal common law jurisdiction in which state law does not operate of its own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.233" offset="864077">This Court has refused to apply state law even in cases arising on the territorial waters and involving issues on which Congress has not spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.374" offset="904619">It follows a fortiori that admiralty courts have no obligation to enforce state law in cases arising not in the territorial waters but on the high seas and involving issues on which Congress already has spoken by providing a uniform maritime rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="216.071" offset="999391">One marine league, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.338" offset="1004407">Well, how far is that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="218.090" offset="1007437">I understand that's just a little bit more than three geographic miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.911" offset="1030738">I think it is the equivalent of three nautical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.696" offset="1045889">I think the purpose of DOHSA was to define the territorial boundary of the United States or to conform with that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.020" offset="1095208">Not only would federal admiralty courts not be required to enforce state law in those circumstances, it is clear that they would not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.542" offset="1129272">The purpose of the constitutional framers in conferring admiralty jurisdiction on the federal courts was to ensure the preservation and development of a coherent and uniform body of maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.934" offset="1182875">Admiralty law historically has been shaped and governed by this constitutional policy of maritime uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.706" offset="1217879">From time to time the courts have borrowed from state law in order to fill a void in maritime law, but that practice has marked the limit of admiralty's tolerance for nonuniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.347" offset="1264482">Admiralty courts do not offer diversity when there is a national admiralty rule already at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.286" offset="1292276">This is especially true on the high seas where the essential features of an exclusive federal jurisdiction are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.273" offset="1324145">The Plaintiffs appear to suggest that this constitutional policy of maritime uniformity covers only duties of care and that there is no federal interest in uniform remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.600" offset="1381510">It is by no means clear that the decision below contemplates only the enforcement of state remedies and not of state duties of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.507" offset="1421112">But be that as it may, the Plaintiffs' argument is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.542" offset="1437308">One of the earliest cases stressing the need for maritime uniformity, Chelentis v. Luckenbach, specifically involved the question of remedy, and in that case this Court held that a state remedy of full indemnification would not and could not be substituted for the more limited general maritime remedy of maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.975" offset="1526960">The doctrine of maritime uniformity plainly embraces remedies as well as duties of care.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.962" offset="1558934">Well, are you saying that would be true even if Congress intended that state remedies apply?</text>

            <text syncTime="369.538" offset="1613269">Though certainly it doesn't look very neutral on its face, and I think that's the problem you have along with the legislative history.</text>

          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="377.577" stopTime="473.187">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="377.577" offset="1645452">--Well, our basic submission here is that Section 7 does not command the enforcement of state law on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.183" offset="1683799">Let us turn to the language of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.969" offset="1694980">It provides, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="393.087" offset="1707414">"the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected. "</text>
            <text syncTime="401.192" offset="1739910">Now.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.458" offset="1744926">I agree that at first blush this language may appear to be suggestive, but the closer one looks, the less meaningful it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.714" offset="1777945">To say that the provisions of state law are not affected is not to say that state law can, let alone that it must, be enforced on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.254" offset="1820158">And this is no mere gramatical quibble.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.854" offset="1830503">In Section 4 of DOHSA Congress expressly directed federal admiralty courts to enforce foreign law on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.478" offset="1869060">If Congress had intended to issue the same kind of directive with respect to state law, it would have used similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.399" offset="1900720">It would have specified in the same manner as in Section 4 that rights of action for wrongful death on the high seas based upon state law may be maintained in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.725" offset="1950039">But Congress did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.025" offset="1959234">Instead, the language of Section 7 is, as Representative Goodykoontz observed on the floor of the House, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="465.533" offset="1997269">"not unlike Mohammed's coffin, suspended between heaven and earth, having no application to anything in particular. "</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="473.187" stopTime="481.876">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="473.187" offset="2027884">Well, why should we take Representative Goodykoontz's word as opposed to Congressman Mann's word who apparently drafted the thing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="481.876" stopTime="519.334">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="481.876" offset="2062575">Well, I think that there is a lot to be said about what Representative Mann had in mind, but let me first point out that for 60 years following the enactment of DOHSA, this language of Section 7 has been treated by all leading admiralty commentators as nothing more than a saving clause, as providing nothing more than that state law may be used where federal law, where the federal remedy does not apply.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="519.334" stopTime="521.201">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="519.334" offset="2212413">Like the saving to suitors clause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="521.201" stopTime="653.453">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="521.201" offset="2219936">Well, the saving to suitors clause basically is a provision that permits the use of a state forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.908" offset="2258702">The saving to suitors clause is somewhat different from this provision, but I think what people understood Section 7 as providing is that where the federal remedy does not apply, the state remedies may still be enforced in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.136" offset="2335607">Now, it is true that recently the lower court and a handful of other district courts, out of apparent dissatisfaction of DOHSA's limitation of recovery to pecuniary damages, have sought to supplement it with remedies borrowed from state law, but in doing so, they have disregarded this Court's instruction in Mobil Oil v. Higginbotham that, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="576.020" offset="2439156">"Congress did not limit DOHSA beneficiaries to recovery of their pecuniary losses in order to encourage the creation of nonpecuniary supplements. "</text>
            <text syncTime="586.209" offset="2479907">"And the lower court's departure from Higginbotham is not justified by their vague and cryptic language of Section 7. "</text>
            <text syncTime="594.814" offset="2514389">And I don't think it's justified by the legislative history either, either of DOHSA as a whole or Section 7 in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.170" offset="2547825">The legislative history of DOHSA as a whole, as set forth in the committee reports, reveals that Congress intended to establish a uniform and exclusive remedy for wrongful death on the high seas, and the bill's sponsor, Representative Montague, explained during floor debate, Section 7 was merely put in out of abundant caution to calm the minds of those who think that rights within the territorial waters will be usurped by the national law.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.225" offset="2671959">Now, to be sure, this statement was made before Section 7 was amended on the floor of the House, but that amendment, Representative Mann's amendment, would not have the effect of defeating the original and expressly stated legislative purposes of uniformity and exclusivity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="653.453" stopTime="664.761">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="653.453" offset="2748968">Would that be true even if he intended to alter the text in the way that his statements indicated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="664.761" stopTime="870.692">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="664.761" offset="2794108">Well, Justice O'Connor, I think no parsing of the floor debate can make crystal clear what either Representative Mann's intention was or the intention of the House as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.718" offset="2837994">Representative Mann offered his amendment out of a confusion of motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.854" offset="2858474">He wanted to ensure that state law would continue to apply in all territorial waters, whether or not they were within one marine league of shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.478" offset="2897030">He also wanted to provide for concurrent federal and state court Jurisdiction over actions arising under DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.899" offset="2930676">Now, those appear to have been his dominant motives, and they do not bear upon this case one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.553" offset="2957321">Now, Representative Mann's third motive, if indeed he had a third motive, was to preserve existing state court jurisdiction over actions predicated upon state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.194" offset="3003923">But what was that existing state court jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="721.412" offset="3020746">Representative Mann himself, during the debate on an earlier version of this bill, stated explicitly that state courts have no jurisdiction over accidents on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.655" offset="3073723">Now, the plaintiffs appear to suggest, and a theme that runs through the decision below, is that the purpose of the amendment was to codify the holding of the Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.778" offset="3118235">But Representative Mann himself never said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.915" offset="3134745">And what the court below and the Plaintiffs overlook is that the Hamilton did not approve a direct action for wrongful death under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.771" offset="3178212">The holding of the Hamilton is that a federal admiralty court, in the absence of a national admiralty rule, when Congress has not spoken, will apply state wrongful death law, but only in a special set of circumstances, only when the owner of the vessel has invoked the protection of admiralty by initiating a special federal statutory proceeding to limit liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.909" offset="3302764">The congressional reports, the committee reports on DOHSA noted the narrowness of this holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.265" offset="3332126">They stated, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="801.365" offset="3340589">"The right to affirmative action in the admiralty against ship or owner has never been sustained by the Supreme Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="811.387" offset="3380609">And represented Igoe repeated this point during the floor debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.958" offset="3402970">The general understanding at the time, as this Court noted in its decision in Moragne, was that state law did not apply beyond state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.996" offset="3443094">Insofar as deaths on the high seas was concerned, there simply was no existing state court jurisdiction, and there was no direct action for wrongful death under state law to be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.906" offset="3498683">Finally, floor debate on Representative Mann's amendment was repeatedly punctuated by the assertion made by several members of the House that adoption of the amendment would have no effect on the exclusivity of the new federal remedy on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.404" offset="3580707">One may assume, indeed, one must assume that the amendment was adopted at least in part in reliance upon those representations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.163" offset="4691747">The Court has explicitly identified that anomaly in Higginbotham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.067" offset="4715362">Let me address one more point with respect to the wording of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.019" offset="4735215">Plaintiffs point out that that wording before its amendment would have prohibited application of state law on the high seas by what they call negative implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.176" offset="4775757">If so, the amendment did nothing more than remove a negatively implied prohibition from one provision of the bill without substituting in its place a positive directive to enforce state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.984" offset="4831032">Consequently, even if the amendment could be portrayed as a retreat from an original intention of actually requiring federal exclusivity on the high seas, it was at most only a partial and tactical retreat to a posture of congressional neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.298" offset="4904279">If adoption of the amendment means anything at all with respect to the role of state law on the high seas, it means no more than that Congress, having been advised that the courts would hold the federal remedy to be exclusive, whether or not Section 7 was amended, decided simply to leave the matter to the courts without itself either prohibiting or requiring enforcement of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.031" offset="5015247">Now, as I said earlier, if the matter is left to the courts, it is clear what the courts would decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.554" offset="5049311">The extension of a hodgepodge of differing and conflicting state laws under the high seas would make a mockery of the notion of maritime uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.861" offset="5098526">As Judge Jolly said in his somewhat reluctant concurring opinion below, application of state law would make a mess in more than a few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.752" offset="5142098">It would make a mess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.802" offset="5150353">Application of state law on the high seas would meet with no apparent limiting principle to constrain or define its applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.994" offset="5195074">We would be faced with the prospect, the rather bizarre prospect, of Kansas law applying in the Persian Gulf or Arizona law applying on the North Sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.618" offset="5241572">Such extraterritorial applications of state law is patently anomalous, and even if, even if state law, the adoption of state law were limited to remedies, that would renew tensions and discrepancies that result from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively federal maritime subsidy concepts, precisely the tensions and discrepancies that this Court tried to bring to an end in its decision in Moragne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.625" offset="5381589">But in fact, the question of engrafting state remedies, of engrafting supplemental remedies onto DOHSA already has been decided, assuming that state law is not mandated by Congress because this Court in its decision in Higginbotham held that state law... I'm sorry, that DOHSA will not be supplemented or displaced even by a uniform, judge-made remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.929" offset="5506872">That was the decision in Higginbotham, and the basis for that decision was that federal common law power of rulemaking permits federal courts to devise general maritime rules, would not be exercised when Congress already has provided a uniform maritime rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.058" offset="5583358">That reasoning applies here with even greater force because the borrowing of state law not only would displace DOHSA but introduce widespread disuniformity as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.048" offset="5635290">For these reasons, we submit that the governing principles of admiralty, including in particular the constitutional policy of maritime uniformity, preclude supplemental enforcement of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.514" offset="6233180">No, it has not, but to the best of my knowledge and research, neither has that position ever been advanced to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.351" offset="6264527">But to come back to Section 7 and what happened to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.738" offset="6286052">The unsuccessful bills sought to be exclusive just like the Petitioners would have the Court construe those today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.476" offset="6313011">Then in the 1920 bill this language was offered to the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.081" offset="6339447">The provisions of Section 7, the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.603" offset="6381556">Now, the act that's before you stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.739" offset="6394095">The one that was before the House went on to say</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.293" offset="6416247">"as to causes of action accruing within the territorial limits within the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.863" offset="6434532">as to causes of action accruing within the territorial waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.399" offset="6452714">That would have resulted, perhaps, in a result such as the Petitioners argue for because if DOHSA doesn't affect remedies created by state law as to causes of action accruing within the territorial limits of any state, then maybe DOHSA does supplant and preempt state created remedies which, by reason of The Hamilton, would apply on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.751" offset="6570160">But that's what Mr. Mann's amendment took out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.220" offset="6583953">He took out</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.405" offset="6588759">"as to causes of action accruing within the territorial limits of any state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.059" offset="6611329">So now it just says DOHSA won't affect state created remedies, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.729" offset="6642049">No longer is that savings clause limited to the territorial waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.449" offset="6664932">That savings clause is all-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.334" offset="6684472">Boiled down to its simplest terms, the Petitioners' position is that state death acts, which this Court once held in The Hamilton do afford a remedy on the high seas, no longer apply there because DOHSA has preempted them, but the very statute on which they... on which the Petitioner relies saves whatever force state statutes have, and you have already held in The Hamilton that state death acts do apply on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.776" offset="6830235">Now, we can argue this case for the remainder of the hour, and we have briefed hundreds of pages, but that's what it boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.446" offset="6864926">The Petitioners say that the statute preempts state death remedies on the high seas, and we say the statute saves them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.949" offset="6978924">In the Nygaard decision out of the Ninth Circuit, which is the case with which the Tallentire decision, our case, conflicts, the Ninth Circuit didn't even cite Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.209" offset="7031900">There was a line of older cases, most exemplary of which is Wilson v. Transocean Airlines in which the District Court I think for the Southern District of New York did address the matter of Section 7 and called it simply an innocuous change in language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.253" offset="7104103">I don't think it's an innocuous change in language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.019" offset="7115179">I think that's a little shallow to approach this, and The Harrisburg was the law from 1874 until you decided the Moragne case, and everybody thought that The Harrisburg precluded a federal death action in admiralty, and you did not let that erroneous view preclude you from reaching a just decision in the Moragne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.634" offset="7209638">And I would not hold to the view that old error is good error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.455" offset="7228968">Nor would I hold to the view that error is somehow sanctified by the universality of its acceptance, and I think this is a good opportunity for the Court to straighten out the error that has persisted if such it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.532" offset="7289259">However, the error has not been universal because we cited the Safir case and a number of other cases from the lower courts which hold the opposite view, Rairigh v. Erlbeck, etcetera, which hold the opposite view, and that is that Section 7 does indeed say the state created remedies on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.009" offset="7355192">Mr. Jones' argument proceeds from the assumption, I think, that one federal statute in a field preempts all state action in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.419" offset="7412766">Alexander Hamilton, writing in "The Federalist" certainly would not have shared that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.073" offset="7435440">According to Mr. Hamilton, federal law is exclusive only in three situations: first of all, where the Constitution in express terms grants an exclusive authority to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.565" offset="7493327">That's not the... to the federal government, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.333" offset="7504403">That certainly is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.135" offset="7511613">The second case where the federal government... federal legislation, rather excludes state legislation, is where the Constitution expressly grants a power, though perhaps not explicitly exclusive to the federal government, and also says that the state shall not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.763" offset="7586114">That is certainly not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.865" offset="7594578">The third situation is, according to Mr. Hamilton, where the Constitution granted an authority to the Union to which a similar authority in the states would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.542" offset="7657272">Let me remind you that Justice Charles Evans Hughes, writing in the case of Just v. Chambers said uniformity is required only when the legislation... when the essential features of an exclusive federal jurisdiction are involved, but as admiralty takes cognizance of maritime torts, there is no repugnancy to its characteristic features, either in permitting recovery for wrongful death or in allowing compensation for a wrong to the living to be obtained from a tortfeasor's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.083" offset="7803453">Chief Justice Hughes echoed the very words that Mr. Hamilton used in Just v. Chambers with direct reference to a state death action applied on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.974" offset="7850996">Now, that... those were navigable waters of a state, I'll grant you, but it's perfectly consistent with what you did in The Hamilton, and if the application of state law on the high seas... rather, on the navigable waters of a state is not repugnant, then I see no conceptual reason why the application of state law on the high seas should be any different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.243" offset="8276060">Now, at sea has a very broad reach, and I am only... I don't, I don't have any reservations about the applicability of state law in the waters overlying the shelf and perhaps in waters more distant than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.383" offset="8632684">Let me remind you that no one in the Higginbotham case contended that state law government that was a straight conflict between DOHSA and the general maritime death action announced in Moragne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.191" offset="8687855">You held in the Higginbotham that DOHSA is the national admiralty rule and supplants Moragne, but you also said in Higginbotham... beg your pardon, in Moragne, in Moragne, DOHSA,</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.919" offset="11966745">So somebody points out to the king that when all of the children had whole loaves of bread there was uniformity, and the king answered, that's right, but the only uniformity that I like in my kingdom is the uniformity that comes from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.548" offset="12033305">And in a word, that is the Petitioners' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.250" offset="12052113">And I don't think that history is going to be any kinder with that position than they have been with Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="2994.010" offset="12111149">Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.479" offset="12120972">It seems to me that the Plaintiffs fail to recognize that admiralty law is different from conventional interstate commerce law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.202" offset="12171963">State statute do not apply of their own force in admiralty, and preemption does not require a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.392" offset="12204668">The decision in Chelentis, for example, illustrates this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.344" offset="12224521">Uniformity in Chelentis is provided by judge-made rules, not by a congressional prohibition, express or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.300" offset="12260256">Decisions like Chelentis and Kossick, Pope &amp; Talbot all stand for the proposition that the availability of a uniform national maritime rule itself precludes enforcement of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.126" offset="12315636">There need be no congressional prohibition, express or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.095" offset="12331518">Let me address a moment the question of The Hamilton again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.665" offset="12349804">Mr. Justice Stevens read an extract from that opinion by Justice Holmes, and that opinion is divided into two parts, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.806" offset="12394317">In the first part Justice Holmes established that state law is valid, that the state law in question was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.443" offset="12424828">But then he went on to consider the question whether that law would be applied in admiralty, and one of the crucial considerations that he discusses in that connection was that this was a case brought in admiralty to limit liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.287" offset="12484283">It was a special federal statutory proceeding to limit liability, and The Hamilton does not stand Generally for the proposition that state wrongful death statutes could be enforced in admiralty in direct actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.212" offset="12535900">And that is what the congression... the committee reports pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.498" offset="12549066">Moreover, the first part of The Hamilton may well not have survived the decisions in Jensen and Chelentis that followed it by about ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.306" offset="12592325">After those decisions, the Supreme Court confronted once again the question of whether a state wrongful death statute would be applied, this time in territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.495" offset="12633076">This is the Garcia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.447" offset="12644883">And in that case, the Court said that because in territorial waters the event was maritime and local in character, state law could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.921" offset="12686784">If The Hamilton had decided more generally that state wrongful death statutes applied on the high seas, there would have been no need for the maritime but local in character ruling of Garcia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.460" offset="12732968">Moreover, DOHSA was enacted in the context of Jenson and Chelentis, and in that context, the members of the House recognized that the Supreme Court at that time would hold the federal rule to be exclusive no matter how Section 7 was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.374" offset="12812589">With that in mind, Congress amended Section 7, leaving it to the courts under what it assumed to be the governing doctrine of Jensen and Chelentis, of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.998" offset="12855117">At bottom, it seems to me that the Plaintiffs want to do away with admiralty as a special, separate federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.139" offset="12899629">They want to assimilate admiralty to the law of coastal states and the adjacent platforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.460" offset="12924916">But regardless of the merits of such a suggestion, it just wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.262" offset="12944142">There are enormous choice of law problems on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.649" offset="12961696">Choice of law problems are obviously far more difficult there than in the territorial waters where an event actually occurs within the boundaries of an individual state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.922" offset="13006836">This Court in Lauritzen v. Larsen listed seven factors that bear upon the choice of law in the high seas, even when it's only a matter of choosing which nation's law would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.181" offset="13059812">If we were to extend the separate laws of 50 states on the high seas as well, the question of choice of law would be enormously complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.120" offset="13091577">I have nothing further, Your Honor.</text>
