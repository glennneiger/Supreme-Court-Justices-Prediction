            <text syncTime="62.537" offset="387325">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.536" offset="399341">This case involves one narrow question, whether Congress has waived the sovereign immunity of the United States to permit the addition of pre-judgment interest to Title VII attorneys' fee awards against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.844" offset="448556">In 1979, Respondent prevailed in his Title VII action against his employer, the Library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.700" offset="480008">The district court indicated at the time that it would award attorneys' fee to Respondent as the prevailing party, but it postponed entry of an order awarding those fees, deciding to await the decision of the Court of Appeals in a pending case, Copeland versus Marshall, which was expected to provide guidance on the calculation of a reasonable attorneys' fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.504" offset="551270">The Court of Appeals handed down its decision in Copeland almost a year later, in September 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.957" offset="573108">An additional year then passed before the district court, in November of 1981, issued an order awarding fees to Respondent for work that his attorney had performed three years earlier, in 1978 and early 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.000" offset="629219">In the part of the order that is specifically at issue here, the Court then added 30 percent on top of the basic fee award, representing 10 percent for each year of delay to compensate Respondent's attorney for the time that had passed between the date that he completed his work and the time of the fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.804" offset="700481">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed this award of what it acknowledged to be pre-judgment interest on Respondent's attorneys' fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.396" offset="730783">In the Court of Appeals' view, the Title VII attorneys' fee provision specifically waives that aspect of the Government's sovereign immunity that traditionally has shielded the United States from liability for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.985" offset="777177">The question is this case is whether that judgment was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.295" offset="790447">In our view, this issue is flatly resolved by the application of one of the oldest and most firmly settled principles covering the resolution of claims against the United States, what Judge Ginsburg in her dissenting opinion aptly called the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.274" offset="854290">As it has consistently been applied, this no interest rule provides that, even when Congress has explicitly waived the sovereign immunity of the United States and provided for the recovery of substantive claims against the Federal Government, interest cannot be awarded on top of those claims unless Congress in addition affirmatively considered the interest question and expressly indicated that interest should be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.375" offset="946763">It has never been considered enough that the statutory language could be read to support an award of interest or that making interest available might be consistent with the statutory purpose.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="984693">Mr. Rothfeld, if there were private litigants involved in a case like this, so we didn't have the Federal Government issue, if some form of pre-judgment interest were sought as against a private defendant employer, would it be payable as part of attorneys' fee, or as a part of damages in general, or how?</text>
            <text syncTime="244.652" offset="1115828">What's the theory of the recovery against the private litigant, do you think?</text>

            <text syncTime="248.683" offset="1131919">Pre-judgment interest on the attorneys' fee award would be characterized, I think, either as a component of that award... pre-judgment interest I think is generally viewed as a part of the damages and is generally termed pre-judgment interest on the damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.677" offset="1195972">So if it were a private defendant, in your view then it would be a part of attorneys' fee or costs in any event?</text>

            <text syncTime="276.625" offset="1243723">It would be interest... it's somewhat complicated, because the Title VII attorneys' fee provision defines the attorneys' fee as a part of the costs, and interest is generally not... pre-judgment interest is generally not awarded on costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.448" offset="1291057">But in our view, the pre-judgment interest would be awarded on the attorneys' fee, which would then be awarded as an element of the costs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="314.187" offset="1393980">As a part of the attorneys' fee, that's correct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="317.187" offset="1405996">That's correct, not as a part of the substantive back pay award, for example, that a plaintiff might be entitled to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.122" offset="1429715">So what we think is determinative here is this no interest rule which applies specifically to suits against the Federal Government, the sovereign immunity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.648" offset="1471825">And this rule has been applied with undiminished force for the better part of 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.786" offset="1492409">Early in the nineteenth century, it already was the usual practice of executive agencies not to pay interest on claims against the United States unless expressly directed to do so by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.970" offset="1533160">And in the years since then, this Court has repeatedly applied the no interest rule to bar claims for interest against the United States in literally dozens of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.841" offset="1580599">With the exception of narrow situations that are not applicable here, principally claims involving constitutional takings, the Court has applied the no interest rule to virtually every imaginable setting, in cases involving pre and post-judgment interest, cases involving liquidated claims and unliquidated claims, cases involving statutes and contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.910" offset="1656876">It has even applied the no interest rule without hesitation in cases in which the statutory language directed the United States to pay just compensation or full equitable relief, or other language that undoubtedly would make a private party liable for interest in the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.827" offset="1716540">Given all this, the rule is considerably more than a simple canon of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.699" offset="1740050">As a principle that has been applied consistently by this Court and by the lower Courts and by executive agencies for well over a century, the rule has taken on an institutional significance as something that tells Congress what it must do when it thinks it appropriate to make interest available against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.505" offset="1803266">There is little doubt that Congress is aware of the rule and has legislated with the rule in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.254" offset="1822283">When it has wanted interest to be available against the United States, Congress has said so expressly, and it has set out the circumstances in which interest should be paid with great specificity, setting out the rates at which it should be paid, what a plaintiff must do to protect his right to collect, and generally the conditions under which interest will be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.950" offset="1893023">It is against this background of consistent interpretation and action by the Court and by Congress that Respondent's claim for attorneys' fee under Title VII must be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.445" offset="1935028">The Court of Appeals itself acknowledged this background of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.881" offset="1952791">It recognized that the no interest rule would be fully applicable here in the absence of a sufficiently clear waiver by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.347" offset="1978600">But the Court of Appeals believed it found such a waiver in the Title VII attorneys' fee provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.062" offset="2001483">That's 41 U.S.C. 2000(e)(5)(K), which authorizes a Court to award an attorneys' fee to the prevailing party in Title VII litigation as a part of the costs, and then goes on to provided that the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.386" offset="2058744">In the Court of Appeals' view, this language, the "same as a private person" proviso, must have manifested Congress' clear intent to waive every aspect of the Government's sovereign immunity, necessarily including the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.333" offset="2110571">But in our view there are several fundamental problems with this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.487" offset="2131155">The first and most obvious involves what the Court believed the statutory language to mean, the "same as a private person" proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.531" offset="2163338">In fact, Congress placed that language in the statute not in an attempt to waive immunity in some complete way, but in 1964, at a time when the United States was not liable as a Title VII defendant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.979" offset="2213180">That language was put in the statute to provide that the United States would be liable for attorneys' fees in the same circumstances that private plaintiffs would be liable... excuse me... in which the United States acted as a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.818" offset="2256543">As this Court, however, has held time and again in its no interest rule decisions, this sort of threshold undifferentiated waiver of sovereign immunity is simply not enough to make the United States liable for an award of interest.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="545.640" offset="2319759">Mr. Rothfeld, would you comment to Attorney General Bell's memorandum that you opponent quotes toward the end of his brief?</text>

            <text syncTime="557.119" offset="2365735">Well, I think he would, Justice Stevens, and I think actually in a sense that supports our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.806" offset="2384439">At the same time that that memorandum was issued, the United States took the position in litigation in that very year that it was issued and in the years following while Attorney General Bell was in office that Title VII plaintiffs should not be entitled to attorneys' fees on their back pay awards against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.190" offset="2445983">So I think it must have been manifest to the Justice Department at the time that the no interest rule stood on a different footing, that it was ancillary to the basic Title VII litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.795" offset="2484435">And I think that has always been the view, that the no interest rule is something different from the substantive recovery that's authorized by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.003" offset="2585268">I had the impression from reading this that there'd probably been a change in the Government's position, but maybe I'm wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.189" offset="2605957">--Well, to my knowledge the first suggestion that attorneys' fees would be available, interest would be available on attorneys' fees against the Government, did not occur until 1980 in this Copeland versus Marshall decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.465" offset="2651097">So I think that there was no litigation about the matter prior to that time, at the time that the memorandum had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.104" offset="2673666">The only interest litigation, as I said, involved probably the more important question of whether plaintiffs were entitled to their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.430" offset="2702923">And in that area, the United States consistently has taken the positions, successfully I should add, that plaintiffs cannot obtain interest on their back pay awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.877" offset="3224745">The Respondent does not explicitly address that question in his brief and I shouldn't speak for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.499" offset="3247211">As I understand it, he attempts to distinguish this Court's no interest rule cases on the ground that they involve pre-judgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.792" offset="3288380">And I think it may be implicit in that that he acknowledges that post-judgment interest is only available when there's a specific statutory authority for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.008" offset="3321294">The usual approach, the usual distinction between pre and post-judgment interest is that pre-judgment interest is awarded as, as I suggested to Justice O'Connor, as an element of the damages, without a specific statutory authorization, except when the United States is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.440" offset="3382943">Post-judgment interest has always been created as something which is awarded separately by statute, and there are a host of federal statutes that address the availability, none of which make the United States liable for post-judgment interest on Title VII attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.527" offset="3439368">The United States was made liable as a Title VII defendant generally through the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which essentially extended the existing provisions of Title VII to suits against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.787" offset="3500390">It is that 1972 enactment, in combination with the basic attorneys' fees provision in Section 2000(e)(5)(K), that waives the Government's sovereign immunity and makes it liable for attorneys' fees awards at all to Title VII plaintiffs such as Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.781" offset="3560367">The fact that Section 2000(e)(5)(K) already contains the "same as a private person" proviso upon which the Court of Appeals primarily relied is a fortuity that really has no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.590" offset="3603625">And that language certainly was not intended to waive the Government's immunity in some sort of unusually complete way, as the Court of Appeals believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.852" offset="3628599">This leads to a second and more basic problem with the Court of Appeals' approach as viewed against the background of this no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.475" offset="3659110">Nothing in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, for that matter nothing in the 1964 version of Title VII, even reading that version as the Court of Appeals did, meets the test of clarity that this Court has set out in its repeated decisions applying this no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.076" offset="3725565">Title VII obviously does not mention interest on its face, let alone set out circumstances in which interest should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.432" offset="3759002">Nothing in the legislative history of the attorneys' fees provision, either in 1964 or the 1972 provisions that applied the '64 version to the Federal Government, adverts to interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.178" offset="3797977">And nothing in the broader and more general history or background of Title VII contains anything which is helpful to Respondent here, and that background sets out, as I think Attorney General Bell suggested in his memorandum, that Congress intended to remove sovereign immunity as a bar to federal employee plaintiffs bringing their claims of discrimination to court, and that background shows that Congress intended generally that the same types of relief be available to federal employee plaintiffs as to their private sector counterparts.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.869" offset="3916677">But again, as this Court has consistently held in cases interpreting the no interest rule, whatever other forms of relief Congress has authorized, the question whether interest will be available on that relief presents a separate inquiry to sovereign immunity that must be resolved by reference to the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.925" offset="3992954">It is for this reason, as I mentioned earlier, that the Court of Appeals have uniformly ruled that Title VII plaintiffs cannot obtain interest on their back pay awards against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.560" offset="4031511">Had Congress give any attention to the question, it is impossible to believe that it would have chosen to provide more favorable treatment to Title VII plaintiffs' attorneys than to Title &lt;VII&gt; [= VII] plaintiffs themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.572" offset="4079472">Finally, there is one what might be termed institutional problem with the Court of Appeals' analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.507" offset="4107266">By ignoring the requirement of an express statement of Congressional intent, the Court has effectively substituted its judgment for that of Congress in deciding when sovereign immunity should be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.160" offset="4145823">A look at the body of laws in which Congress has chosen to make interest available against the United States confirms that this is more than a theoretical interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.111" offset="4181663">When Congress has made interest available, it has set out very precisely the terms on which it should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.593" offset="4203606">The most recent of a long line of examples of this is probably last year's amendment to the Equal Access to Justice Act, a case that already contained at attorneys' fees provision strikingly similar to the one in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.119" offset="4245715">It makes the United States liable for fees to the same extent as a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.320" offset="4262538">Congress nevertheless found it necessary to expressly provide for awards of post-judgment interest under awards under the Equal Access to Justice Act and, in response to suggestions from the Comptroller General, Congress quite precisely limited the circumstances under which those awards would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.767" offset="4332337">It provided that they would only be available in cases in which the United States took an unsuccessful appeal, and even then only in cases... interest would only run from the date of the fee award through the day before the date of the Court of Appeals mandate of affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.183" offset="4385941">The Congress put these limitations in the statute for a very specific reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.667" offset="4403913">It wanted to assure that interest awards under the Equal Access to Justice Act would be in line with awards under similar statutes which contain generally similar limitations on when interest is available against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.396" offset="4450829">Congress did that in an attempt to prevent attorneys benefiting under the Equal Access to Justice Act and from obtaining unequally favorable treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.267" offset="4482280">The Court of Appeals decision, which finds a waiver of the no interest rule in a case where Congress failed to address the interest question and adopts an essentially ad hoc approach to the circumstances under which interest will be paid, throws into uncertainty an area that Congress obviously believed to be governed by very precise rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.119" offset="4553751">And the Court's decision essentially has that effect after the fact, by finding interest available under statutes Congress wrote when it knew the no interest rule to be in full force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.116" offset="4593666">In our view, that sort of decision simply cannot be reconciled with over a century of this Court's precedents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="1127.891" offset="4648837">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.092" offset="4661585">We agree that this case does present a single issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.294" offset="4674437">We would state it a little bit differently than the Government does, and that is it is whether a reasonable attorneys' fees award against a federal agency in a Title VII action may include compensation for delay in payment between the time services are rendered and the time of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.679" offset="4739952">The Government sees the entire case as dependent upon whether the word VII, or perhaps in its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.251" offset="4794182">And not finding this word anywhere, Petitioners simply rely on a series of decisions based on early opinions of the Attorney General and codified not in 28 U.S.C. Section 2516, to the effect that, because of sovereign immunity, interest is not awardable against the Government in the absence of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.492" offset="4883208">The Government then equates any adjustment in fees to compensate for delay in payment with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.503" offset="4911211">Therefore, according to the Government, no such adjustment may be made in calculating either a reasonable attorneys' fees, what constitutes a reasonable fee under the statute, or in calculating back pay which is intended to make a discriminated against employee full or whole for the injury they have suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.808" offset="5000445">We take the position and urge strongly that this case may not be decided by the simple and mechanical application of this alleged no interest rule, nor by a semantic dispute over what the word "interest" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.582" offset="5071603">Rather, we would urge, it requires an analysis of first the reasons for and historical basis of the VII and Congress' intent in making Title VII applicable to the Federal Government in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.744" offset="5184243">Now, it must be emphasized that our position comes from the language of the statute and Congressional intent, matters that the Government has dealt with hardly at all in its brief or today, but which are determinative, that is, Congressional intent when it passed the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.284" offset="5266372">And our position also flows from an Investigation of a series of decisions on the issue of interest and accounting for delays in payment in making awards, particularly a series of decisions by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.903" offset="5328857">These decisions have been cited and discussed and are in the Government's brief, and we call the Court's attention particularly to the Boston Sand and Gravel versus United States decision, the decision in Standard Oil versus United States, and the decision it Waite versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.599" offset="5399596">These decisions and Justice Holmes' discussion of the issue I think makes clear that there is not some absolute rule that the word "interest" must appear in the statute, that the underlying purpose and intent of the statute must be looked to and can govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.373" offset="5470754">Further, what is clear... and the Government doesn't dispute it seriously... is that Congress' central purpose in 1972 when it enacted the Equal Opportunity Act and those provisions that applied Title VII to the Federal Government was to override any and all sovereign immunity barriers to federal employees getting precisely the same relief as all other employees could get, all other employees, whether employees of private employers or state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.248" offset="5630205">And we've set out that legislative history in some detail in our brief, and it was discussed in some detail by this Court in Brown versus General Services Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.619" offset="5671688">Indeed, a succinct summary of the background of the statute can be found in the Government's brief in Brown, where there the Government pointed out that Congress was concerned with two aspects of sovereign immunity and the barriers it presented to federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.284" offset="5734381">One was a lack of any judicial remedy whatsoever, the ability to get into court in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.563" offset="5759459">But the second problem, in the words of the Government's brief, was that</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.171" offset="5777954">"some forms of relief were foreclosed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.639" offset="5791746">And this concern came out of extensive discussions in the hearings in the 1971 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.353" offset="5818600">It is discussed at great length in the legislative reports, both the Senate, the House, and the conference committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.851" offset="5848589">It's discussed on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.023" offset="5853291">Congress dealt with these two problems by, number one, providing the clear right to go into court for the first time; and by making the actions against the Federal Government once you got into court governed by precisely the same relief provisions and attorneys' fees provisions that governed actions against state, local government, and private employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.419" offset="5958930">They made it absolutely clear in the legislative history and the discussions therein that their purpose was to ensure that federal employees be treated with regard to employment discrimination claims precisely the same as everyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.670" offset="6407923">In 1983, in a unanimous decision by this Court written by Justice Marshall, General Motors Corporation versus Devex, which we cite and quote in our brief, the Court discussed pre-judgment interest and its function in fashioning an award that was fully compensatory in a patent infringement case, and cited Waite versus United States as standing for the proposition, which it does, that exactly that type of relief is available against the Federal Government when it infringes a patent, even though there is no express provision in that statute for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.562" offset="6559433">And the Court reached that conclusion by analyzing the purpose of that statute and what the function of what it calls pre-judgment interest was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.167" offset="6597885">And clearly, that purpose is substantially the same as the purpose the Congress had when it enacted the '72 Act making the provisions of Title VII applicable to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.019" offset="6661310">And that was, quite simply, to provide the federal courts and at the administrative level, because it also enlarged and clarified the powers of the Civil Service Commission, now the EEOC, and indeed the library of Congress by name, which was sort of a special status in the Act... at the administrative level, these agencies have the power to grant any relief necessary to fully recompense the employee for his or her loss, both financial and professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.741" offset="6788161">Indeed, at the same time Congress was making the statute apply to the Federal Government, it was expanding the remedial provisions of Title VII to make clear that federal courts have the power to make an employee who had suffered discrimination completely whole for the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.617" offset="8171710">It's just as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.085" offset="8177562">Now, whether if the no judgment interest rule then says, well, you can do that but you can't then impose a charge for loss of use of the money, we contend that theft is a somewhat different issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.814" offset="8856537">Let me just say, mention what the district court did, in response to Justice Stevens' inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.731" offset="8916200">What the district court said was, this is the total award for all the services, your client has paid you $3100, so you have to pay the client back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.962" offset="8957056">That was to ensure that the lawyer didn't get paid twice, once by the client and then once by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.350" offset="8978581">Now, the district court also did, in part of his overall calculation, first deduct 20 percent, sort of a reverse Blum factor, I suppose it would best be described, for quality of representation, and then brought it back up by 30 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.139" offset="9053813">The calculation got somewhat confused, as the Court of Appeals pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.634" offset="9259763">For example, the prime rate goes up and down with inflation because it factors in both aspects, both the loss of value and loss of use.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.827" offset="9356520">Again, I think by giving an example, a couple of examples really of the Government's position is right that no adjustment whatsoever, no matter what it's intended to compensate for, can be made for delay in payment, Congressional purpose would be totally thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.894" offset="9468847">That is, the Congressional purpose of ensuring that a federal employee when dealing with the specific area of employment discrimination would be entitled to the same relief, the same make-whole relief, the same attorney fee relief, as anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.764" offset="9524331">If one looks for example at this case, using this case for an example, under the Government's position an employee who worked for a state government, a local government, a private corporation would get at attorneys' fees award of some around $9,000, and that would take into account again just the loss in value because of inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.393" offset="9642822">A federal employee's award would only be $&lt;sixty-seven fifty&gt; [= 6750].</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.406" offset="9666855">If back pay were involved, again using the example of a state employee that worked for a state library that was denied a promotion in 1978 like Mr. Shaw was, and then was given an award in 1981, and the value of that back pay, or the back pay lost, in dollars was $5,000, that state employee would receive $7,000 in actual back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.379" offset="9778763">And the Government itself takes that position when it pursues state governments in federal court under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.908" offset="9804886">I call the attention of the Court, if I may, to a case that is not cited in our briefs, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission versus Erie, County of Erie, at 751 F. 2d 79, where the Government successfully argued and defeated the state's position that, since Title VII didn't say anything about interest, there could be no pre-judgment interest award in an award of back pay against it, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.239" offset="9934140">And indeed, one of the decisions of this Court, the old decisions of this Court, that the Government cites in its brief here, United States versus North Carolina, stands for the proposition that this no judgment... I'm sorry... no interest rule applies to all sovereigns, including the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.402" offset="10010835">Well, the Second Circuit adopted the EEOC's position that when you look to the purposes of the statute and the function of back pay, which is to put the person in the same position that they would have been in they had never been discriminated against, you could not do that unless you accounted for the loss in value of money because if inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.519" offset="10095263">If fact, pre-judgment interest period in both aspects was awarded in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.737" offset="10116161">Again, if we use that type of an example in this case and just talk about loss of value because of inflation, the state employee would receive, in the example I've given of having been denied $5,000 in back pay in 1978, would receive $7,000 in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.400" offset="10194842">Mr. Shaw or any other employee of the Library of Congress or any other federal agency would only receive the $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.380" offset="10234757">And ipso facto, that federal employee is not receiving the same relief as any other employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.534" offset="10267358">Just, you cannot say that $5,000 is the same as $7,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.345" offset="10282613">And again, Congress' clear intent... and it comes but of every aspect of the legislative history, the structure of the statute itself... was to ensure that federal employees not be in a disfavored position in Title VII actions that they bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.368" offset="10354711">If the Court has no further questions, thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.881" offset="10376759">Just a few quick points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.115" offset="10385640">First, in response to something that was raised by Justices O'Connor and Rehnquist on the difference between compensation for delay and compensation for use of the money, neither this Court's decision nor the decisions of any lower court have ever distinguished between those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.797" offset="10444468">This no interest rule has always applied to every aspect of compensation for delay.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2581.998" offset="10465261">Does that mean... may I just interrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.731" offset="10476128">Does that mean that, say there's a five year piece of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.574" offset="10487518">At the end of the litigation the judge thinks that it would be fairer to, say, award fees on the basis of current going rates in the market for legal services, rather than those that applied five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.427" offset="10538927">That would be prohibited by the no interest rule, would you say?</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.473" offset="10551152">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.817" offset="10556481">To the extent that that use of current rates would be designed to compensate for a change in the value of money in the meantime, that would obviously be compensating for delay, and the purpose of the no interest rule as articulated by this Court is to prevent that type of compensation being paid by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.029" offset="10625340">Do any of the no interest rule cases on which you rely actually discuss the problem of inflation, as opposed to the problem of loss of use of the money?</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.714" offset="10660135">A number of the Court of Appeals decision which address interest on back pay awards under Title VII do discuss that, and Saunders versus Claytor, a Ninth Circuit decision, and one from the District of Columbia Circuit, Blake versus Califano, and both conclude that, relying on this Court's no interest decisions, that there should be no difference between the two, that both are prevented by the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.048" offset="10741428">This Court's decisions to my knowledge have not explicitly drawn any distinction, but I think that conclusively establishes our point, because they have not inquired as to whether or not there is some element which is compensable, The Court has simple said no compensation for delay, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.402" offset="10798793">I think this relates to the suggestion that compensation for delay or some type of pre-judgment interest is an element of a reasonable attorneys' fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.226" offset="10834110">I'm not sure that the change in the value of the money is necessarily covered by the notion compensation for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.175" offset="10865980">It's compensation for change in value instead of loss of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.158" offset="10877892">Maybe it is, I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.189" offset="10881967">Well, as the rule has been treated by the Court, again, it hasn't inquired as to whether or not there should be some difference in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.592" offset="10923554">And certainly the value of the fee award will have been adjusted simply because of delay, and always articulated by the Court, it is that the United States cannot be held liable for a delay at all, and that gives rise to the application of the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.209" offset="10994084">And that clearly, whether you're compensating for a change in the value of the money or whatever other element of the award is premised on passage of time, that compensates for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.502" offset="11039224">I think as illustration of this is this Court's decisions interpreting the term "just compensation" as used in statutes and contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.092" offset="11073601">I think it's generally recognized that the term "just compensation" includes some type of component for in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.059" offset="11097425">The Court has held repeatedly that, where constitutional taking are involved, payment of interest is constitutionally compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.821" offset="11124488">The Court has still held, in statutes or contracts that require payment of just compensation, unless interest is explicitly referred to, interest is not subsumed within the term "just compensation".</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.270" offset="11162313">And I think here the same thing is true: interest is not subsumed within the term reasonable attorneys' fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.861" offset="11184674">"In each case it's a compensation for delay which is barred by the rule. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.290" offset="11282372">To our knowledge, it has been quite precise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.575" offset="11395534">It simply required a payment of full and complete compensation for the infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.121" offset="11413715">But the United States did not contest liability for interest in Waite, and the Court really didn't discuss the no interest rule at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.806" offset="11432419">One final point, as to the purposes of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.209" offset="11466065">We acknowledge that Title VII was designed to erase sovereign immunity as a barrier to employees entering federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.940" offset="11488948">But again, the Court has emphasized that, whether or not interest can be added to other relief that is authorized is a separate ancillary question that must be resolved by the application of the no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.749" offset="11532207">I think this is not a case where the purposes of Title VII will be entirely thwarted, although even if it were that would be something that should be addressed to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.433" offset="11562927">Interest has never been awarded outside of the District of Columbia Circuit on Title VII attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.712" offset="11588109">Even in the District of Columbia Circuit, it has not been awarded, certainly not before 1980... even in 1982, in a case called Parker versus Lewis, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that interest was not available on Title VII attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.473" offset="11631159">And yet, plaintiffs in Title VII actions against the Government have been able to obtain representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.643" offset="11651848">This is not a case where the statute simply cannot function without the award of interest.</text>
