          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_l_sherrod" startTime="67.977" stopTime="379.393">
            <label>Mr. Randall L. Sherrod</label>
            <text syncTime="67.977" offset="394896">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="407331">At the outset I would like to go over a couple of facts that I think is necessary in the analysis of this important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.333" offset="436274">First of all, Texas has a bifurcated trial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.952" offset="450798">Prior to a trial a defendant has a right to elect whether a judge or a jury will assess punishment in a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.241" offset="483922">The respondent at his first trial in this case was tried by a jury and found guilty of murder, having previously filed an election to have a jury assess punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.532" offset="525091">The jury assessed punishment at 20 years' confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.317" offset="540242">Respondent filed a motion for a new trial with the same trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.619" offset="557483">The motion was granted by that judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.971" offset="566887">A second jury again found the respondent guilty of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.689" offset="589770">Prior to the trial a motion had been filed, this time alleging that the judge should be the one that would assess punishment, and of course we think that is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.766" offset="638044">The same judge at the second trial assessed 50 years' confinement, and at the request of the defendant in this particular case the trial judge also entered specific findings of fact on why the 50 years' sentence was given by the court at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.608" offset="705440">Of course, I think from looking at the specific facts that we are discussing in this case, there's two rather general questions that need to be answered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.666" offset="745669">The first question is, does the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require the presumption of vindictiveness enacted in North Carolina versus Pearce upon retrial of a criminal case, or do any of the following three areas that I would like to discuss render the reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness, as the Court has said, de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.412" offset="832604">First of all, I think that the most important and the strongest allegation that the state has is the very fact that the defendant in this particular kind of case, pursuant to Texas law, has the absolute right to determine which sentencing authority will have the power to assess the punishment at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.362" offset="924451">I think that's extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.647" offset="933541">When you're discussing that particular element of the question, I think it's important to recall Pearce and understand and Pearce basically stands for the proposition that punishment assessed upon retrial of a criminal case should not be set in a certain amount because of vindictiveness of the sentencing authority toward a defendant for exercising his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.345" offset="1028314">Vindictiveness, as the Court has said, should have no place in setting punishment upon retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.416" offset="1052660">A presumption of vindictiveness in Pearce was established because of the possible chilling effect a retaliatory motive could have upon a defendant's exercise of his legal right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.591" offset="1109293">The presumption of vindictiveness is not required solely because of the possibility of a greater sentence that may possibly be assessed upon retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.281" offset="1148059">Neither does the possibility of vindictiveness alone require a presumption of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.285" offset="1172092">The presumption of vindictiveness has been held to apply only where there is a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness, and I think when the Court looks at Colton, Caffin, Bordenkercher and Goodwin, that that's the interpretation that would now stand concerning the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.814" offset="1250250">The presumption of vindictiveness was enacted by this court to protect against the chilling effect of retaliatory motivation in assessing punishment when a defendant has basically exercised his right to appeal, not the fact that vindictiveness may occur, but for the retaliatory vindictiveness that may occur by a trial judge at a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.547" offset="1349202">When we look at the most common application of Pearce, I think the validity is still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.368" offset="1376474">You take a situation where a defendant is tried the first time and a trial judge assesses punishment, and you take the fact that he exercises his right of appeal and that he receives a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.759" offset="1426002">When you consider the fact that if the judge assesses punishment greater than what he assessed at the first trial, there's only two reasonable reasons that the Court should consider motivated that increase, in sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.352" offset="1480336">Of course, the first one is obviously that he was retaliating against the defendant for exercising his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.106" offset="1511370">The second option may be that the second trial has brought to light additional evidence that may in fact justify an increase in the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.699" offset="1561734">Now, the rationale in Pearce and those particular cases is still very valid, and there's a reason for it and it still applies, and that reason is that if in fact there was no retaliatory motive, it's not too difficult for the Court to place a list of those reasons upon the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.893" offset="1634563">So, under those facts--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="379.393" stopTime="386.083">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="379.393" offset="1640519">But on these facts, don't we have to cut back on Pearce somewhat if this judgment is to be reversed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_l_sherrod" startTime="386.083" stopTime="437.516">
            <label>Mr. Randall L. Sherrod</label>
            <text syncTime="386.083" offset="1667269">--I think you do, sir, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.368" offset="1680434">Specifically in a case like this when the defendant has the option of filing at the second point, the only reason for filing to the judge in the second point, rather than the fact that he may be trying to exercise or protect one of his constitutional rights, I submit to you is more that he is trying to seek a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.949" offset="1762772">He is trying to limit the second court from considering evidence or exercising its discretion for the first time in what may in fact be a fair sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.320" offset="1800284">Now, when you analyze this very closely, what you see is that the application of Pearce in states like Texas actually results in a chilling effect upon a defendant to go to a jury to have that jury determine punishment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="437.516" stopTime="442.770">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="437.516" offset="1873009">Did not Pearce leave open the possibility of an increased sentence based on new information?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_l_sherrod" startTime="442.770" stopTime="475.724">
            <label>Mr. Randall L. Sherrod</label>
            <text syncTime="442.770" offset="1894012">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.303" offset="1896206">I believe under Wasman that it basically has, and also under interpretations given strictly under Pearce because there is two provisions in there that rather conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.309" offset="1932150">I believe Wasman indicates that that has in fact occurred, and that's the second issue that the Court can consider in this particular case, and of course that would be whether there was sufficient evidence presented on the record that would justify an increase in sentence based upon Wasman and its interpretation of the Pearce doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.539" offset="2017101">The second area that I think very important--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="475.724" stopTime="481.395">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="475.724" offset="2025878">Of course, in Pearce, Justice Stewart spoke of events happening after.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.645" offset="2053567">These events, I suppose you concede, all took place before?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_l_sherrod" startTime="488.115" stopTime="574.155">
            <label>Mr. Randall L. Sherrod</label>
            <text syncTime="488.115" offset="2075406">Every one of the facts that would justify an increase in sentence did in fact occur prior to the first trial, but I think what's important in this case, and the information that contains in Wasman, and where we need further definition and a little guidance, is whether or not the increase in the word from "conduct" to "events" that was established in Wasman indicates that it's events that come to light at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.634" offset="2189509">I think when you look at the rationale in the protections that Pearce is meant to apply to, you see that there is no reason that the Court or the sentencing authority at the second trial should be automatically limited from assessing what they feel is a fair punishment, and when you look at the application of Pearce, and the application that the State of Texas... that has resulted in their literal application of Pearce, you see situations like this where the court of appeals judge says that it's rather unfair that there is no evidence of vindictiveness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.259" offset="2348020">And yet, because we must follow the application of North Carolina versus Pearce and the literal interpretation of that, that when a judge assesses the punishment at the second trial that under those facts there is a limit upon the sentence, that it can result in unjust sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.510" offset="2453032">Of course, the first one is the fact that the defendant has the option of electing who sets punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.594" offset="2561388">Because our position would be, Your Honor, that there is no reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness in this particular situation, again, when the defendant has the option of electing which sentencing authority shall assess the punishment, and also the very fact that in this case a jury assessed punishment for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.309" offset="2748216">That was done at the request of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.903" offset="3018531">When you read the actual opinion that came down in Pearce and when you analyze the interest... and really, I think what you've got is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.642" offset="3053535">When you look at the cases that have come down, in the four cases I previously discussed, I think what you find is that the Court now is really saying, the mere possibility of an increase in sentence or the mere possibility of vindictiveness is not in and of itself sufficient reason for the Pearce application.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.753" offset="3125946">In other words, is there a reasonable likelihood that vindictiveness will occur, and that is what the Pearce doctrine should still stand for today, and I think the extension in the application by the Texas courts has limited a very important element that we have, and by a strict adoption of the North Carolina versus Pearce presumption of vindictiveness, what they do is disallow this very, very important fairness doctrine to both the state with a legitimate concern in exercising discretion in punishment, and also from the defendant, to have his particular case modified to the individual facts of that case and also to the particular defendant, his background and everything that's brought out in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.019" offset="3323014">So, I believe it has a great effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.555" offset="3333150">Again, when you look at the analysis on it, if there's any chilling effect like the Court talked about in United States versus Jackson, the chilling affect comes from the application of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.546" offset="3385185">Any defendant in the State of Texas will be chilled to exercise this option, to have a jury assess his punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.301" offset="3416114">The reason is because he cannot risk the possibility of going to a jury and receiving a greater amount of punishment under the doctrine established in Chaffen, and if there's any chill to a defendant's rights it's the chill that arises from the application of North Carolina versus Pearce and the presumption of vindictiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.550" offset="3513185">It seems to me that you have argued... it seems to me that defendant would always be exposed to the risk of increased punishment because the jury would be a different sentencing authority from the first jury, and under your view the judge is a different sentencing authority from the first jury, so neither of them would be limited by the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.594" offset="3573372">So, if your argument is correct, really, it's open season on the new sentence?</text>

            <text syncTime="867.580" offset="3593329">It is, Your Honor, and the reason my argument should stand is because, first of all, to modify or to adopt North Carolina versus Pearce has a chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.686" offset="3629692">You cause a defendant to elect to go to a judge that he feels may be vindictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.840" offset="3650276">You cause him, because of Chaffin, to file to go to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.892" offset="3670547">It's a Catch-22.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.661" offset="3677652">That's what it amounts to, because if there is any... if there is any chilling effect... you do away with the chilling effect, the State of Texas does, by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.552" offset="3721120">It says, if you are in fear that this judge will be vindictive in assessing the second punishment, then you have the power to elect to go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.888" offset="3754557">But he's not going to go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.057" offset="3763230">He can't run that risk under Chaffin versus Stynchcombe.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.642" offset="3777545">And, what I'm saying is that if you free that up for both the trial court and also for the jury to assess whatever they feel is a reasonable punishment, at the first instance when they have an opportunity to exercise their discretion, that that is more fair than the situation we have through the actual application of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.927" offset="3878691">The other point that we have in this case is the fact that the judge in this case actually was the court that granted the retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.865" offset="3918397">Now, I don't feel that that's as important as the first two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.519" offset="3936996">I feel that the first two areas are the ones that have more constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.840" offset="3958312">One thing that I think is extremely important, depending on which one of these theories the Court may decide, may have a much greater effect on the nation as a whole, limited strictly to the fact that the option and the election lying with the defendant should control and should say that because of that fact, North Carolina versus Pearce, the arguments will be restricted purely to the State of Texas and states that allow the defendant that particular right.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.061" offset="4091223">But, if the Court goes under the second theory that we have proposed, and that is that there should be no restriction when a sentencing authority exercises its discretion at the punishment stage for the very first time, it will affect also the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.521" offset="4153081">I think the argument is valid in each of those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.356" offset="4164366">I don't believe the Court has ever written upon the effect that retrial would have, and the granting of retrial, by the trial judge that in fact sets punishment the second time, and I don't believe the Court has ever ruled on this particular authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.783" offset="4226119">Even though in North Carolina versus Pearce the same judge was involved, that issue was never raised before this Court, and I think it's extremely important to balance the legitimate interest that the state and the defendant have in wide discretion in the sentencing authority, and that must be balanced with the reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness that may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.065" offset="4319220">In summation, under any of these arguments, I don't believe it is necessary for the presumption of vindictiveness to be applied like the courts in Texas have done, and again, those courts are talking about following North Carolina versus Pearce literally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.302" offset="4892137">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.687" offset="4901750">I'd first like to address some of the issues raised by the question as to whether the presumption established by Pearce should apply to the peculiar facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.659" offset="4941561">The petitioner in this case has raised first and foremost the issue concerning the election that defendants can make in our state as to whether jury or judge may assess punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.183" offset="4995687">First, I would like to note that we argue, and quite forcefully, that this Court absolutely cannot consider this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.491" offset="5036960">Our state court, the court of criminal appeals, has already made a binding decision as to a matter of state law by way of construing the statute created by our Legislature, Article 3707, and in that construction has told the court that our Legislature has made a determination that defendant should be able to make the choice to elect between judge or jury for sentencing, free of any vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.225" offset="5139883">In our interpretation, that is a conclusive determination, a construction of a state statute, and because of that, this Court will be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.831" offset="5178335">If the merits of the argument can be considered anyway, several things need to be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.603" offset="5209368">I think that to really understand our position on this question of jury election it is important to look at the decisions a trial lawyer in Texas who is defending a criminal defendant has to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.328" offset="5260255">Because of the operation of the rules of evidence, trial lawyers have to make certain decisions as to which sentencing body they deride to elect on behalf of their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.350" offset="5296408">If a defendant elects to be punished by a jury, it means that he is going to be bound by certain rules of evidence, as to what he can put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.456" offset="5336741">For example, a jury can only consider certain things in the State of Texas because only certain items of evidence are admissible before, the prior criminal record of the defendant--</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.891" offset="5454501">Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.177" offset="5463696">If a defendant elects to go before the jury in a sentencing hearing, he can put on evidence, or the state can present evidence of his prior criminal record, his reputation in the community, and the jury can consider the facts of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.151" offset="5511553">Under our rules of evidence, that's all the jury can consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.937" offset="5526704">If he elects to go in front of the judge and have the judge assess punishment, he can put on a great deal more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.924" offset="5550632">For example, we have a system whereby defendants can have a pre-sentence investigation conducted, very similar to the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.744" offset="5581979">That can be considered by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.780" offset="5590129">Opinion testimony about the nature and character of the defendant can be considered by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.683" offset="5613744">None of these things can be brought forward under the rules of evidence if a defendant elects to go in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.437" offset="5640702">So, you see, the choice as to be made based on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.407" offset="5660555">It's a difficult decision for every defendant in Texas to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.526" offset="5677065">The problem with the argument advanced by the petitioner is that they would create a new consideration for defendants, and that consideration would be whether the judge would possibly be motivated by feelings of retaliation and vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.488" offset="5744878">If this argument is accepted, vindictiveness is going to become a factor in making the decision as to whether judge or jury should be selected to assess punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.360" offset="5784376">Now, the import of North Carolina versus Pearce, according to our reading of that decision, is that vindictiveness should play absolutely no role whatsoever in the criminal trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.401" offset="5832545">Pearce sought to abolish vindictiveness completely and absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.988" offset="5850936">This argument begins to resurrect the spectre of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.857" offset="5866400">It begins to make vindictiveness play a certain role in the whole process of criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.411" offset="5888656">Because of that, it should be rejected as a procedural distinction that somehow removes a Texas case from the ambit of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.794" offset="6506087">The second question that the State has raised is the idea that because the judge granted a new trial on motion of the defendant, and that because of the procedural situation of the case involving as it did a motion for new trial rather than a direct appeal to a higher tribunal, the argument goes that this so far removes this case from the ambit of Pearce that the presumption of vindictiveness should not be engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.544" offset="6617159">There is no functional difference between a defendant who is alleging error on the part of the trial judge and seeking a new trial through the device of a motion for new trial in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.669" offset="6661672">There is no functional difference between the defendant in that circumstance and a defendant who is filing a direct appeal alleging error on the part of a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.025" offset="6699079">We would urge that this Court adopt the reasoning set forth by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Monaco in which that Court held that because a defendant had the right to exercise the right to move for a new trial without fear of vindictiveness, the mere fact of filing a motion for new trial or gaining retrial upon a motion for a new trial is a distinction without difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.056" offset="6795210">We would urge the Court to adopt the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.627" offset="6813496">The other distinguishing factor that the State has posited in their briefs is that because a jury imposed the first sentence here and the judge imposed the second, the judge had no personal stake in the outcome of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.335" offset="6868353">Consequently the realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, if any, would be de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.005" offset="6891027">We would just point out in response to that argument that the judge has certainly the same personal and institutional stake in the sanctity of his decision and in the outcome of the case that he would in any other circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.979" offset="6942854">We don't believe that to be a sufficient distinguishing factor to bring this case outside the ambit of Pearce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.991" offset="8282936">You will also notice that that petition was denied and discretionary review on the court's own motion, on a very limited area, was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.299" offset="8320134">It would be our position that the denial of the original petition for discretionary review that had been filed by the court and did in fact include those issues... and the other thing that it is important to remember is, Wasman did not come down until after we had filed our state's original petition for discretionary review.</text>
