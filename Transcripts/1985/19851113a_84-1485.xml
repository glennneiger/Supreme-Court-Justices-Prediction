            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150877">Mrs. Messore, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="constance_l_messore" startTime="9.022" stopTime="346.069">
            <label>Ms. Constance L. Messore</label>
            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="186926">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="198420">This case is here on Petitioner's petition for certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.328" offset="232170">The Petitioner in this case contends that the First Circuit erred when it reversed the judgment of the federal district court and issued the Respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="281385">In doing so, the First Circuit held that the Respondent's three written waivers of his Miranda rights and his three signed confessions should be suppressed because, although, he had beer given the complete Miranda warnings prior to each confession and he had agreed to waive his rights, his waivers were not knowingly made whom he had not requested, had because an attorney, called the police station where he happened to be in custody, had been given misleading information by whomever answered the telephone and was told that there would be no further interrogation of the Respondent that night, and the Respondent was not informed of this telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.766" offset="465914">I feel in this particular case that it's important to briefly summarize the facts, and then I would like to explain why the First Circuit has misconceived the role of the attorney under the Miranda case in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.260" offset="523906">The Respondent, Brian Burbine, was arrested with two other men on a breaking and entering charge by the Cranston police.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="566119">He was taken to the police station and he was... the other two men were interrogated by the Cranston police.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.804" offset="598093">As a result of this interrogation, there was suspect cast on Brian Burbine that he might be a suspect in a murder that had taken place in a neighboring town... city of Providence three months prior to his present arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.730" offset="661728">At this time the Cranston police called the Providence police, who came to the Cranston police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.383" offset="688373">They gave Burbine his Miranda rights, and first he said that he had had nothing to do with Mary Jo's murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.173" offset="723481">And so they put him back into the smaller room where he had been kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.941" offset="738632">But about ten minutes later, they heard a banging and a kicking on his door, and he was brought out into the main room and he told them that he was sorry for what he'd done, he was disgusted, and that he wanted to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.368" offset="792340">At this time the Providence police again gave him his Miranda warnings orally, he read them, he signed a waiver, and then eventually signed a written confession implicating him in the murder of Mary Jo Hickey.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.377" offset="852317">He was placed back in the room and shortly thereafter he stain initiated a conversation with the police, saying that he had left something out, there was more that he wished to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.833" offset="890142">He was brought out, again given his Miranda rights orally, signed a written waiver, and gave an additional confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.106" offset="923266">It just so happened that this same evening somehow his sister had discovered that he had been arrested on this breaking and entering, and she called the public defender's office about 8:00 o'clock in the evening to get an attorney for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.099" offset="983243">It appears that Brian Burbine himself had an appointment with a public defender named Casparian that afternoon at 4: O0 o'clock, but he'd been unable to keep the appointment because of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.739" offset="1025770">The person who answered the phone at the public defender's office said that Casparian was not available, but she got another attorney, attorney Munson, who at 8:15 called the police station and asked if Brian and Sparks, the other man with him, were being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.166" offset="1091494">She said she asked for the detective division and somebody, a male voice, answered "detectives", said that, yes, he was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.372" offset="1124304">She said, although Casparian was the attorney who represented Burbine, he was not available, but if he was to be placed in a lineup or further interrogated that evening she would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.929" offset="1174564">The answer that she got, she testified, was that he was not going to be further interrogated that evening; in fact,</text>
            <text syncTime="264.352" offset="1208209">"we're through with him for the night. "</text>
            <text syncTime="266.470" offset="1216673">At this point she did not pursue the conversation, she did not leave any instructions as to Burbine, nor did she ask that any message be given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.659" offset="1253453">And in fact, Burbine was never told about this telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.361" offset="1272261">The next morning, Burbine was taken to the Cranston police district court, he was arraigned and he was handed over to the Providence police, who took him to their station, gave him again his Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.851" offset="1322208">He again signed a waiver, gave a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.303" offset="1336000">And at this point the Providence police said: We're going to get an attorney for you because you're about to be placed in a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.307" offset="1364004">He still said he did not want an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.992" offset="1378841">But at this time, when he was told that he must have one, he mentioned Casparian's name and the public defender's office was contacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.030" offset="1410919">All of the police who testified at the suppression hearing in this case, the Cranston detectives and the Providence detectives, claimed that they had not received a telephone call from the attorney, nor did they know anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.790" offset="1474031">At the suppression hearing, it was the xx position that this call had never been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.511" offset="1496915">But the trial judge did find that the call was made and that someone, whomever it was, had received this call.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.950" offset="1526590">In addition, the trial court--</text>

            <text syncTime="349.271" offset="1547906">The trial justice also found that he could find no conspiracy or collusion on the part of the Cranston police in attempting to keep Burbine from an attorney, that he had knowingly waived his rights, and that he had not asked for an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.548" offset="1953013">The federal district court, giving substantial deference to the state court's finding of historical fact, agreed with the Rhode Island Supreme Court and they did not grant his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.789" offset="2005989">But the First Circuit court reversed and they gave what they described as a limited ruling when they said deliberate or reckless misleading of an attorney who has a legitimate professionally ethical interest in a suspect in custody, who expresses to the police a desire to be present at any interrogation of the suspect, combined with a police failure to communicate that exchange to the suspect, is more than just one factor in the calculus of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.744" offset="2133780">This combination of circumstances, the First Circuit said, clearly vitiates any claim that a waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.695" offset="2453623">The ruling of the First Circuit goes beyond the purpose of Miranda, because Miranda when it extended into the police station these procedural safeguards to prevent the police from violating a suspect's right to be free from coerced self-discrimination guaranteed to him under the Fifth Amendment, these procedural guidelines and Miranda rights were to protect his rights when he was in custody and when he was being subjected to interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.797" offset="2577966">But they were also to provide the police with guidelines, or these bright-line rules, as they're called, which could be readily understood and easily applied by the police, and thereby relieve them and the lower courts from making exceedingly difficult case by case judgments as to whether a particular confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.263" offset="2671902">The police are required to give the well-known Miranda warnings and any time that they did not give these warnings obviously his confession would have been inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.470" offset="2720699">But these Miranda warnings are not themselves rights protected by the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.461" offset="4736621">--Yes, and none of those things are enough to trigger the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.698" offset="4757623">It no more addresses that issue than the Seventh Amendment does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.250" offset="4771834">It simply... and I believe that the way Couveja dealt with Escobedo would establish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.804" offset="4798061">In Escobedo there was I think an existing attorney-client relationship, but my recollection is that Gouveia said that the criminal prosecution hadn't begun for the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.409" offset="4836513">That was a false start.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.195" offset="4843618">Let me say that when the relevant and well-established constitutional principles and policies are considered, the conclusion that the First Circuit erred in this case is logically inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.003" offset="4894818">First of all, the Court has said too many times to leave the issue in any doubt that there's no constitutional policy against obtaining and using voluntary confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.025" offset="4930972">Similarly, it has repeatedly said that the purpose of Miranda is to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination; that the requirement of warnings and waivers represents a means of ensuring that the elements of compulsion in the stationhouse interrogation have been satisfactorily counteracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.455" offset="5008608">Thirdly, the Court has made it perfectly clear that you do not need a lawyer to waive your rights to a lawyer or to waive your other Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.378" offset="5044343">In fact, the notion that Miranda creates a right to counsel is I think a fundamental misunderstanding of the parties on the other side of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.452" offset="5096588">There is no direct constitutionally created right of an arrested suspect to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.558" offset="5129084">Rather, the Miranda warnings tell him he has a right to counsel because it is believed important that he understand that he can have that kind of help so that we can have assurance that when he chooses to speak--</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.407" offset="5216438">I think the purpose is to ensure the voluntariness of his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.442" offset="5228559">The purpose is to dispel what was found to be inherent coerciveness of custodial interrogation, and in that case it is a sort of white lie that seems to me quite harmless and in fact useful, considering the purposed of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.236" offset="5299821">And the fact is that the police do not have to provide a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.622" offset="5321346">They need simply terminate the interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.509" offset="5344856">So I think it's quite clear that there is no Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.243" offset="5755814">Therefore, in terms of the voluntariness or the degree to which he may have been coerced, there simply is no possible effect of the failure to tell him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.450" offset="13344595">If you accept that there was an attorney-client relationship in this case, I think as I understand Gouveia what it stands for is that there is not a right to appointed counsel before the commencement of formal judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.192" offset="13399556">But in fact one of the points made in Gouveia was that the prisoners had access to counsel, that they had the ability to communicate with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.048" offset="13434978">And I would read implicit in that the fact that you could create an attorney-client relationship before the commencement of formal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.552" offset="13457026">Whether or not you have a right to appointed counsel is a separate question and that's not the issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.543" offset="13716996">Now, clearly Burbine continued to have the right to waive even his Sixth Amendment right to counsel without his lawyer being present.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.251" offset="13883866">With respect to the Fifth Amendment, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.153" offset="13891390">With respect to violation of Miranda... of one of the rights generated by Miranda, I think Mr. Justice Blackmun has raised the question of whether or not the same standard would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.559" offset="13925035">I would argue that certainly for a Sixth Amendment waiver you would need the Johnson versus Zerbst type of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.046" offset="13955024">Now, in this case we've argued all the way through that it didn't exist, but if you had a waiver that was a Fifth Amendment at least in this case I don't see the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.652" offset="13993476">If you had a waiver that was only with respect to Miranda rights as opposed to the Fifth Amendment question, then I could see a difference and a higher standard question imposed with respect to the waiver of Sixth Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.408" offset="14132448">Nowhere has the state, nowhere has the United States Government, ever suggested that there is any limit to the deception that could be visited either on the client or on the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.328" offset="14164108">There was deception of the lawyer in this case, but there was at least also implicit deception to the client by not telling the client what was going on, by not telling the client about the attorney's call.</text>
