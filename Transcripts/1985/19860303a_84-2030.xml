            <text syncTime="80.693" offset="465984">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal from a judgment by the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.180" offset="503914">That court held that the lowest price liquor affirmation requirement of New York's alcoholic beverage control law does not violate the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.880" offset="554696">On this appeal, Brown-Forman argued that the statute is unconstitutional upon its face because its necessary effect is the extraterritorial regulation by New York of liquor prices in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.979" offset="619062">New York effectively sets the minimum price for liquor sales in every state in the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.446" offset="780916">That is conceded, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.207" offset="788022">The supplier initially determines his own price for each brand which he offers for sale to New York suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.021" offset="819264">It is at that point that the New York statute reaches in and obligates him, mandates that he not for an extended period of time, the posting period, charge any lower price in any other state, having filed that price in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.004" offset="895228">The statute works this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.225" offset="904110">On the 25th of every month, every supplier must file or post a schedule of prices to be charged for all of us products sold to New York wholesalers during the next following month.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.185" offset="963878">Last Tuesday, all suppliers had to file an affirmation and a schedule of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.931" offset="990836">It would cover all of their sales for the month of April of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.052" offset="1007346">All sales to New York wholesalers must be at those explicit posted prices, neither higher nor lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.238" offset="1044126">The statute also prohibits the price discrimination or difference in prices charged to one New York wholesaler as compared with other New York wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.484" offset="1089057">Finally, as a condition of the right to sell to New York wholesalers, the New York statute, as Justice White indicated, obligates every supplier to adhere to that price once posted in New York during the entire calendar month that is covered by the posting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.330" offset="1176515">Every month every supplier must go through this affirmation process again.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.124" offset="1199711">The language of the statute and the affirmation or verification form employed by the state liquor authority are essentially in the same identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.131" offset="1247672">If the Court will indulge me for a moment, I would like to read the explicit salient provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.326" offset="1272436">It required that the New York posted price must be no higher than the lowest price at which each item of liquor will be sold anywhere in any other state at any time during the calendar month for which such schedule shall be in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.780" offset="2578245">I think there are pragmatic reasons why New York will not go back to a retrospective statute, but let me try to satisfy and answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.126" offset="2615653">The original New York statute in essence said to suppliers, you cannot charge prices to New York wholesalers this month which are any higher than the lowest price that you charged anywhere else two months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.998" offset="2691199">Now, what are the implications of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="639.592" offset="2701543">First, unlike the present prospective statute that requires a commitment, a promise, an obligation on the part of the supplier as to tying his hands every place else for a successive month, the original statute merely reflected prices that had in fact already been charged elsewhere in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.656" offset="2793808">There was therefore no reaching out and prospectively putting suppliers into a straightjacket so far as their freedom to charge whatever prices, to lower whatever prices midmonth they might choose to or be compelled by the exigencies of competition to do in any other state.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.460" offset="2880952">But, Mr. Flinn, even in the retrospective situation, it seems that the statute would actually affect prices out of state eventually.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.132" offset="5515662">The result by the very definition of the affirmation concept is that the minimum price in all of those states is also the maximum price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.360" offset="5556622">There is a single price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.411" offset="5564773">Affirmation has been on the books in New York dating back to 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.712" offset="5641991">That alone, apart from posting requirements, has injected a rigidity, a nonflexibility, indeed, an absolute uniformity of price into all of those 21 affirmation states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.784" offset="5706252">But it has, if you will, slopped over and produced essentially the same prices in many other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.249" offset="5732165">It is that fact of this industry, Justice Stevens, that I think explains why my answer to your question has to be probably there has been very little midmonth price reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.259" offset="5784201">Now, let me speak candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.851" offset="5798516">I am not sure that Brown-Forman's position is representative of the views or attitudes of all the suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.784" offset="5826311">Candidly, affirmation has created a nice live and let live kind of competitive ease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.389" offset="5860688">There are undoubtedly some suppliers who relish the fact that they no longer have to make price decisions responsive to the unique competitive forces of each local marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.077" offset="5907499">There are undoubtedly suppliers who are happy that state managers no longer have to be given that kind of pricing freedom to respond to the competitive exigencies of their particular marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.185" offset="5955878">There are, on the other hand, suppliers, and Brown-Forman is one of those, who believe that a competitive environment in which parties could and had to respond to competitive initiatives would produce a more rational, sound pricing situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.908" offset="6150751">It is ironic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.789" offset="6154304">The Moreland Act Commission never said that the alleged overcharging or higher retail prices to consumers in New York which it found was attributable to any discrimination in the supplier's prices to New York wholesalers as compared with their prices to wholesalers elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.020" offset="6227238">The Moreland Act Commission laid the blame on New York for having adopted a mandatory state-enforced fair trade resale price maintenance structure, which in essence controlled the prices from the retailer to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.230" offset="6288051">Be that as it may, when the state legislature adopted affirmation, it did so on the ground that it was going to, and it was very politically popular, I can assure you, Justice Rehnquist, it was going to assure all New York voters and consumers that their wholesalers would not be paying higher prices than wholesalers anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.953" offset="6371016">Now, what can New York do today?</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.374" offset="6380629">If the Court agrees with us that this prospective type of statute which is now the typical affirmation statute in all of those states having affirmation, is unconstitutional on its face because it extraterritorially regulates prices elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.896" offset="6446771">I believe that essentially the only course available to New York if it wishes to have a statute that will withstand constitutional muster on its face is to go the concurrent or current price affirmation time reference, and even then New York, I believe, has to be exceedingly careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.350" offset="6528586">New York, because of this non-discrimination in price among different New York wholesalers policy is going to have to face up to the fact that the posting requirement is fundamentally inconsistent with even a contemporaneous, truly current price affirmation standard, because the posting ties suppliers' hands, not only for the 30-day or calendar period, whatever the period may be, so far as their sales pricing to New York wholesalers, but by the very definition of affirmation does so in their sales to every other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.492" offset="6677171">Now, whether New York is well advised in following that policy, I think, is open to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.728" offset="6706115">It is obviously not a question for me, not a question, with all due respect, for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.681" offset="6725863">But ironically, New York, in view of its size and importance, the volume purchases and efficiencies of its wholesalers, probably has its consumers more penalized by the affirmation concept than most any other state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.197" offset="6975907">It has to be an affirmation requirement which not only recognizes that New York has no right to interfere with future pricing decisions by suppliers in other states, but makes it clear that it does not interfere with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.633" offset="7037661">It in essence says, look, you are free to lower your prices in any other state at any time as long as you simultaneously reduce your prices here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.270" offset="7084263">Now, I believe that kind of statute would pass facial muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.497" offset="7109132">There is substance, Justice White, to your question, and I did not complete my answer to Justice Blackmun as to whether Seagram v. Hostetter might have been decided differently if this Court had been aware, and it was not brought to the Court's attention by the parties who briefed that case that there would be more than a single retrospective statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.231" offset="7196067">There would be, therefore, this necessity to stop selling in one or more states in order to comply with the current or contemporaneous or prospective price affirmation requirements of other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.094" offset="7403584">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court today is whether New York may insist that liquor prices to New York wholesalers be as low as prices charged elsewhere in the country as part of its comprehensive regulatory scheme for liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.899" offset="7490728">New York attempted to secure this goal by means of a nondiscriminatory regulation solely directed to the intrastate sale of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.275" offset="7528240">Writing for a unanimous court in the 1966 Seagram decision, Justice Stewart reasoned that the New York affirmation law had a legitimate purpose, that it was solely directed to intrastate activities, and that under the affirmation law New York was exercising the core power granted to a state under the Twenty-First Amendment, which is to regulate the importation and distribution of liquor destined for sale within the state's borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.185" offset="7651852">The New York affirmation law conforms precisely to the holding in Seagram that consistent with both the Twenty-First Amendment, which was never mentioned in Mr. Flinn's argument, and the commerce clause, that New York may insist that liquor prices to its wholesalers be as low as prices charged elsewhere in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.950" offset="7746937">The policy of lowest price affirmation which has been adopted in 39 states and which dates back to 1938 cannot be invalidated in this case based upon these speculative claims without the Court departing from its consistent interpretation of the core power of the Twenty-First Amendment, and without also departing from its consistent interpretation of the commerce clause, and this would be accomplished in a case where there is no record whatsoever to demonstrate any effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.854" offset="7890611">Brown-Forman's allegations are simplistic speculations about the benefits of free market forces in a liquor market which is otherwise restrained by pervasive regulation throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.141" offset="7943692">A free market in liquor that we have heard about today has not existed since prohibition, and it would not exist if the Court invalidated this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.398" offset="7980786">However, if the Court invalidated this statute based upon these claims, the states would have been punished for their reliance upon the Court's holding in Seagram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.776" offset="8022268">The states would be left to adopt truly burdensome alternatives to achieve the legitimate goals of price affirmation, the goals which this Court said were legitimate, and the states--</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.260" offset="8180152">The regulatory effect which Mr. Flinn has talked about without the support of any record, made out of whole cloth, is merely speculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.017" offset="8279208">First, that the affirmation law has the effect of preventing Brown-Forman and other distillers from making midmonth price changes, and second, that the affirmation law has the effect of preventing a distiller's pricing decision in other states, and there is nothing in the record about that, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.103" offset="9495574">--Well, Your Honor, this Court has always held that the states retain a residuum of power to enact regulations concerning matters of local concern which to some extent regulate commerce or affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.561" offset="9553357">But this type of presumed, speculative regulatory effect has never been considered burdensome by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.648" offset="9589719">In the Parker versus Brown case in 1943 the effect of the California prorate program in that case was to raise and stabilize the price of 95 percent of the country's raisins and one-half of the world's raisins, a very substantial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.057" offset="9651368">That was the Court's term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.238" offset="9656071">But that was not considered to be a burden on commerce under the Court's commerce clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.464" offset="9685014">In the case of Cities Service versus Peerless Oil in 1951, the Court was looking at a regulation which had the effect of doubling the price of natural gas at the wellhead, doubling the price demonstrated in the record, not like here, where we are speculating about what might happen, but a demonstrated doubling of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.234" offset="9760142">The Court held that that doubling of the wholesale price of natural gas did not constitute a burden on commerce under its commerce clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.101" offset="9799535">In the case of Exxon versus the Governor of Maryland, the Court observed that Maryland's divorcement law which prevented refiners from operating a gasoline station would probably have the effect of doing away with high volume, low priced gasoline stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.272" offset="9860244">The Court said that effect went to the wisdom of the statute, not to its burden on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.486" offset="9885112">So, there are regulations which have effects, demonstrated effects, where the Court has said 95 percent of the country's raisin prices have been raised, and they have obstructed the flow of raisins outside of California, but that is not a burden under the commerce clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.348" offset="9956583">But here, we have no record to show whether the prices have been raised in other states, whether the prices have gone down in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.962" offset="9986990">Mr. Flinn argued that he thinks that the harm has been done to New York consumers, because in a so-called free market, New York consumers would be the beneficiary of the lowest prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.380" offset="10040697">By taking this case under a facial challenge, without a record, the Court has given Mr. Flinn the opportunity to engage in wild speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.319" offset="10084479">Last week, in the decision of Fisher versus the City of Berkeley, this Court axiomatically stated something which if adhered to in this case should be the basis for the rejection of all these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.606" offset="10133589">In the Berkeley case, the Court refused to consider the challenge to Berkeley's rent control regulation as an attempt to monopolize under Section 2 of the Sherman Act because the effect of monopolization and the attempt at monopolization was not in the record, and it was not a result which clearly flowed from the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.179" offset="10219897">Now, in this case, there are two effects which Mr. Flinn is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.944" offset="10246960">He is talking about this prevention of making mid-month price changes, but Mr. Flinn's client didn't try to make a mid-month price change, and they were incited for violating the law in that regard, and no distiller has ever been cited for violating this law for making a mid-month price change in any other state, and the other effect which he talks about is this perversion of free market forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.861" offset="10590627">New York has an explicit statutory ban on liquor discounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.202" offset="10607973">We said, you can't do that here, but what you have to do, you simply have to decide how much this lowers the price of a bottle or a case of your liquor and then provide this to wholesalers on a cash basis, and that is precisely what was done with Seagram, another distiller, and the example which is cited in our brief, Seagram wanted to do the same type of promotional plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.848" offset="10702536">A waiver was provided under the good cause provision which Your Honor alluded to before in 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.224" offset="10732106">In 24 hours Seagram was given permission to cash out the discount and provide it on an equal basis to New York wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.561" offset="10777455">The perversion of free market forces which Brown-Forman alleges in this case goes something like this, and it has to go something like this because there is no record, but if a distiller did not have to suffer from the so-called inhibiting influence of the affirmation law, the distiller might charge a higher or lower price to a wholesaler in one of the eleven states that doesn't have an affirmation law, because 39 states do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.769" offset="10886229">And then that wholesaler would pass on that higher or lower price to a retailer, and then that retailer would pass on that higher or lower price to a consumer, and that consumer would benefit from the fact that the price he paid for that bottle of liquor was dictated by so-called free market forces rather than dictated by the so-called perverting influence of the affirmation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.897" offset="10986748">I can think of no more speculative, attenuated, and simplistic depiction of so-called free market forces in a market where there aren't any free market forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.143" offset="11147767">In cases where there was a free market, like Reeves versus State, I think, a 1982 decision of this Court, that was the ready-mix concrete market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.251" offset="11196146">When the plaintiff talked about the predicted benefits of free market forces, the Court characterized those predictions as being simple minded speculation, but at least there was a record in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.846" offset="11474506">This case is before the Court really almost by accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.469" offset="11489031">Brown-Forman began this case to challenge a wholly different practice and a different provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.283" offset="11512332">The interaction between New York's ban on liquor discounting and the affirmation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.408" offset="11532812">Along the way the Healey case was decided by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.111" offset="11551620">They got to the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court and they changed their rationale and they inserted this argument, but they inserted an argument that they have no stake in because they haven't been cited for violating the law in this regard, and they have no record to show that prices have gone up or down or there has been any perverting influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.693" offset="11641899">Now, one thing which has been missing, conspicuously missing from Mr. Flinn's argument is any mention of the other constitutional provision which is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.424" offset="11688815">This case calls the Court to reconcile a conflict between two parts of the same Constitution, and that other part of the Constitution, Your Honor, is the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.431" offset="11748897">Now, Mr. Flinn in his brief, although he has conspicuously avoided it in his argument, seems to suggest that the same rules apply, the same rules of the road apply in this case as in any other commerce clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.891" offset="11806679">Justice Friendly, who... sorry, Judge Friendly, who just wrote a decision upholding the posting requirements which were discussed by Mr. Flinn in the case of Battipuglia versus State Liquor Authority, and those posting requirements are part of the very same law that are issued here said for some of us who were present at the creation of the Twenty-First Amendment, there is an aura of unreality in plaintiff's assumption that we must examine the validity of New York's alcoholic beverage control law just as we would examine the constitutionality of a state statute governing the sale of gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.426" offset="11952861">What Judge Friendly was saying there is that a special rule applies in the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.659" offset="11977834">The Twenty-First Amendment was enacted--</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.261" offset="11996224">--Well, Your Honor, if the Court adheres to the rule in Seagram, the Court has to reject Brown-Forman's claim in this case, and this case really is a reargument of Seagram, because we have no additional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.150" offset="12047737">The Court said in Seagram, come back to this Court when you have demonstrated the actual extraterritorial effects that these statutes may produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.799" offset="12102386">Don't come back with a facial challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.270" offset="12112208">And we are back with a facial challenge, with no more information, with no record whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.657" offset="12137808">Mr. Flinn was discussing the change in the statute, the great change which occurred in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.569" offset="12161422">That great change was the change in the statute from a retrospective affirmation provision to a concurrent affirmation provision, and that was made because Brown-Forman and a bunch of other distillers went to the legislature and the Governor of the state of New York and said, we are being burdened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.050" offset="12231326">This provision is onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.741" offset="12242088">It prevents us from raising our prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.265" offset="12252224">Please change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.254" offset="12256195">So the legislature made that one change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.927" offset="12270823">It changed the law from a retrospective statute to a current statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.501" offset="12293184">At the time that they were supporting the change, they called it a current statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.444" offset="12308962">Now to characterize it invidiously, they call it a prospective statute, but obviously the prospectivity is merely an incident of the posting process which exists in eleven states by statute and in the eighteen other states by contractual warranties, but they said change this statute, so the legislature responded to them, and they changed the law, and they removed the only burden which is associated with a retrospective affirmation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.732" offset="12418049">So if the Court were not to overrule Seagram in this case but merely hold that a concurrent or contemporaneous statute was a burden on commerce, then the Court would be saying two things, one, go back to a more burdensome way of doing things, and the Court will be violating the single most important test which the Court has set out in the case of Pike versus Bruce Church, which is the test which sets up the balancing standard, the balance of interest between state and federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.170" offset="12531839">The most important part of that test is the search for the least burdensome alternative and a practical assessment of disallowing the state's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.767" offset="12570186">The assessment of the least burdensome alternative in this case would show clearly that the state has already adopted the least burdensome alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.392" offset="12604773">The state has adopted an alternative that is less burdensome because the distiller asked us to do that, and the state more specifically adopted the explicit holding in Seagram.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.710" offset="12650017">If you look at your holding in Seagram, you will see the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.862" offset="12670601">The statute does exactly what the holding says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.196" offset="12687946">It says, it insists that liquor prices to domestic wholesalers be as low as prices charged elsewhere in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.951" offset="12722951">The previous statute did not do that specifically because it merely tried to insist by referencing it to previously charged prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.427" offset="12764851">So now we have adopted this least burdensome alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.330" offset="12780524">What would be the practical result of disallowing this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.274" offset="12804244">New York, which was once the subject of price discrimination to the tune of $150 million a year, would likely become again the subject of price discrimination to the tune of $150 million a year, and the state would probably adopt a more burdensome approach to achieving a goal that has already been determined legitimate by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.039" offset="12891284">The Court said that the goal of price equality was a legitimate one, of ending price discrimination was a legitimate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.104" offset="12919600">And the Court has always said that protecting a consumer's pocketbook is as important as protecting any other interest of the state, as important as protecting the state's environment, which is what the Court said in Philadelphia versus New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.274" offset="12976234">So if the Court disallows this provision in the name of the commerce clause, it is going to be forcing the state to adopt a more burdensome alternative, and that burdensome alternative might take the form of a retrospective price affirmation statute, or it might take the form of price regulation, where the state actually gets into the business of setting prices and fixing prices or state maximum set prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.532" offset="13089292">And this Court has always considered those types of regulations to be legitimate over challenges under the substantive due process principles in Nevia versus the People of the State of New York, over commerce clause challenges in Cities Service versus Peerless Oil, over antitrust challenges just last week, in Fisher versus the City of Berkeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.026" offset="13175287">Now, to get back to the Twenty-First Amendment and the special rules that apply in this type of commerce clause case, because the Court has to resolve what may be a conflict between two sections of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.926" offset="13242892">I submit there is no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.257" offset="13248221">I submit in response to Justice Brennan's question that the Court can uphold the statute without ever reaching the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.212" offset="13279986">We don't need the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.045" offset="13287300">But if we get to the Twenty-First Amendment, we know that different rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.039" offset="13311333">The Twenty-First Amendment, second section, provides a test.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3296.441" offset="13328887">Do you think that the different rules apply after the Backus Imports case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd E. Constantine</label>
            <text syncTime="3300.645" offset="13345710">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.846" offset="13354591">All that Backus determined was that a state could not use its authority to control importation distribution for a wholly discriminatory purpose, and the Court said that Hawaii's action in the Backus case was not in furtherance of temperance or any other... any other legitimate core power of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.650" offset="13453752">Those other purposes are controlling the distribution of liquor within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.835" offset="13474546">The court has always held that the control of importation and distribution and the structuring of the liquor distribution system is the very essence of the Twenty-First Amendment power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.221" offset="13516028">That is what the Court said in Capital City Cable versus Crisp, which was the last case which was argued before this case under the Twenty-First Amendment, argued six weeks after the Backus decision which you have alluded to... argued six weeks after Backus was actually argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.102" offset="13579558">In that case there was a temperance-based regulation, a ban on advertising, and the Court said that the FCC's interest in their regulation of cable signals preempted Oklahoma's advertising ban, even though it was temperance based, because Oklahoma was not invoking the core power, and the core power was, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.311" offset="13688436">"the central power is exercising control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.136" offset="13723754">That is consistent with Backus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.587" offset="13733471">That is consistent with Seagram.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.157" offset="13739741">That is consistent with the Idlewild case of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.609" offset="13753638">It is consistent with the Heublin case of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.531" offset="13765236">It is consistent with the Midcal case, where the Court struck the California RPM system, but said California wasn't exercising the core power of the Twenty-First Amendment, but specifically referred to the Seagrams case as the case in which a state was exercising that core power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.684" offset="13837857">The Seagrams case has become synonymous with the core power under the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.447" offset="13860949">I mentioned before the Heublin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.390" offset="13868681">In that case you had what would otherwise have been a per se violation of the commerce clause, a requirement that a state... a requirement by the state of South Carolina that a distiller, Heublin, maintain a business presence in the state that it didn't want to, to do something which it could have done more efficiently in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.503" offset="13949138">In other contexts, the Court has disallowed that type of regulation, in Tumer against Whitsel, in Foster Fountain Packing versus Heidel, in Pike versus Bruce Church, in Johnson against Heidel, but special rules apply in the Twenty-First Amendment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.152" offset="14007757">Not only did the Twenty-First Amendment, that exercise of core power overcome what would otherwise be a per se violation of the commerce clause, but it overcame 15 USC Section 381(a), and Justice Blackmun in that case even indicated that the application of that section to the state in that case was unconstitutional, almost a reverse preemption argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.338" offset="14104515">So, a different rule applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.248" offset="14116113">The states are virtually unconstrained by traditional commerce clause considerations when they are acting within the core power of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.666" offset="14157804">I see that my time is just about up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.200" offset="14172015">And therefore, in summation, I would just like to say that the Court's commerce clause jurisprudence has been exemplified by its flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.662" offset="14201795">It is not an exercise in absolutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.703" offset="14209945">There is nothing which foreordains one result or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.407" offset="14220812">But the Court should not extend the concept of burden on commerce which would be true in this case for the first time to a so-called suspension of free market forces in a case where there is no record, no discrimination, no direct regulation of interstate commerce, and no free market, and the reason there is no free market is because the states are exercising their core power under the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.796" offset="14334392">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.499" offset="14365112">I would make simply this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.342" offset="14372531">If the Court agreed with us that New York's present statute prospectively reaches out and controls minimum prices that can be charged in other states, there is no necessity to show what has in fact happened, whether prices have been raised in other states while lowered in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.643" offset="14449749">There is no necessity to show the competitive arguments which we make because we believe that they inevitably flow from such extraterritorial regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.861" offset="14490604">To the contrary, if there is such an extraterritorial projection by New York of its legislation, its minimum prizes elsewhere, that is a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and no further showing is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.169" offset="14551835">As Justice White wrote in Might against Edgar, where a state projects its legislation outside its borders and attempts to regulate transactions which have nothing to do with that state, there is nothing to be weighed in the balance to sustain the regulating state's act.</text>
