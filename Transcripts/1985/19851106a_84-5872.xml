            <text syncTime="15.322" offset="206745">I must begin by confessing that the facts of this case are much less exciting than the two cases previously heard by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.584" offset="239764">Indeed, the facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.084" offset="249795">A state prisoner in Virginia, a prisoner in the Richmond City Jail to be exact, filed a suit in Federal District Court alleging that he was injured while he was incarcerated in the Richmond City Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.219" offset="302353">And, he alleged specifically that he slipped on a pillow which was on some newspapers on the stairs in the jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="50.450" offset="347284">Mr. Chief Justice, it sounds like a negligence case and both parties have treated it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.228" offset="370376">The facts hardly look like facts that would support a federal action or a case that this Court should spend its time on, but, in fact, this case and these facts really are a messenger of major issue and how the Court decides that issue will be of great importance to everyone incarcerated in any jail or prison in any state in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.047" offset="457625">And, that issue, simply put, is whether or not persons who are incarcerated have a right to be cared for, have their persons protected by those who have been entrusted with their safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.946" offset="537246">Not only yes, but a very important part of our argument will be that the reason why we urge that there was a duty upon the state to provide some kind of compensation for a prisoner who can prove that he was, in fact, injured while in custody is that is part of the due process of law the person is entitled to when he is incarcerated as a person may be under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.373" offset="634944">The Court of Appeals sitting en banc decided three questions, all adverse to the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.182" offset="666187">It decided by a five to four vote that this Court's decision in Parratt v. Taylor which had held that a prisoner could bring a suit seeking compensation for a negligent deprivation of property, as long as there was no meaningful state remedy, that Parratt did not apply to liberty interest, did not apply to injuries to the person, and that a prisoner had no right to sue in federal court for injuries to his person even if no state remedy were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.374" offset="774961">An unanimous Court of Appeals, nine-zero, held that Parratt... another holding, that the Parratt case ought to apply to liberty and property interests, meaning that even if it were wrong concerning protection of the person, that if a meaningful remedy were available in state court that for this kind of injury a prisoner could not sue in federal court under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.913" offset="865135">Finally, a six to three split on the court held that there was a meaningful remedy in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.050" offset="885615">This afternoon I would like to concede at the outset one of the major points decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.454" offset="915290">We do not quarrel with the holding of the Court of Appeals, the nine to nothing holding, which is Parratt applies in cases in which a prisoner is claiming that he was injured as a result of the tortious conduct of a safety officer while in custody and whether that tort is negligence or an intentional tort, not an independent violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.242" offset="1002435">But, we concede that the Parratt reasoning ought to apply, if, indeed, a meaningful remedy were available in state court for this Petitioner, this Petitioner ought not to be able to proceed with the Section 1983 action.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.237" offset="1054366">Mr. Saltzburg, can you explain why you think the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were concerned with possible state law negligence actions by state officers?</text>

            <text syncTime="245.994" offset="1129390">Perhaps I can explain or answer that best this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.759" offset="1144541">The drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the 1866 and 1871 Civil Rights statutes which enforced the Fourteenth Amendment plainly had in mind, as this Court has noted several times in the legislative history cited in Monroe v. Pape and Mitchum versus Foster, that one of the evils that gave rise to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights statutes was the problem of law enforcement officers, sheriffs as well as courts, failing to do what was necessary to protect people in their--</text>

            <text syncTime="275.170" offset="1246105">Well, failing to act consciously by reference to the word "deprive", don't we have to look at that word in the clause and inquire whether the ordinary meaning of the word "deprive" means an intentional rather than a unintentional kind of an act or discrimination?</text>

            <text syncTime="307.890" offset="1377031">One is the Court has looked at the meaning of the word v.

            <label>Mr. Stephen Allan Saltzburg</label>
            <text syncTime="330.976" offset="1469400">Yes, Justice Blackmun, that was a property case.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.771" offset="1480580">Ours is a liberty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.771" offset="1484551">In a moment I will argue liberty deserves as much protection as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.925" offset="1505135">But, Justice O'Connor, there is also a second answer and I think that before the Court is an argument implicit, I suppose, in this case, but almost explicit, that maybe Parratt ought to be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.372" offset="1554977">Maybe the Court should take another look.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.418" offset="1563127">And, we had anticipated that and briefed it and I intend to argue that too, that even if the Court looks again, that Parratt was indeed correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.556" offset="1591653">The first point that I would... There are three major points I would like to argue and that is, Justice Blackmun, as you said, the first point is that liberty interests deserve as much protection at least as property interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.709" offset="1636270">The second point is that negligent deprivations should be deemed to be within Section 1983 when prisoners are in custody and in control of state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.846" offset="1676812">And, the third point is that there was no meaningful remedy within the meaning of Parratt and the Chief Justice's opinion for the Court in Hudson v. Palmer in Virginia state courts at the time this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.387" offset="1722996">On the first point, whether liberty interests should be given as much protection as property interests, this argument... the argument I make is the one that I believe finds strong support in virtually everything this Court usually looks at in rendering decisions on the law, on constitutional law and the meaning of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.864" offset="1800946">The history of the Civil Rights Statute is a history set forth at some length in Monroe versus Pape and Mitchum v. Foster and it is a history of a Congress concerned with the abuse of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.390" offset="1847026">It is true that property sometimes was damaged when people were deprived of their rights, but it is a history that speaks eloquently about people.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.106" offset="1873880">The language of the Civil Rights Act does not mention the word "property".</text>
            <text syncTime="435.870" offset="1888926">It speaks about interest protected, the rights protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.071" offset="1913795">Even if the Court somehow were to want to draw a line between liberty and property, as the four dissenting judges said in the court below, surely the person would come out on top in any rational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.049" offset="1969697">And, indeed, drawing the line between liberty and property is not only difficult, but it may be unnecessary in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.829" offset="1996760">It is the deprivation of good time wrongfully, a deprivation of property or liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.123" offset="2014001">It is the failure to process properly a claim of employment discrimination which this Court has confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.245" offset="2042422">Is that a liberty claim or a property claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="475.854" offset="2048900">Our point is it should not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.104" offset="2057886">Indeed, there is a tragic irony in the argument that was made by the majority of the Court of Appeals, an argument that is repeated by the Respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.927" offset="2097174">Prior to the Civil War and prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court was called upon to decide whether certain people and classes of people were people or property and the Court said property.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.518" offset="2139493">A war was fought, an amendment was adopted, and statutes were enacted to correct that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.781" offset="2160600">And, now, the Court of Appeals has held that certain people don't even qualify even as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.340" offset="2186827">They don't get as much protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.573" offset="2195708">In our view, that decision flies in the face of the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.884" offset="2212949">It ignores the decisions of this Court which has emphasized the history of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.758" offset="2228518">It flies in the face of logic and it is wrong as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.131" offset="2245968">That is the easiest point in our view that we have to make this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.114" offset="2265925">The second point is the more difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.049" offset="2281703">It is made more difficult by the fact that in the case that follows this, the Solicitor General of the United States will argue to the Court that it should not only reconsider Parratt, but it should reject the holding of Parratt v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.888" offset="2333008">Thus, Justice O'Connor, I would like to reach the question you asked which is was the Court correct when a majority of the justices in the Parratt case said that, indeed, a negligent deprivation could be a deprivation of property within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, within the reach of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.302" offset="2406673">It is not our contention that every state tort gives rise to a civil rights action under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.875" offset="2448992">Were we to have to argue that, we could not win.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.656" offset="2464038">Indeed, the end of the Parratt opinion contains a reference to an automobile accident involving a state officer and the same majority that had decided Parratt suggested that surely that alone could not warrant a suit under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.211" offset="2522343">The Solicitor General would be right if, in fact, we were asking this Court to say every time there was an injury at the hands of a state officer that there had to be a remedy, a damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.427" offset="2567170">You would have to overrule every notion of sovereign immunity that has been in effect both before and after the Civil Rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.332" offset="2590784">We ask this and only this, that this Court recognize what it said in 1856 in South versus Maryland; that there has been a common-law duty on the part of officers into whose custody prisoners have been placed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.012" offset="2657553">The officers have been held responsible in damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.719" offset="6768286">This is a garden variety slip and fall case, a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.124" offset="6785945">It occurred in a jail and it caused bodily injury to a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.200" offset="6802245">It was said to have occurred due to the simple negligence of a deputy sheriff leaving a pillow and some newspapers on the stairs used by the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.947" offset="6833279">We wish today to address by way of argument two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.805" offset="6848639">Our first point is that an act of simple negligence by a deputy sheriff causing unintended bodily injury should not constitute a deprivation of liberty in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.284" offset="6894614">Our second point is that even if an act of simple negligence constitutes a deprivation in the constitutional sense, a state law defense such as the defense of sovereign immunity, does not violate due process when it operates to preclude recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.372" offset="6958980">We believe that the Petitioner here has assumed that as a prisoner his interest in freedom from personal injury is a liberty interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause and we believe that this assumption of his is based largely upon the fact of his incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.834" offset="7020838">As a result of his incarceration, he believes that a special duty is owed to him to keep him absolutely free of tortious injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.081" offset="7053752">He argues that an act of simple negligence by a deputy sheriff in this case constitutes a deprivation of this liberty interest and he argues that there is, in fact, an absolute state defense of sovereign immunity such that no state recovery would be allowed, therefore, he has concluded that this deprivation has occurred without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.401" offset="7139016">We submit that if the Petitioner's basic argument is accepted, almost any negligent tort that is committed by a guard or a deputy sheriff, depending on the availability of a state tort remedy, could be considered a deprivation of a liberty interest without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.018" offset="7209547">For example, if a prison guard or a deputy sheriff could have an automobile accident resulting from his simple negligence when he is taking a prisoner to or from court for a hearing, if an injury has occurred to that prisoner and there is no adequate state remedy, then it can be said that a deprivation of a liberty interest has occurred in that set of facts.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Walter Hopper</label>
            <text syncTime="2876.976" offset="11653393">And, the legislature would make that determination at some point in its deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.349" offset="11670843">In the recent case, however, of Messina versus Burden, the Virginia Supreme Court has stated that sovereign immunity serves a multitude of government interest in this case and these include not only those that Petitioner alluded to earlier, which was protecting the public purse, but a number of others, among which were eliminating public inconvenience and danger that might spring from officials being fearful to act, assuring that citizens would be willing to take public jobs and also preventing citizens from improperly influencing the conduct of governmental affairs through threat or the use of vexatious litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.976" offset="11809396">The Virginia court has also noted that government can only function through servants such as this deputy sheriff and that certain of those servants much enjoy the same immunity in the performance of those discretionary functions as the government enjoys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.877" offset="11861014">Given the continued validity of the sovereign immunity doctrine in Virginia, the Virginia Supreme Court has acknowledged that it must continue to engage in a very difficult task of deciding which government employees are entitled to immunity based on the nature of their acts, either discretionary or ministerial, on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.136" offset="11934053">Such rationale, we believe, reflects what Virginia considers to be some of the important purposes of the immunity defense which benefits society as a whole in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.725" offset="11972401">The balance of state and private interests favors the government's interest in this sense and it is rashly related to a legitimate state interest, that of jail or prison administration in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.393" offset="12019003">It has been held that immunity rules do not in and of themselves deny due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.360" offset="12034885">We believe that such rules do not deny process simply by limiting the state remedy available to this Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.372" offset="12058918">We believe that to agree with Petitioner that his procedural due process rights have been violated by the immunity defense would result in common law torts becoming Section 1983 cases in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.868" offset="12104894">The constitutional question then is whether state procedures, including sovereign immunity defenses, provide the Petitioner with the process required under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.599" offset="12143868">We urge this Court to conclude that Virginia's procedures in this case do, in fact, comply with the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.074" offset="12241775">It is true, Justice White, that a majority of six of the Court of Appeals expressed the view that there were several Virginia Supreme Court cases which would suggest that there wouldn't be sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.787" offset="12280645">It is also true that Respondent's position was and is that there is sovereign immunity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.426" offset="12303215">An assistant attorney general, arguing companion cases which were argued together with this and questions were put, indicated that he supported the view there was sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.081" offset="12473743">This has gone to a jury, traditional jury trial in the circuit court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.704" offset="12492237">A general verdict might never have declared whether there was or was not sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.617" offset="12579904">And, the question we put to this Court is whether it is truly a meaningful remedy when the Petitioner judges that the sovereign immunity defense is likely to succeed, the Respondent believes it will succeed, his counsel believes it will succeed, he so represents to the court--</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.726" offset="12740401">The last point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Martinez case is cited a great length in the brief, although not here in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.644" offset="12764015">This Court carefully left open in Martinez the question of what kind of immunity would be recognized for 1983 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.220" offset="12794317">It did not, as suggested in the brief, say that state immunity would automatically be accepted if they were rational.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.716" offset="12840293">The last thing I would say is this case may boil down to this and when the Court judges first question put by Respondent as to what the intent of the Congress was when it enacted Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.226" offset="12882402">His position is that if a prisoner in the custody of a sheriff were negligently stolen away and lynched, there would have been no remedy in a federal court even after the state courts' doors were closed.</text>
