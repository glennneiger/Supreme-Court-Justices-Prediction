            <text syncTime="68.660" offset="401138">The principal issue before this Court is whether Pennsylvania's Mandatory Sentencing Act violates due process of law because it provides for proof by only a preponderance of the evidence of the legislatively specified defense-related facts which require the imposition of a mandatory sentence of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="474908">The Mandatory Act provides that if a defendant is convicted of one of the numerated list of felonies, the Commonwealth may give notice of its intention to proceed under that act rather than Pennsylvania's discretionary sentencing scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.085" offset="654839">At that hearing there is but one issue, the same issue that is normally at a criminal trial, and the issue is did the defendant commit the prohibited conduct which the state wishes to punish?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.810" offset="705726">In this case, the question is did defendant visibly possess a firearm during the commission of criminal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.375" offset="1527956">In fact, there was a recent case... it is not in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.477" offset="1540390">It was just reported last week, Commonwealth v. Storm, at 502 Atlantic 2d, 215, a Superior Court case where defendant pled guilty to robbing a bank at gunpoint and the judge proceeded to impose the mandatory sentence of five to ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.820" offset="1601726">The Superior Court reversed because the Superior Court held that under this statutory scheme, the defendant was denied the hearing at sentencing where either side could present evidence, and the determination as to be made whether there was proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.132" offset="1667032">We would have no complaint if this statute, like all the other statutes across this country, I have attached as appendixes to my brief, the way this is normally done in every state in this country, the way it has always been done, when this factual determination determines a more severe punishment, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required, and it doesn't matter what form such a statute takes, whether it is explicitly an element of the offense, such as an armed robbery statute, or whether it's a separate offense, such as a prohibition against committing a felony with a firearm, or whether it's part of a penalty provision, for example, Section 924 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code that's entitled "Penalties" and it provides for increased punishment if a defendant committed an offense with a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.513" offset="1856577">Under all these kinds of statutes, historically and consistently it's been recognized proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required, and that's because this is an essential, critical fact in the manner in which the crime was committed which in the eyes of the legislature, the legislature has determined makes the offense more serious and which makes the penalty for the offense more serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.728" offset="1957409">Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which has passed a similar act, stand alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.561" offset="3004710">We have sentences here ranging from 11 1/2 to 23 months imprisonment on the low end, to four to eight years.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.321" offset="3059777">The essential difference between a discretionary sentencing scheme where a judge considers a whole host of factors, indeed, must in deciding on a proper sentence to impose, and this sentencing scheme, is it is nothing like these other sentencing schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.580" offset="3124769">It is simply like a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.366" offset="3131979">There is only one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.482" offset="3136368">The issue is did the defendant commit the prohibited conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="756.401" offset="3152041">In essence, what Pennsylvania has done here is they have set up a bifurcated trial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.222" offset="3171372">You first determine at trial, for purpose of this act, beyond a reasonable doubt did the defendant commit a robbery, and then you take the tradition element of the offense, was he armed, and you determine that after trial by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.915" offset="3230199">That is all that has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.099" offset="3238872">Once we get beyond the label of sentencing, it's a lot like the Winship case.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.885" offset="3257994">In Winship there was a claim it's a juvenile adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.789" offset="3273667">It's only civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.689" offset="3281295">Therefore there's no need for the reasonable doubt standard, and what this Court did is it examined the operation of the statute, and the operation of the adjudicatory scheme for juveniles was that a juvenile was accused of committing conduct which the state wished to punish, essentially a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.286" offset="3355587">And if those facts were found, if those facts were established, then confinement could result as a proof of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.773" offset="3385576">That is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.856" offset="3393935">We have only one issue at this hearing, the issue, did he do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="821.777" offset="3413579">Did he commit the conduct the state wishes to punish?</text>
            <text syncTime="825.129" offset="3426954">And if in fact those facts were established, the Judge has no choice the inevitable consequences follow just like at a trial, five to ten years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.369" offset="3471989">If in fact in a situation like this the constitutional line is not drawn here and Pennsylvania is permitted to do this, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, aside from the whole trend of our jurisprudence, there is really no place to draw the constitutional line because in essence, and in Mullaney v. Wilbur, this Court emphasized this, this Court emphasized the problem that a state might take the traditional element of the offense, the state might transpose that traditional element of the offense into a sentencing statute where it had the exact same effect on the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.444" offset="9072224">It's no line at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.244" offset="9075463">If the Commonwealth is correct, then our robbery statutes can be rewritten just like this statute to provide that beyond a reasonable doubt is required for proof that a defendant stole something, but the penalty of five to ten years would be mandated if at sentencing it is shown that there was force, physical force used in the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.341" offset="9155816">They could take every traditional statute, take an aggravated assault statute which provides that the elements of the offense are that somebody struck somebody and serious bodily injury occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.482" offset="9200433">According to the Commonwealth's theory, since that did not involve mens rea the seriousness of the injury, you could take that fact out and put it in a sentencing statute; it would have the exact same effect on a defendant but on a lower burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.056" offset="9254663">I think if we talk about a slippery slope here, the slippery slope is if this act is upheld because then basically, constitutionally, anything goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.746" offset="9289458">It will not affect in any way traditional discretionary sentencing hearings for this Court to hold this act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.752" offset="9321537">A judge will be free, as he always has been free, and as the judges in these very cases did, to consider at sentencing every important factor, including if defendant had a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.207" offset="9363332">Each of these cases the judge considered all of the factors mandated by a discretionary scheme, and in each case the defendant received a sentence of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.563" offset="9400740">However, what he did not receive is a mandated sentence of imprisonment based on proof by a preponderance of the evidence without a jury determination to critical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.771" offset="9437520">Thank you.</text>
