            <label>Mr. Peter Greenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="104.520" offset="554131">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Court is asked to construe Section 2331 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, or OBRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.248" offset="629050">In OBRA, Congress established the tax intercept program for collecting child support owed to state welfare agencies, and it directed the Secretary of the Treasury to intercept "refunds of federal taxes paid" payable to certain individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.082" offset="724345">What this Court is asked to decide is whether Congress authorized the interception of earned income credit benefits when it directed the interception of refunds of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.012" offset="792054">It is petitioner's contention that it did not authorize interception of earned income credit benefits, and that was also the holding of the Second Circuit in Nelson versus Regan and the Tenth Circuit in Bucker versus the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.708" offset="854852">We are here because the Ninth Circuit ruled the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.253" offset="873034">There are three points that I would like to emphasize this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.158" offset="892678">The first is that the statutory phrase "refunds of federal taxes paid" is a distinctive and unambiguous phrase which literally does not encompass earned income credit benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.260" offset="957043">The second is that the structure of Section 2331 of OBRA is inconsistent with the broad reading the Secretary has given to Section 6402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.613" offset="1018483">And the third and perhaps most important point is that when Congress enacted Section 2331, it was concerned with support for children and with reducing the cost of the AFPC program, and it would have made no sense in that context to fund support for one group of needy children aided under the AFDC program by taking benefits from another group of children, perhaps as needy or more needy who because their parents were working were assisted under the earned income credit benefit program.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.005" offset="1956070">Now, the phrase "refunds of federal taxes paid" appears nowhere in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.032" offset="1996194">So far as we are aware, it was used for the first time in a federal statute in Section 2331.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.139" offset="2024616">The term "refund", of course, is used frequently, and it is a term that is used to refer to any payment made through the tax refund process.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.791" offset="2063172">All such refunds, payments made through that process, correspond to federal taxes actually paid with one exception, and that exception is the earned income credit benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.738" offset="2118970">One need not have owed any tax or paid any tax in order to be eligible for this cash payment, and as the government concedes, earned income credit benefits do not correspond to taxes actually paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.309" offset="2337249">And to help do that, I have asked the clerk to distribute to you on the eight-and-a-half-by-fourteen page the full text of Section 2331 in which both of these provisions originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.944" offset="2383747">Now, you will notice that in Subsection (a) of 2331 Congress established the tax intercept program.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.629" offset="2430558">We contend that this is really the basic text of the program, and it is an unambiguously limited authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.453" offset="2465876">That is, it only applies to refunds of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.982" offset="2479982">In Subsection (b) of 2331, Congress imposed an obligation on states to participate in the tax intercept program.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.166" offset="2536720">Now, having done that much, the program was in place, and I have been asked before in this case why was it necessary to go and add Subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="614.456" offset="2593876">The reason it was necessary is that at that point there would have been conflicting obligations imposed on the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.407" offset="2621670">That is, the Secretary was told in the Social Security Act as amended to intercept certain refunds whereas under Section 6402, prior to its amendment, these same refunds were to be paid through a taxpayer, and so it was necessary in order to reconcile the Internal Revenue Code to amend the part of the quote that dealt with overpayments, namely, 6402.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.003" offset="2747998">However, there is no reason to read Section 6402 as granting authority that is any broader than that which is included in 464 of the Social Security Act, Subsection (a), and the express language of 6402(c) as emphasized by the Courts of Appeal, with the exception of the Ninth Circuit, says that overpayments are to be reduced, but in accordance with Section 464 of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.564" offset="3066274">Let me turn to the issue of Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.936" offset="3103786">As I said earlier, when Congress adopted 2331 of OBRA, it was concerned about support of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.259" offset="3161047">It was also concerned with reducing the cost of the AFDC program, but this was not clearly its exclusive concern because the easiest way to do that would have been to simply cut back the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.597" offset="3214441">It would have made no sense in considering how to fund a program designed to help needy children to simply dip into benefits that Congress only a few years earlier had established for another group of needy children whose parents worked, and rob those children to fund a program for another set of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.835" offset="3335336">It would have frustrated all of the purposes of the earned income credit benefit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.316" offset="3357278">The work incentive purpose elaborated in the Senate report referred to in our briefs obviously would be eliminated if earned income credit benefits were interceptable, because, of course, AFDC benefits are exempt, and the less emphasized purpose of stimulating the economy would also have been lessened if the money wasn't paid to these needy families, and presumably promptly used.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.618" offset="4270519">That's correct, Justice Stevens, and the reason for this seemingly rather awkward phrasing, and that is that while the money is held by the Treasury it isn't yet a refund, so it is an amount that would be a refund if it were paid, but while held by the Treasury it is technically simply an accounting item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.966" offset="4387861">So, it was appropriate to refer to amounts as refunds of federal taxes paid payable to such individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.353" offset="4421403">Now, earlier in this case, the government characterized the phrase "refunds of federal taxes paid" as ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.224" offset="4456929">Our position is, it is not ambiguous.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Farber</label>
            <text syncTime="1111.836" offset="4583362">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three points I would like to make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.631" offset="4610529">The first one is that the decision below is in accord with both the language of the Social Security Act and the concurrent provisions in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.752" offset="4651071">Moreover, the decision below is the only one that makes sense in light of the overall statutory scheme enacted by Congress for dealing with this increasing problem of non-payment of child support obligations, and finally, there are no considerations of social policy that provide any basis for ignoring the clear mandate of the statutory provisions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.352" offset="4741455">The petitioner in this case has tried hard to read the intercept provisions as applying only to actual refunds of taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.583" offset="4782310">Now, if that were the language and the intent of Congress, there wouldn't be much to argue about this morning, because it is quite clear that earned income credits are not actual refunds of taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.248" offset="4836958">However, the language employed by Congress does not say refunds of taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.294" offset="4857229">The petitioner tries very hard to ignore the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which form part of the intercept provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.011" offset="4888054">They were enacted concurrently with the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.791" offset="4899130">The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code speak in terms of overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.037" offset="4928178">Any overpayment may be intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.303" offset="4937269">That is what Section 6402(c) says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.192" offset="4948763">Section 6401(b) expressly defines an excess earned income credit, meaning the extent to which the credit exceeds the tax liability, as an overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.327" offset="4997350">When you put these two sections together, the obvious conclusion is that earned income credits may be intercepted because they are overpayments, and Section 6402(c) by its express terms refers to any overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.698" offset="5050849">The position taken by the petitioner also results in an inconsistency within Section 6402 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.490" offset="5089928">6402(a) is the provision which authorizes the Commissioner to make refunds of overpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.611" offset="5122425">In fact, it directs the Secretary to refund any overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.891" offset="5139561">Now, if an earned income credit were not an overpayment, it couldn't be refunded at all, and this issue could never have arisen, so it must be conceded, and both the Second and Tenth Circuits have conceded that earned income credits are overpayments for purposes of Subsection (a) of Section 6402 and therefore may be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.727" offset="5222944">However, when Congress enacted the intercept program in 1981, it specifically amended Section 6402(a) to provide that the Secretary's obligation to refund an overpayment under that subsection is subject to the provisions of Subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.016" offset="5296087">Now, that is the express cross reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.953" offset="5303819">And Subsection (c), of course, specifically says that in the case of any overpayment due to a person who is indebted for past due child support, the amount of the overpayment is to be reduced by the amount of the past due support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.213" offset="5356900">In light of this integrated statutory scheme, there is simply no way to maneuver out of the conclusion that earned income credits, since they are overpayments under the code, are subject to interception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.538" offset="6518199">As far as I am aware, Justice Stevens, Congress did not mention earned income credit one way or the other when it passed the intercept program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.769" offset="6551114">Our position, of course, is that its language was so all-encompassing that it necessarily includes earned income credits because of the way that the code is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.530" offset="6586118">The position of the petitioner and of the Second and Tenth Circuits in the Nelson and Bucker cases is based exclusively on the language of a parallel provision, Section 464 of the Social Security Act, which was enacted concurrently with Section 6402(c) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.117" offset="6660514">They read this provision as authorizing only interceptions of actual tax refunds, and they say that is... and earned income credit is not an actual tax refund, and that is the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.394" offset="6709625">Of course, their position requires ignoring the parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which speaks clearly in terms of overpayment, so their position requires creating an inconsistency between two concurrent provisions which were part of the same program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.700" offset="6770856">In our view, the interpretation of the court below is correct and avoids any inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.571" offset="6798336">The court below read Section 464 as applied not to just tax refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.913" offset="6827698">The section says, in the case of any amounts as refunds of taxes paid which are payable, and in our view the only logical interpretation, judging in light of the concurrent provisions of Section 6402(c) is, is that Congress meant that any amounts payable as refunds of taxes paid are subject to interception, and there is no question that earned income credits are payable as refunds of taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.212" offset="6940860">That is the only way they can be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.978" offset="6947966">There is no other authority under which the Secretary could make a refund of an earned income credit other than the fact that it is treated under the code as an overpayment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.740" offset="6994986">In our view, there is no inconsistency between these two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.300" offset="7013167">They both apply to amounts payable as refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.267" offset="7025079">Earned income credits are payable as refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.766" offset="7035110">We think this conclusion becomes even more apparent when one looks at an antecedent provision enacted in 1975, and that is Section 6305 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.933" offset="7083698">That was enacted as part of the Social Services Amendment of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.776" offset="7103133">Under that provision, Congress authorized and directed the Secretary of the Treasury upon receiving certification from HHS through the states to collect child support that had been assigned to a state as if it were a delinquent federal employment tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.206" offset="7176798">Delinquent taxes may be collected out of any property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer and may be collected from any means, including levy and... liens, tax sales, and other means available to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.451" offset="7241791">Although there are few exemptions of property interests that may not be collected for federal taxes, there is no exemption for earned income credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.555" offset="7282229">Thus, it is perfectly clear that when Congress enacted 6305, it authorized the collection, the seizure, if the Court will, of earned income credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.645" offset="7322562">Once they have been actually paid out by the Treasury and are in the hands of the recipient, the IRS could turn around once the matter was certified and seize those credits back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.980" offset="10507933">I believe it is, but maybe more principally to try and collect against those people who have no intention of voluntarily paying, and there is a huge amount out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.570" offset="10546281">I would give the Court some figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.929" offset="10555685">During the first three and a half years of the intercept program, the total amount of tax refunds that have been intercepted are approaching or may be slightly in excess of $900 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.924" offset="10603750">Of this amount, the earned income credit component is estimated to be somewhere between 15 to 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.076" offset="10632276">So, the intercept program has been quite successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.793" offset="10651189">We are only talking about one small part of it here, the earned income credit component, but the overall program has collected some $900 million that otherwise may not have been collected, and the figures indicate that the amount of the interceptions are increasing at an increasing rate each year, so in future years the collections may be even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.613" offset="10742513">One other point I would like to make, that this case has been painted sort of as a battle against a poor individual versus the state, but in 1984, Congress has expanded the intercept program to allow collection, interception of refunds on behalf of children who aren't on AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.352" offset="10837389">Now, these children may be quite needy and it may well be that if these collections are made they won't have to go on AFDC, and these amounts that will be collected beginning in January of '86 will not go to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.676" offset="10886709">The state will receive them from the IRS, but they will pay them out to individual families, and the court's decision here will directly impact on this later amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.359" offset="10933416">If the court should hold that earned income credits are immune under the intercept program, then they couldn't be paid for these individuals as well as paid to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.636" offset="10966539">So the decision here is quite far-reaching, but the expansion to individual cases once again shows Congress's concern in this area to stop the... or put a halt to the increasing problem of non-payment of child support and to stop the growth of AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.770" offset="11043130">It is felt that by enforcing child support payments from people who have not yet gone on AFDC, that it may stop them from having to apply for welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.765" offset="11243123">I would like to talk a little bit more about Section 6402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, because I think the problem of reconciling that with what we take to be the clear provision of 464 of the Social Security Act seems to have been the focus of some discussion, and there is a phrase in 6402(c) that has simply been ignored by the Secretary, and that is the phrase,</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.172" offset="11388678">So, it says, that is, 6402(c) says, "overpayments shall be reduced", and we acknowledge that it is probably appropriate to treat in this context earned income credit benefits as overpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.118" offset="11456491">It is possible to distinguish two classes of overpayments, but it is not necessary, because it goes on to say, they shall be reduced in accordance with Section 464 of the Social Security Act, so if--</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.971" offset="12011855">It requires the Secretary to intercept such refunds of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.466" offset="12041843">Let me speak a little bit about Section 6305.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.401" offset="12069638">As Justice Stevens correctly observed, there is no indication that it has ever been used to take an earned income credit benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.742" offset="12106940">There is another important difference between Section 6305, which we have called the alternative collection method, and the intercept method, and that is that states are required to use the intercept method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.299" offset="12165246">That is, if a debt is owed to a state, it is required to certify the name of a debtor to the Secretary of the Treasury, regardless of whether the state would want to collect against the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.731" offset="12210908">For example, in petitioner's case, while it is true there is no dispute that petitioner's husband owed child support to the state, it is also undisputed that he was disabled, and that he and his wife and a dependent child living on very low income, it would have been entirely appropriate for the state to determine that that isn't an appropriate case to pursue collection in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.113" offset="12308501">However, they were required to use the intercept program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.789" offset="12415185">But it does say... 464 says at the beginning, upon receiving notice from a state agency administering... so it certainly refers to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Greenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="3077.629" offset="12446532">It refers to notice several times; also at the end of 464(a) it refers to notice, but 464(a) is imposing an obligation on the Secretary, and when the Secretary complies with that obligation, he is acting in accordance with Section 464(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.560" offset="12518212">When a state gives notice to the Secretary, the state is acting in accordance with Section 454, and in accordance with whatever regulations require notice, but it is not acting in accordance with 464 because no obligation is imposed by 464.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.693" offset="12590833">Now, if there were no other way of making sense out of this statute, it might be tempting to strain to say that is... that these oblique references to notice are what was referred to in 6402(c), but there is no need to strain in that way, because there is a perfectly acceptable interpretation which gives meaning to the primary text in Section 2331 of OBRA, that is, Subsection (a), which creates and establishes the tax intercept program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.287" offset="12745164">There has been reference also in respect to 6305 to its being more cumbersome, and that is the reason that it isn't used, and as this Court very well knows, the collection methods available to the IRS are perhaps among the least cumbersome collection methods known in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.194" offset="12884763">They are extraordinary powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.427" offset="12889674">And the reason, we submit, that it is not so frequently used is that in many respects it is simply duplicative of state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.923" offset="12927708">States have programs to collect child support, and if the debtor is in the state, it is rarely necessary to invoke the assistance of the Secretary of the Treasury in order to garnish wages or seize property or use any of those kinds of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.932" offset="13003776">So, 6305 would simply be used, for example, if the debtor were out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.663" offset="13026660">But it also, since it is discretionary, since a state need not use it, it allows the state to do its collection business in what we would submit is a more appropriate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.612" offset="13074411">And to give one example, one of the class members in this case filed a declaration explaining that her husband had an agreement with the state to make payments toward a child support obligation, and he was current in his obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.778" offset="13135120">Now, nonetheless, he had an outstanding debt, so the state was required to certify his name, and his refund was intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.757" offset="13175035">However, the state would not be required... in that case I should emphasize it was only a refund of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.099" offset="13208367">It was not under an income credit benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.504" offset="13217980">However, the state would not have been required and surely would not have asked the Secretary to use the 6305 procedure because in exercise of its discretion and also its responsibility under the agreement it would have made its arrangement with the debtor and it would follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.919" offset="13287675">So, there are many good reasons for the relative little use of Section 6305.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.947" offset="13319754">In conclusion, let me simply say that there is a clear statutory provision before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.052" offset="13360191">It is in the first section of 2331.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.113" offset="13372416">It authorizes the interception of refunds of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.424" offset="13389762">As the Secretary concedes, earned income credit benefits are not refunds of federal taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.593" offset="13414421">There is no need to strain the statutory language when the only result is to take benefits from a particularly needy group of children.</text>
