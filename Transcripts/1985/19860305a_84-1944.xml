            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.137" offset="275038">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.458" offset="288308">This case is here on direct appeal, somewhat unusual for a tax case, because the district court declared a provision of the Revenue Code unconstitutional as a retroactive law that deprives Appellees of property without due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.170" offset="359152">In their brief on the merits Appellees, while not abandoning this constitutional theory, seem to place greater reliance upon the statutory construction argument, a variant of which they presented below, but which the district court did not pass upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.162" offset="423100">Before talking about either of these arguments, I'd like to explain briefly how the challenged statute works, which is a little bit complicated in some ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="465418">The challenged statute is Section 210(c) of the Revenue Code, which Congress enacted in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.524" offset="496556">This is one example of many transitional rules that Congress from time to time puts into the Revenue Code to bridge the gap between an older statutory regime and an amended regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.350" offset="551831">In 1976 Congress overhauled the estate and gift tax quite comprehensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.254" offset="575446">One thing Congress did was to effect an overall reduction of estate taxes, particularly for smaller estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.941" offset="610241">Congress also brought about a degree of integration between the gift tax and the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.847" offset="641797">For present purposes, the most relevant integrating thing Congress did was to repeal a pair of exemptions that were available under the old law... they were basically deductions... and replace them with a single unified credit under the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.141" offset="710969">Under the old law, a taxpayer during life was entitled to exempt a total of $30,000 of his property in gift form from the gift tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.733" offset="757363">That was in addition to the annual exclusion of $3,000 per donee.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.070" offset="782754">The donor was free to claim this $30,000 exemption in whole or in part, whenever he wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.926" offset="818176">At his death, his estate was then entitled to exempt $60,000 of property from the estate tax, and the ability to claim that was independent of the donor's inter vivos claim of the gift tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.401" offset="888079">In 1976 Congress abolished both of those exemptions and replaced them with a single unified credit, which was designed to replace both the gift tax $3,000 exemption and the estate tax $60,000 exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.515" offset="960491">And the new credit was to be available against either or both of these taxes as first incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.619" offset="992883">That meant that somebody could use part of the unified credit for gifts during life and what he didn't use would be available to be used against the estate tax by his executor after his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.128" offset="1047008">Congress realized that there was a problem of continuity here, because some people would have claimed the $30,000 gift tax exemption in whole or in part during life for gifts they made prior to 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.822" offset="1109702">The effective date of the new law was January 1st, 1977.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="248.376" offset="1127988">Mr. Lauber, had he waited until January 2, '77, he'd get the full... we wouldn't have a case here, would we?</text>

            <text syncTime="258.198" offset="1167276">That's right, because after the new law was enacted that abolished the old gift tax exemption, and everything was then governed by the unified credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.537" offset="1200608">So if he had made the gifts on January 2, he would have had to use up part of his unified credit or pay gift tax on the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.943" offset="1242195">So if he gave away $30,000 on January 2, he would have had to use up--</text>

            <text syncTime="287.765" offset="1285559">He would have had to use up part of his unified credit in order to avoid paying gift tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="291.869" stopTime="294.655">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="291.869" offset="1301963">He'd have had to use it all up to avoid paying the tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="294.655" stopTime="409.261">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="294.655" offset="1313039">I think not all, because the credit is dollar for dollar against the tax, whereas the old exemption you only get a number of cents on the dollar equal to your marginal rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.126" offset="1354940">Anyway, Congress saw there was a problem of continuity because if people who previously had claimed and been allowed their $30,000 gift tax exemption got the full unified credit, which was meant to be a replacement for the old exemption, they'd get the same thing twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.903" offset="1418052">So to prevent this problem Congress enacted the challenged provision, Section 210(c) of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.209" offset="1451279">And it provides that the unified credit available to a person or his estate would be reduced by an amount equal to 20 percent of the aggregate amount allowed as a specific exemption under prior law for gifts made after the day the conference committee approved the new bill and before the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.245" offset="1563397">The purpose of the provision was to prevent what this Court has called a rush to the door by people trying to hurry up and make a lot of gifts at the end of the year in the hope of double-dipping by getting both the old exemption plus a full new credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.538" offset="1624628">The reason why Congress picked 20 percent as the multiplier to work out this reduction isn't clear, but it's generally thought Congress figured that was equal to the average effective gift tax rate, and therefore... in fact, gift tax rates ranged from about three percent to 58 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.799" offset="1697666">But Congress apparently thought that the average effective rate paid by the nation's taxpayers as a whole on their gifts was about 20 percent and therefore that if you took that out of the unified credit you would be compensating for the tax benefit on average realized by most people who claimed the old exemption.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="417.934" offset="1806231">--Congress would have thought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.952" offset="1814277">They may have just picked the number out of their hats for all we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.320" offset="1831727">As the Appellees have noted, the estate and gift tax provisions were a little bit of a last minute addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.909" offset="1866104">The Senate I think hadn't incorporated a similar regime, and maybe Congress didn't flesh out what it was doing as well as it might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.951" offset="1910303">But it picked 20 percent, apparently believing that would approximate the average of tax benefit that people realized who claimed the exemption before.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.175" offset="1955129">Now, the facts of this case are that the decedent, Mr. Hirschi, made his gifts on September 28th, 1976, which was during the transitional period covered by Section 210(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="472.153" offset="2023048">He made his gifts three weeks after the conference committee approved the bill, two weeks, about, after both houses of Congress passed the bill, but one week before the exemption signed the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.946" offset="2086264">He made his gifts to five people who were all objects of his bounty, being either blood relatives or in-laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.119" offset="2118969">The amount of his gifts, $45,000, which was apparently tailored exactly to use up his full $30,000 lifetime gift tax exemption and his five annual exclusions for his five donees.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.661" offset="2177066">In other words, he gave away as much as he could without paying any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.897" offset="2193993">Two days later he filed a gift tax return, on the last day of the quarter, claiming the entire $30,000 gift tax exemption, reporting zero taxable gifts and no gift tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.890" offset="2249999">And this return, for all the records show, was accepted as filed by the Commissioner and no gift tax was ever assessed against or paid by Mr. Hirschi.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.615" offset="2300886">Mr. Hirschi died two years later, in November of '78, well after Section 210(c) was enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.922" offset="2342159">His executors claimed, who are Appellees, claimed the full unified credit against the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.828" offset="2377790">The Commissioner took the position that under Section 210(c), our transitional rule, that had to be reduced by $6,000, 20 percent of the $30,000 gift tax exemption that Mr. Hirschi had claimed during the transitional period.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.421" offset="2444141">Even so, after the reduction of the unified credit from 34 to 28,000, still the estate paid less estate tax than it would have paid had Congress never amended the tax laws in 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.576" offset="4344706">What happens is that the return is accepted as filed, and that means the deduction is allowed, because the tax is computed on the basis of the return as filed, including that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.401" offset="4392040">And the taxpayer in Virginian Hotel argued that he got to tax benefit from this claim which was allowed, and the Court held that was immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.940" offset="4542192">And what's really happened here is that the decedent probably got some not terribly good tax advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.296" offset="4571658">He probably was ill advised to claim the specific exemption, because he was in the lowest possible gift tax bracket of about three to five percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.619" offset="4608961">It would have been wise for him not to claim it at all, because the consequence was a reduction of 20 percent in his unified credit his estate would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.410" offset="4652115">But despite the fact that he may have been unwise in claiming his exemption, nevertheless he got the benefit from it, and there's no indication that he ever regretted having claimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.249" offset="4695479">The President signed the bill in October and the return is not due for the calendar quarter until November 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.771" offset="4729542">There's no showing in the record that Mr. Hirschi tried to withdraw his gift tax return or amend it to disclaim the exemption, so he apparently died content that he had gotten his exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.863" offset="4769875">Now his heirs and executors have found out that if he hadn't claimed that and died within three years of making the gifts, they're worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.619" offset="4804879">But that does not mean Mr. Hirschi did not derive the benefit from the exemption he freely claimed on that gift tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.438" offset="4836226">I guess I should say a word about the constitutional argument of the holding of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.728" offset="4865379">We think that that holding is wrong for at least four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.465" offset="4888262">First of all, as Justice Stevens and I discussed, it's hard to see how anyone was deprived of property here by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.738" offset="4925356">Mr. Hirschi was deprived of no property because he paid no gift tax at all, and his heirs wound up paying a lower estate tax than would have been true if Congress had not enacted this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.879" offset="4973944">So it's hard to see where anyone has been deprived of property in the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.464" offset="4992334">Secondly, even if one could find a deprivation of property, we don't think that this statute was retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.769" offset="5021487">That's because the statute was enacted two years before the taxable event, Mr. Hirschi's transfer of property at his death, occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.592" offset="5060775">And it is true that the law required the credit available to the estate to be computed by reference to certain events that had occurred in the past, but this Court has held that that does not, that fact, does not make a law retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.771" offset="5129529">Indeed, the estate tax has always depended in computing the tax upon events that may have occurred many, many years before the testator died, as for example in the case of gifts in contemplation of death or gifts with a retained life interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.546" offset="5188670">The mere fact that a statute effective at the date of death takes into account events occurring prior to the death of the testator does not make the statute retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.121" offset="5238930">Thirdly, even if one could construe the law as retroactive, that wouldn't make in unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.177" offset="5267142">This Court has repeatedly upheld retroactive tax statutes by looking at all the facts involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.300" offset="5303609">And the factors the Court has considered are factors like Congress' reason for making the law retroactive, the harshness of the result worked upon the taxpayer, and the degree of notice the taxpayer had of what Congress was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.125" offset="5362959">We think all three of those factors here would make it clear this law could not be unconstitutional properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.965" offset="5394306">First of all, Congress clearly had a rational purpose for making the law retroactive, if such it was, because Congress' purpose was to prevent this rush to the door by people who were trying to circumvent the effect, the purpose of the law, by taking advantage of a gap in coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.543" offset="5476644">That's clearly a rational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.594" offset="5484795">Secondly, there was no harsh result worked on the taxpayer or his heirs here, because they paid lower, a lower tax than they would have paid had the law not been enacted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.538" offset="5540592">And finally, it seems clear there was adequate notice--</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.152" offset="5623035">You certainly have the option, if you reverse the constitutional holding, to remand it to let the district court consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.288" offset="5643619">I mean, the Appellees made a very similar statutory argument below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.940" offset="5658248">The district court, for reasons it's hard to guess, didn't even mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.727" offset="5681340">So the Court certainly could remand it for the district court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.798" offset="5701611">But we think it's appropriate for the Court to avoid that need for a remand by deciding the statutory question here if they agree with us, if the Court agrees with us on the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.921" offset="5738182">The old Court of Claims decided a very similar statutory issue, so you have the benefit of that decision as well as the briefs the parties have filed, which have addressed it quite thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.579" offset="5788755">But you're not required to decide the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.282" offset="5807563">The final factor I was going to mention is the factor of notice to taxpayers, and here the conference committee action approving the bill certainly constituted notice, constructive notice to taxpayers of what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.740" offset="5865451">Indeed, the Court on many occasions has upheld retroactive laws when the retroactive activity date is back to the date of committee action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.095" offset="6102852">Several questions have been raised by the Court with respect to that benefit, and counsel has referred to the Estate of Renick case, the Court of Claims case which is offered in support of the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.088" offset="6158754">In that case, the Court of Claims held that the taxpayer in essentially similar circumstances, although the taxpayer in Renick had made the gift on December 30 of the year, that is to say after the date of enactment, as contrasted with the taxpayer in this case who made the gifts prior to the date of enactment but after the applicable committee reports had been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.274" offset="6287590">The Court of Claims held that it appeared that the taxpayer in Renick would benefit from the $30,000 exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.548" offset="6328654">In any event, the single item of legislative history turning on the passing use of the word "benefited" does not warrant departing from the unambiguous language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.853" offset="6369823">Putting it another way, the Court of Claims held that, having tentatively benefited by this gift, this claimed exemption, is tantamount or the same as having garnered that forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.065" offset="6430741">As a matter of fact, the real distinction to be drawn in this case is between the taxpayer who suffered the unfortunate consequence of having died within the three-year period preceding... succeeding the date of the gift and the one who had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.490" offset="6484448">In the case of Mr. Hirschi, having no control over only that event, which incidentally was the only event that transpired after the effective date of this legislation, his death, he was docketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.183" offset="6547142">He was not attempting to double dip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.733" offset="6553412">He was penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.885" offset="6558009">That is to say, the property that was subject to the lifetime transfer tax, the gift tax, suffering the reduction of his unified credit to the extent of 20 percent of the specific exemption allowed, i.e., $6,000, and the property was brought back into his estate for estate tax purposes and subject to tax under that system, with no corresponding restoration of the credit that had been absorbed by operation of the rule under 2010(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.497" offset="10656412">I submit to this Court that the taxpayer had to perform one other act within that period, and that's die.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.415" offset="10776158">In terms of the notice aspect which counsel has alluded to, he states in the reply briefs and in the original brief, the suggestion on page 24, and I quote, was that:</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.772" offset="10829552">"In any event, the committee reports provided him, the decedent, with constructive notice of what the effect of claiming the specific exemption was very likely to be. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.163" offset="10879080">I suggested at page 24 of our brief that, in reviewing that rule, the House report provided that there was to be a docking of 20 percent of the amount allowed as a specific exemption in computing the taxable gifts under the present law, and thus in the case where a donor had benefited from the use of the full $30,000 gift tax specific exemption under present law, the maximum unified credit allowable would be reduced by $6,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.653" offset="11021082">On page 24 of our brief, I suggest that notice, if that's the issue, the notice would have apprised the taxpayer of the consequences of this election, not just that the taxpayer was to receive a benefit of the election, but if the taxpayer made the election and then had the misfortune of dying within three years from the date of the gift that property would not only be brought back into the taxpayer's taxable base, but there would be no restoration of the credit that had been absorbed by virtue of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.976" offset="11162352">And to that end, the committee reports should have added to them, and I suggested, that even if the property which was the subject of the claimed $30,000 gift tax specific exemption is subsequently included in the donor's estate by reason of 2035, that the result would then be dictated as the Government has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.573" offset="11240719">Phrased differently, there was no actual notice, there was no constructive notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.394" offset="11264021">In fact, there was a bit of a snare for the sophisticated taxpayer with sophisticated tax advice, to the effect that if we make this beneficial election we'll have the benefit of that election forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.603" offset="11328909">In terms of the constitutional arguments, I would suggest that this case is not an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.559" offset="11364644">This case is not as estate tax case in the sense that there was reference in the amicus to this Hafner case, where that's a completely different issue, but all sorts of gifts of taxable or exempt bonds, depending upon someone's perspective, that were transferred before dates of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.922" offset="11442176">There was perhaps a rush to the door in Hafner and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.392" offset="11464014">This was not a national emergency case, as the case of Gray v. the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.880" offset="11489928">There was no double dipping in the case of this taxpayer, and the events giving rise to the transaction, the completed gifts, all occurred before the date of enactment.</text>
