            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149358">Mr. Evans, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_evans" startTime="77.750" stopTime="325.093">
            <label>Mr. William M. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="460320">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1981 the Indiana legislature passed a Reapportionment Act following the 1980 census and this Act was modified and amended in certain minor respects in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="531791">The defendants, the Democrats in this case, did not apparently, according to the record, pursue their legislative remedies any further and there's no evidence that in 1983, the 1983 General Session of the Indiana General Assembly, that they introduced any bill in the legislature to try to change the Reapportionment Act in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.160" offset="625936">So, instead of pursuing a legislative remedy before the Indiana voters, they chose to attempt a judicial remedy in the federal court and filed their lawsuit in federal court in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.170" offset="681942">This case is before the Court, and it is what appears to me to be a high visibility case, and a lot of articles in the newspaper about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="720081">I think the reason for that is because of the strange alignment of parties on both sides of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.279" offset="746413">But, I don't believe that the issues in this case are all that novel, and I believe that this Court in past opinions has in fact considered many of the issuers that are before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.837" offset="796672">So, I will start my argument with a discussion of the Whitcomb v. Chavis case decided by this Court in 1971, which I feel deals with many of the issues that the Court has in our briefs this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.164" offset="849962">In Whitcomb v. Chavis was a case that came from Indiana, involved the same state, involved the same county, Marion County, and involved the same city, of Indianapolis, and even involved on the three-judge panel a District Court Judge on that panel in 1969, who is also on the panel of this appeal today.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.327" offset="938569">In Whitcomb v. Chavis, this Court first of all carefully considered the question of racial discrimination in the electoral rules and laws in Indiana involving particularly multi-member districts in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.289" offset="1006488">And what this Court says is a matter of racial discrimination, they said there is no evidence that the multi-member districts which had existed in Indiana for many, many years were created, designed or maintained to further racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.250" offset="1078272">In making that statement, in the opinion by Justice White, be mentioned the Sims v. Baggett case as an example of what he meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.272" offset="1114426">That was a District Court case where the blacks were gaining political power under a single-member district system, and all of a sudden, for the sole reason of defeating black voting strength in that case, the issue the Court found, they went to multi-member district system.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.549" offset="1179523">And obviously, the Court said in Whitcomb v. Chavis, that is a discriminatory use of multi-member districts, and the Court struck it down in Sims v. Baggett.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.006" offset="1217348">But in the Whitcomb v. Chavis case, this Court said it found no evidence in Indiana of racial discrimination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.910" offset="1248904">The Court commented on the fact that there had been multi-member districts for many years, and there had been a mix in the House of Representatives of multi-member and single-member districts, again for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.337" offset="1298641">So, the Court considered this racial question first of all, which obviously is of great concern to this Court, to protect the rights of the minority of black citizens of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.626" offset="1343781">Then it went on and it looked at the kind of people that were raising a question, the plaintiffs in that case who were ghetto question poor in the center of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.166" offset="1381920">And, this Court in Whitcomb v. Chavis said that those voters were overwhelmingly Democrat voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.487" offset="1407206">So the Court, then, was dealing with a racial question put aside with a question of outvoted Democrats in the center of Indianapolis and what their constitutional rights were.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="325.093" stopTime="335.151">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="325.093" offset="1449629">Mr. Evans, did the court below consider the effect of this plan under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as amended?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_m_evans" startTime="335.151" stopTime="534.446">
            <label>Mr. William M. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="335.151" offset="1489962">Justice O'Connor, in this case the lower court did, and this makes this case so different from other cases because in this case the lower court said, there has been no violation by this Reapportionment Act in Indiana of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.593" offset="1551716">There has been no violation of the right of black citizens under the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.731" offset="1572196">There is absolutely nothing in this record that would justify any relief on the part of black voters, and there was some plaintiffs where the NAACF filed an action, a companion action and the Court denied their claim and they have not cross-appealed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.407" offset="1630919">So, it is fair to say, in Whitcomb v. Chavis there was no racial discrimination in Indiana, from the record, nor is there any in this case before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.077" offset="1665609">So, we have to put race to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.863" offset="1676790">And then in Whitcomb v. Chavis, decision by Justice White, he said, what constitutional rights do outvoted Democrats have as a political group in the center of Indianapolis, and he very carefully looked to the question, are they able to participate in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.074" offset="1741574">Did these ghetto poor citizens have a right to vote?</text>
            <text syncTime="401.176" offset="1754008">Did they have a right to participate in the party, their party, the Democratic party?</text>
            <text syncTime="405.144" offset="1769890">Were they hurt?</text>
            <text syncTime="405.830" offset="1772607">Were they an effective force?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.846" offset="1780653">And, the Court said, yes, they were and perhaps anticipating the Court's decision later in White v. Regester, the Court found that not to be true with blacks around Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.554" offset="1823494">But here the Court said all political processes had been met in the Whitcomb v. Chavis case and therefore these outvoted Democrats have no constitutional right to a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.696" offset="1872081">And the Court said, in Whitcomb v. Chavis again, this is true whether we're dealing with multi-member districts or single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.717" offset="1904160">In our system of government, the Court said, where you have a majority rule some people win; some people lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.705" offset="1932163">We don't have a proportional representation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.407" offset="1942925">The Court could find no need to give constitutional remedies where in any particular district, single-member or multi-member, you have a situation where one... adherents of one party lose, even if they might be in what the Court said was a safe district, and that might be true year after year after year.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.035" offset="2013456">That was the political system set forth by the Indiana Legislature and the Court found no constitutional wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.057" offset="2049505">So, the Court went on and finally said, perhaps the idea of cancelling the vote is a euphemism for political defeat at the polls, so in the Whitcomb v. Chavis case this Court was considering a claim of a political group, namely the outvoted Democrats in the city of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.352" offset="2118677">Now, in dissent... the opinion was written by Justice White and joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun, but in dissent Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall did not argue with that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.208" offset="2162145">They said that an ideological political interest group does not the constitutional protections as is true of black citizens, because they mention the fifteenth amendment and they mention the Civil War amendments which were designed to help black citizens in their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.205" offset="2238109">So, we have... these Justices, I feel, in Whitcomb v. Chavis have taken a strong stand that what the Indiana General Assembly did in 1981-'82 is not unconstitutional.</text>

Bolden case, you take a group that has been discriminated against for a long time, decades and decades, and cannot because of that past discrimination and the effect of the Civil Rights Amendment, can't have their views presented through the political process, that might give rise to a need for some sort of judicial relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.415" offset="5390984">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I should like to begin by correcting what we believe to be a few factual misapprehensions that the Court may have gained in the course of the presentation this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.156" offset="5445946">There were indeed alternative maps presented to the General Assembly, both in the session during which these laws were enacted and in subsequent sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.280" offset="5490458">However, the Court will not be startled to learn that they never saw the light of day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.851" offset="5508744">An example appears as Exhibit 48 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.136" offset="5521805">I simply want to point out that what this underlines is that there is no remedy within the legislature for the wrong of which we are complaining, and that it is and was a useless act to present to the fox a correction of the chicken coop guardian situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.698" offset="5596098">The competitive districts to which Mr. Evans referred are by his measure competitive in the sense that if an additional 15 or so percent of the statewide candidates on the Democratic ticket had run an additional ten percent ahead of the top of the Democratic ticket, it would have been possible to gain control of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.117" offset="5709782">That's what the bottom line of that "competitive" as he uses it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.640" offset="5747817">Mr. Evans' statistics are done manually, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.275" offset="5758370">What he did is, took the top of the Democratic statewide ticket and created a chart that was not an exhibit in the case, was not introduced in evidence, and is a summary, though, of data that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.198" offset="5802047">It is, we submit, a manipulation of the data but even on that manipulated data it demonstrates that the high-waters mark for the Democrats doesn't do the job on this map, and that even if the Democrats have a substantial majority of the votes they cannot gain a majority of the seats under foreseeable election returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.794" offset="5880519">Finally, on the comment about multi-member districts, it is correct in one sense that Indiana has historically had multi-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.400" offset="5918867">However, from the Constitution of 1851 forward through the districts involved in Whitcomb against Chavis with which this Court dealt, those multi-member districts were counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.477" offset="5971216">The legislature was apportioned among the counties, which is the basic unit of government in Indiana, and by 1971 fifteen, for example, were apportioned to Marion County which is the City of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.236" offset="6030253">That scheme is not what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.521" offset="6043418">Those were multi-member districts, but there was no showing and there was no contention, and it was not true that those multi-member districts were done for invidious discriminatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.746" offset="6088245">They simply were an effort to allocate representation among the counties and they respected the historical practice of attempting to give counties representation within the state government, a perfectly legitimate objective of state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.387" offset="6142893">The multi-member districts that we are attacking here today bear no relationship to anything other than the objective of maximizing the preservation of the transient majority's control of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.646" offset="6195869">They are fundamentally, qualitatively different types of districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.756" offset="6260339">The whole theory of permitting greater deviations from perfect populations stemming from the early cases, Mahan versus Howell if that is how you pronounce it, in '64 and forward in Virginia allows the greater population deviations because the state may properly conclude that it wishes to recognize, for example, cities, towns, counties, other legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.973" offset="6361172">Here they took the population deviation but didn't carry with it the burden of honoring all these other proper objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.341" offset="7318716">Now, the effect of that scheme, of course, was not to discriminate against one party or another, because whichever party then carried Marion County carried all 15 seats and had reasonable access to the control of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.749" offset="7364274">Here they took the very same body politic, Marion County which previously had 15 seats under the '70 census, discovered that it had only 14... and by the way, coincidentally, a perfect 14... it could have been carved up into 14 single member districts perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.361" offset="7430729">But, in order to preserve its 15 seats in the Legislature they took Marion County, patched on areas from three continguous counties, to create five three-member districts out of an area that is essentially 47-53 Republican.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.287" offset="7494468">Now, having done that, they took the hole of that doughnut and gave it three seats.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.463" offset="12763157">There is no alternate plan that follows these guidelines, and particularly the guideline of black voters, because... and that is a constitutional requirement which was met by the Indiana Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.388" offset="12814880">When my colleague mentioned the guidelines to the Court today, he didn't mention anything about not diluting the black vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.461" offset="12847167">He mentioned crossing county lines, and if you read his brief you wouldn't know that there are two parties in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.615" offset="12871722">When he uses the term "minority", he means Democrats in his brief, but the legislature is faced with a real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.269" offset="12898367">We must deal with black voters fairly, and within that context we developed a plan, and no plan has ever been presented to show any different alternative plan with the same guidelines would produce a different and more beneficial--</text>
