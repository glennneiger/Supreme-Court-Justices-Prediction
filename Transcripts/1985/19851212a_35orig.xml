            <text syncTime="11.465" offset="186561">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.854" offset="208190">This case is an action to quiet title brought by the United States of America against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.758" offset="243821">The area in controversy is a body of coastal water off the coast of Massachusetts known as Nantucket Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.536" offset="274854">The charts appended to both the Massachusetts brief in support of its exception and the United States reply brief, both those charts indicate the configuration and location of Nantucket Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.639" offset="331279">They further indicate the precise nature of the controversy on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.246" offset="357715">Massachusetts claims that the entirety of Nantucket Sound is state, and therefore United States inland waters and that Massachusetts is the owner of the seabed thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.411" offset="426365">The United States, as the chart appended to its brief shows, it claims a small, what one can call a small federal enclave in the center of the Sound with a narrow passageway leading thereto from the open ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.076" offset="489058">This case at its present state of the proceeding involves only Nantucket Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.354" offset="526152">Other areas in controversy have so far been disposed of, and the present stage of the proceedings are before the Court on the report of its Special Master and on the sole exception taken by Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.411" offset="574427">This exception by Massachusetts is somewhat unusual for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.549" offset="598982">First, this is not the type of submerged land or marine boundary case as the Court has heard many in the past, where the state and the federal government are fighting for a small area of land because of the king's ransom in oil royalties that they portend.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.513" offset="666796">Under Massachusetts state law, which has been in existence for a long time, Nantucket Sound is designated a state ocean sanctuary and Massachusetts wishes to preserve its state protection which is absolutely--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.684" offset="823530">There can be no change in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.011" offset="828755">There can be no degradation of the seabed, no erection of structures, no waste disposal.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="201.375" offset="946201">And I don't know that this Court has ever recognized ancient title as a theory of recovery as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.027" offset="984863">It has had cases dealing with historic title, and I'm not sure that I understand what you think the elements are for establishment of ancient title, and whether you think there are any cases from this Court that would support the application of that theory as opposed to normal principles of historic title.</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_herrmann" startTime="240.811" stopTime="394.984">
            <label>Mr. Henry Herrmann</label>
            <text syncTime="240.811" offset="1103981">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.982" offset="1112654">I think there are two parts to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.185" offset="1117460">Let me take the second one first.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.871" offset="1124252">I think there is indeed solid precedent from the decisions of this Court... if I may refer the Court to Manchester versus Massachusetts, decided in 1981, there the Court had before it a controversy as to the status of Buzzards Bay, which if I can again... if I may refer the Court to the charts appended to either of the briefs, you will see that Buzzards Bay is one of the semi-contiguous bodies of water to Nantucket Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.641" offset="1239295">First you have Nantucket Sound, and eastward of that you have Vineyard Sound and then eastward of that you have Buzzards Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.905" offset="1260402">Well, as to the famous... and it is a famous case, it's been discussed by almost all the international publicists at length, as to the Buzzards Bay case in 1981... interestingly enough, this Court said very succinctly, without equivocation, "It is clear", said the Court,</text>
            <text syncTime="296.461" offset="1326544">"that Massachusetts is the owner, that it has Buzzards Bay by virtue of its province charter. "</text>
            <text syncTime="304.083" offset="1357055">Now, I ask the Court for a moment to ponder the implications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.128" offset="1377222">How could that be anything but what we today under modern international law parlance, as it has been, for example, been expressed by the U.N. study, the juridical water study, in paragraph 71 thereof which we quote, what else could that mean but an ancient title?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.292" offset="1445872">To support that finding and that holding by the Court, the King of England had to have gained it in the first place, if Massachusetts got it from the Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.368" offset="1478263">How could the King of England have gained it?</text>
            <text syncTime="336.304" offset="1485996">He could only under then prevailing international law have gained Buzzards Bay and the surrounding lands by initial discovery which was at that time, as was also held by this Court in Martin versus Waddell, the accepted way of gaining title over newly discovered land, to just discover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.127" offset="1549212">The title was then fortified by occupation, through the settlements in the colonial times.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.842" offset="1572095">Then, that is how title vested in the Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.152" offset="1585365">The Crown then passed the title, as it had the right to do under British law, and that's unquestioned today as it was then.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.774" offset="1623818">The Crown gave title to these lands and these subsoils in Buzzards Bay as it has, we claim, in Nantucket Sound, to its colony, to the Province of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.036" offset="1664882">That is the 1691 charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.380" offset="1674286">That's the one referred to 100 years ago by this Court, and that's precisely the charter that the Special Master in this case said was operative in granting us Nantucket Sound.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="394.984" offset="1720680">Mr. Herrmann, do you think that title acquired in that fashion can be abandoned by the states?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_herrmann" startTime="403.448" stopTime="468.329">
            <label>Mr. Henry Herrmann</label>
            <text syncTime="403.448" offset="1754534">Theoretically, yes, Your Honor, but our position is, we have briefed that, and I would like to point out again, while in theory it could be abandoned, in practice prevailing international law imposes extremely strict provisions, how that must occur, and if those provisions are not met the theory of lapse or abandonment of an already perfected title, and may I just address that distinction, what the Master was talking about and what I think Your Honor is talking about is, once a title is perfected can it be abandoned or can it lapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.311" offset="1882012">What the Master was talking about later in the discussion, and what the Government is focusing on is... was a so-called historic title ever acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.403" offset="1914404">But as to the perfected ancient title which was now perfected in colonial times, no I would say in theory yes, but it is quite clear that international law, both by the courts and the publicists, this so-called active abandonment theory is definitely in disfavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.160" offset="1993398">It's in disfavor because it leads to instability of international titles and possible international tensions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="468.329" stopTime="494.835">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="468.329" offset="2014087">Well, there's no problem here, because if the state doesn't have it the United States does.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.030" offset="2040836">There's no lapse in title, and if abandonment is possible I must say it's hard for me to understand why the legislative acts of disclaimer by Massachusetts and the publication of its official charts don't reflect abandonment by the State of Massachusetts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_herrmann" startTime="494.835" stopTime="887.503">
            <label>Mr. Henry Herrmann</label>
            <text syncTime="494.835" offset="2120040">Your Honor, I don't think... I submit that they do not reflect abandonment by Massachusetts for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.425" offset="2146476">If Your Honor's referring to the late 19th Century charts that were published by the harbor and land commissioners, those were published upon the mandate of the Massachusetts Legislature, leading back to an 1859 statute by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.763" offset="2203841">Just like the British Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, both those statutes were passed as an almost emergency measure to cure the problem that apparently there was no criminal jurisdiction in the open water, on the seacoast.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.571" offset="2255041">The problem was quickly... very quickly, because of two cases that involved the inability to prosecute a criminal, so the Legislature almost on an emergency basis extended its jurisdiction seaward.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.471" offset="2302583">So, the first thing is they had no intent, and Mahler versus Transportation which we cite in our brief deals with that problem so there should be no inference that a state... a legislature is abandoning a state seabed unless they expressly say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.827" offset="2352007">The purpose of that legislation was not to abandon territory already vested in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.761" offset="2371756">Its purpose was purely one to extend on an emergency basis, curial jurisdiction for criminal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.150" offset="2393385">That's point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.962" offset="2396624">Point two is that if you look, as I think one must, at the state statute and the large-scale charts of 1891... I'm sorry, 1883, you look at them together because they are a unitary manifestation.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.394" offset="2450332">As we pointed out in our brief, the charts are ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.298" offset="2465901">They do not show an intent to abandon Nantucket Sound with... not specificity as is required under international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.015" offset="2492755">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.234" offset="2493695">Because if Nantucket Sound had been high seas, as the Government contends, there would have had to have been a closing line between Vineyard Sound, clearly, and Nantucket Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.417" offset="2534446">That is Exhibit 4 of Massachusetts exhibits, Your Honor, as we have referred to it in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.024" offset="2556807">It is clear that the Harbor and Land Commissioners had a great deal of problem reconciling that criminal jurisdiction statute and what they perceived to be the actual status of Nantucket Sound, which was not high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.740" offset="2599752">Finally, Your Honor, I would ask you to consider the following point.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.317" offset="2609992">I submit that it is constitutionally impermissible for a state to diminish the national domain, once... and this is what the Special Master really found... if there was a perfected ancient title, that was then state seabed but it was also a part of the national domain, and I do not think that any state legislature under our constitutional system has the right to disclaim territory that belongs to the nation as a whole, as well as to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.852" offset="2732141">So, for those three reasons, A, it wasn't the legislative intent to abandon anything; B, they did not do so effectively, look at the charts that went with the statute; and C, I don't think they have the constitutional power to.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.628" offset="2771220">But to return again, Your Honor, to the first part of your question, what is required under international law?</text>
            <text syncTime="664.078" offset="2797029">In the first place it would have been, I suggest to you, an international problem because at the time the United States says that there was a lapse, that is in the last century, and this is an interesting historical point, your only time the United States acquired title to that seabed, the first time, incidentally, was in 1949 during the Truman proclamation which extended the United States' assertion of imperium and dominion from the three-mile limit out to the edge of the continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.299" offset="2921894">At the time in question, in the late 1890's, it would have been... the option was clearly, either inland waters and ergo, state seabed, or, not belonging to the United States at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.045" offset="2968915">So, this blending, as it were, which Your Honor has referred to is only a late postwar manifestation.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.621" offset="2987201">The elements, quickly stated in bare outline, because there has been much written about it by the publicists, in international law to have abandonment which is not favored, you have to look to the exact circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.474" offset="3054596">First, the question of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.177" offset="3061493">As long as there is not an adverse claimant and the United States has not proven... has not even suggested that since colonial times any other foreign nation or group of foreign nations has ever even hinted at a claim to Nantucket Sound, absent an adverse claimant, the World Court, the International Court of Justice has in two leading cases indicated that it would not deem significant even a 200-year period of absolute cessation of activity, which of course there is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.882" offset="3184268">There were always exploitation activities and assertions of dominion.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.866" offset="3204226">But even assuming for the moment for the sake of the argument that from colonial times, let's say from the time of the Revolution, there had been a total cessation of assertion over Nantucket Sound, the World Court in the two cases we cited, the case of the Minkes and Ekrahoes Islands in the Channel, the British Channel, and in the case, the so-called Eastern Greenland case, in both those cases a time period of over 200 years was deemed as not significant for one reason only, the absence of an adverse claimant which is also absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.977" offset="3328673">Secondly, it seems well settled in the international law, according to the pre-eminent experts whose views we cite in our brief, that you have to consider two more circumstances if abandonment is to be argued about.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.364" offset="3378201">One is the geographical situation on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.706" offset="3387605">It seems well settled that if the so-called abandoned territory is in direct geographic proximity, if it's integrated into the territory or very much adjacent to it, of the so-called abandoning state, that counts heavily against such a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.683" offset="3455524">And most important, if the so-called abandoning nation at all times during the time period involved retains the power to assert its control and jurisdiction over that area, if it wishes... I'm not talking about actual assertion but if it has the de facto power to reach out, as it were, at any point in time and assert its jurisdiction over that area, then it seems settled in international law that you can have no presumption of abandonment from mere inactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.266" offset="3573806">You must then find an actual overt express act of renunciation which, I submit to you, is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.105" offset="3609124">The only argument the United States has is that late 19th century legislation by Massachusetts, and I've already pointed out that was neither the legislative intent nor did the Legislature even presume such an attempt to accomplish the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.459" offset="3654577">I return now to the sole question which remains now, I submit, before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.421" offset="3742453">No, Your Honor, I haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.953" offset="3748513">I'm glad you reminded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.062" offset="3753006">The elements of ancient title really are in direct... somewhat direct contrast to historic title, so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.245" offset="3793757">Both of them, and this terminology gets a little confusing if one uses it quickly, both U.N. study, grounds for finding historic waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.910" offset="3856347">So, the antecedent of "historic waters" may be either ancient or historic.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.394" offset="3870348">The terminology is not optimal but I think we are stuck with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.969" offset="3884663">Now, in case of historic title, that is really, as the Master explained at length, a matter of prescriptive title.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.840" offset="3928131">You attain such a historic title prescriptively, as against the community of nations, by fulfilling certain prerequisites, and very briefly stated they are as expressed again in the U.S. study, the juridical regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.586" offset="3975047">They are, one, you have to have a claim by the state, by the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.678" offset="3991452">Secondly, there has to be continuity for that claim, and again I stress that's what the Master is talking about, continuity of a claim, not continuity of an already ripened title.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.050" offset="4032934">And third, you have to gauge the so-called reaction of other sovereign states and some scholars say you have to have an actual lack of protest, you have to have acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.045" offset="4076925">Others say the mere absence of protest is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.371" offset="4090195">Those are the elements of historic title.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.480" offset="4098658">Ancient title is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.198" offset="4105555">Ancient title is not attained by prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.462" offset="4118616">It is really a perfected original title.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.524" offset="4130841">It must under prevailing law, and this seems clear, be acquired prior to the regime of freedom of the seas, because since freedom of the seas became an accepted doctrine in international law, certainly no earlier than the 18th century and some experts say as late as the early 19th century, prior to... since freedom of the seas became a doctrine of international law you cannot acquire ancient title to seabed non-prescriptively because you would have to be acquiring it against the interest of the community of nations, against the res communas which is the open seabeds, the open ocean seabed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.851" offset="4284128">However, prior to the coming into force of the freedom of the seas doctrine, which I think we have demonstrated is the case here and which the Master found in our favor, prior to that doctrine coming to force you could acquire... and this is why it's important not to get overly involved in the term 18th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.074" offset="4401052">In ancient title you acquire an original title, not by prescription but by fulfilling certain acts which were required under then prevailing international domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.508" offset="4442743">Those acts were discovery of new territory, of res nullius, of terra nova, discovery followed by effective occupation to fortify the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.864" offset="4480151">The Master his quite explicitly found in our favor on both those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.033" offset="4500840">That, Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor, if as we see the elements, the central elements of distinction between these two types of title, both of which can individually without the other being present lead to a finding of historic waters which would vest inland status in a particular body of water.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1110.197" offset="4581506">Let me clarify one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.805" offset="4595925">What do you mean by "occupation", that element of the claim, when you're talking about this area of water that we're talking about here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_herrmann" startTime="1120.381" stopTime="1306.757">
            <label>Mr. Henry Herrmann</label>
            <text syncTime="1120.381" offset="4622257">Under prevailing international law, and by that I wish to point out to the Court, we do have a problem of so-called intertemporal law in this international law related case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.376" offset="4666247">Intertemporal law, and that's a well settled doctrine by now, means you must apply of necessity the international law rules prevailing at the point in time when you're looking at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.154" offset="4705326">You do not apply modern international law retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.246" offset="4717761">If you are looking at a claim of acquired ancient title, say in the 17th century, you must look to it under standards then prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.883" offset="4748272">Under standards then prevailing, Your Honor, occupation could have been satisfied for a marine area of this sort by effective settlement of the surrounding land masses, that's point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.160" offset="4801352">That certainly occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.549" offset="4806890">Indeed, we have evidence on the record that the British explorer Gosenoll sailed into the Sound and immediately erected a fort at the entrance to Vineyard Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.545" offset="4838969">The second element, and it's a very important one, is exclusive and extensive exploitation of the resources of such a body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.651" offset="4883377">The Master, of course, based on voluminous evidence by Massachusetts, made findings that there was... and I think these were almost his express words... he said that there had been such extensive and exclusive exploitation of the resources of Nantucket Sound by the British settlers to be equal to a formal assertion of jurisdiction over those waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.454" offset="4974596">That was his finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.204" offset="4977522">That would be the second element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.156" offset="4985359">I would point out further, Justice Stevens, that if there is one thing settled in international law and the Government has conceded this in its brief, one undisputed way of gaining ancient title for seabed is through sedentary fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.057" offset="5036977">There are several well-known examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.009" offset="5044814">One was cited by the Government, the so-called Caylon pearl fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.976" offset="5060696">There are also the fisheries in the Arabian Gulf, the pearl fisheries off Sicily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.208" offset="5085565">There is the famous case of the Tunisian sponge fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.175" offset="5097476">This is one thing that's beyond question by now, that you can obtain ancient title by that means and certainly if the Master found anything at all, he found that the exploitation over the sedentary fisheries in the Sound were continuous, that they were exclusive, and that they were vital, just like in the Norwegian Fisheries case which was cited, that they were a vital element for the survival of that continuous community as our expert witness called it, a marine resource region.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.430" offset="5206459">And, that is how one could, and indeed in this case did acquire ancient title by occupation over seabed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.725" offset="5235612">Finally, I would add that what you also have to look to is the domestic law at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.316" offset="5257973">We have pointed out, and we return now to the evidentiary issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.315" offset="5269989">The Master said quite correctly, we could not have claimed any area as ancient title unless it conformed to the then prevailing domestic British law which delineated between inland waters and open sea based upon the fauces terra doctrine, which meant, can you see from headland to headland across the entrance to any body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.619" offset="5351178">If you could, the water therein was inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.133" offset="5361313">If you couldn't, it was open sea.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.757" offset="5367792">This was a requirement for ancient title as well as for other kinds of title?</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.928" offset="5384405">It is under these circumstances, Your Honor, as the Master, I think, correctly found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.333" offset="5402064">If we are claiming ancient title in a given century and we claim it originated in colonial times, then you must of course look, as I said, to international law and the domestic law at that time and see what would the then prevailing sovereign without dispute have looked to, to international law and his own domestic law, whether he can claim the waters or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.762" offset="5483775">The prevailing law of England at that time was that you could only claim it as inland waters if the eyesight test prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.680" offset="5511465">Of course in a later case you could theoretically, although we're not claiming that here now, to answer your question, you could claim historic title after freedom of the seas came into force, and say, we base it on the same theory, it is encloseable, but we are not doing that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.129" offset="5565277">That would be a claim of historic title ripening after the freedom of the seas came into force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.626" offset="5587220">We did claim that before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.718" offset="5595579">We are no longer pressing that particular claim at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.623" offset="5607282">We would turn, in connection therewith, to the crucial remaining issue before this Court, what is the proper standard of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.307" offset="5641973">The Master was satisfied that Massachusetts to his satisfaction had shown all the elements of ancient title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.962" offset="5672588">The only reason he could not recommend a decree in our favor was that at one point only he felt himself constrained by what he thought the implications of prior decisions of this Court were as to, quote, "clear beyond doubt evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.923" offset="5736432">We said that he felt, if it was a case of first impression, he felt that was not an appropriate standard for proceedings of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.577" offset="5763076">Here you have the situation, Your Honors, where an experienced federal trial judge found after a lengthy trial that he was satisfied that in colonial times you could indeed see across the eastern entrance of Nantucket Sound, which is all the case boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.569" offset="5835070">He felt that by what he considered the implications of two prior cases, the second California case and the second Louisiana case, he felt that he could not on that ground, because that one element was not, quote, "totally clear beyond doubt", although he was satisfied, he could not recommend a finding in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.109" offset="5909153">The United States has tried to divert a discussion of that, what we think is the only remaining issue, by getting into this lapse question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.996" offset="5936738">Well, the Master never found lapse as to any perfected ancient title, nor... it's not easy to see why he should have because the matter wasn't raised before him nor was it briefed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.008" offset="5972787">All that was discussed by the Master was whether an historic title had ripened, whether acquisition of an historic title had later ripened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.349" offset="6006120">Nobody argued or briefed to the Master the question, did an already perfected Colonial, ancient title once acquired, lapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.517" offset="6042796">In other words, the issue is retention vis-a-vis acquisition and the United States, it seems to me, commingles this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.266" offset="6065783">They say you don't have to reach the evidentiary issue, and I submit that that is what should be reached because that's the only remaining element in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.713" offset="6107579">The United States... let me just finish up on the evidentiary issue by saying that we've come a long way since the briefing began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.305" offset="6133911">If the Court will look at page 25 of the Government's reply brief, there they have expressly conceded that such a high... so-called higher standard of evidence need only be imposed where the Government has disclaimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.190" offset="6193470">They have now given up their previous argument that it is of necessity because of the requirements of international law and domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.782" offset="6215831">So, what the Government is really saying, and I ask the Court to ponder the implications, they can come into a case even with a disclaimer which the Court would otherwise hold to be non-dispositive because it is filed on the eve of or during litigation, and they're really saying in effect, they can come into court, push a button, and by pushing a button impose a higher standard of proof on the claiming state, even though it is a disclaimer made during litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.145" offset="6317290">I cannot... I do not think that can be reconciled with the previous decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.610" offset="6363161">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.686" offset="6375491">If I may turn from legal theory to the geographical and historical facts appurtenant to Nantucket Sound for a moment, it may be helpful to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.978" offset="6424706">I invite the Court first to look at the chart which is appended to the Massachusetts exception, simply to have a visual picture of the area we're talking about in a more precise way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.378" offset="6486250">It seems to us that when you look at that map and you look at Nantucket Island, what you see is an island in the sea, not a bay, not an extra mouth to an inlet, but an island around which there is a strait.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.790" offset="6591890">There's a strait from the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sound between Vineyard and Nantucket Sound, and there's another strait which is indeed well marked navigation channel going from the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sound through the Sound and out Vineyard Sound, a deep, marked navigation channel from one open sea to another open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.451" offset="6698574">Now, I suggest that that configuration has never been found to constitute inland water by ancient title, by historic title, by juridic title, at any time except only during the exaggerated period of the Stuarts which everyone agrees cannot be relied on in this or any other case, because repudiated by England itself long before the American revolution, or alternatively, in modern times under the straight base line system used in the Norwegian case and condoned by the International Convention under Article 4, but a procedure, a method which the United States has at all times declined to follow and which this Court has determined is a matter for the Government of the United States to determine and not for the Court to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.911" offset="6944438">This configuration is wholly unlike all examples that are mentioned in the briefs and in the report in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.361" offset="6982159">It is not like Delaware Bay or Chesapeake Bay or Boston Harbor or Buzzards Bay or Long Island Sound, all of which are clear, deep indentations into the mainland, nor is it like Mississippi Sound And Chandelier Sound which this Court has characterized as cul-de-sacs, dead ends, not a straight in and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.788" offset="7083932">Despite the fact that this case has been proceeding at its usual slow pace for many years, despite the fact that this question of whether a configuration of this kind can qualify as inland, Massachusetts has to this day never suggested that English law or American law has at any time characterized such a like body of water elsewhere as inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.525" offset="7206812">That seems to us a rather telling failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.789" offset="7227919">Now, turning from geography to history, we are told that the Sound was discovered in 1602 and yet from that day until 1971 there was not any specific claim to this Sound by anyone in the government in those three and a half and more centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.483" offset="7330632">No agency of government, legislative, executive or judicial, whether of the Crown of England, the Colony of Massachusetts, the independent Commonwealth, the State of the Union or the United States in all that time mentions or claims the interior center of Nantucket Sound as inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.410" offset="7422374">The only suggestion that there might be such a claim is with respect to a 1932 statute which prohibits trolling within the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.889" offset="7484337">We do not read that statute as claiming jurisdiction over the center of the Sound because it refers to a three-mile belt in on of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.821" offset="7524043">It seems to us, quite logically to me, we're claiming jurisdiction over so much of the Sound as is within three miles of any shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.895" offset="7560301">But at all events, even if we misread the statute, this Court has squarely held in the Alaska case reported in Volume 422 of the United States reports, that a claim to fishery regulation is not sufficient to establish an accession of sovereignty as inland water, and therefore fishery regulation would not suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.965" offset="7656641">Now, in the hundreds of documents introduced in this case, spanning more than three centuries, we don't have a single one that reflects an expressed accession of of jurisdiction as inland water over the center of the Sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.519" offset="7878786">Yes, in that we recognize that there can indeed be a perfected legal title obtained at a time when the law was different, which may survive as a historic waters claim through the intervening change of law, provided that first the establishment of that old title is clear and secondly that it was continually asserted rather than clearly abandoned, as was the case here, in the intervening time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.367" offset="8006159">And, if that is what is meant by ancient title, we have no quarrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.848" offset="8024131">To the extent that Massachusetts asserts that there is some doctrine which requires less occupation, less accession of sovereignty, and which is almost never found to have lapsed or been abandoned despite very clear, unequivocal statements of repudiation, we deny that such a doctrine exists and secondly that it has ever been recognized by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.810" offset="8415968">Justice O'Connor, if one assumes, contrary to our argument that there ever was a perfected claim or perfected ancient title, and that that title survived until... or through the period when the United States became a sovereign nation, then what Your Honor suggests could indeed be the result, but it was open to the United States to reclaim that area as it did with respect to the resources of the seabed in the Truman Proclamation of 1945, and as it has with respect to fisheries in other legislation, and as it could with respect to all jurisdiction by adopting a different limit than the three-mile limit as it is free to do, or by using a straight base line method which as a matter of international law it is free to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.881" offset="8640307">So, there is no difficulty in the fact that the disclaimer by Massachusetts might have, for a period, subject to the United States' ability to repair it, momentarily the boundaries of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.514" offset="14290802">But as to ancient title, I think this Court has several times indicated it would look with considerable caution, considerable suspicion, at an attempt to retrench the territory of states already vested.</text>
