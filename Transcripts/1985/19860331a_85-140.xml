            <text syncTime="285.571" offset="1279256">In Moore versus City of East Cleveland, Justice Powell noted the difficulty this Court has sometimes had in defining fundamental rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and suggested, based upon numerous cases of this Court, that appropriate limits and guidelines for determining whether or not rights are truly fundamental can be found in the tradition, history, and heritage of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.246" offset="1433901">In that particular case, Justice Powell, writing for the plurality, concluded that the Constitution protects the family simply because the family is so rooted in the history and traditions of our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.554" offset="1487087">Many of this Court's decisions have followed the history and traditions of our nation in making its determination as to whether or not a particular activity is entitled to constitutional protection as a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.267" offset="1562006">Thus far this Court has concluded that the right of privacy includes matters which involve marriage and family, procreation, abortion, child rearing and child education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.228" offset="6113790">So, imagine for a moment an ordinance or a statute that says unmarried couples may hold hands and they may perhaps embrace lightly, but extended caresses or kissing with the mouth is forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.099" offset="6173350">Now, in their theory, even if this occurs in the home, under their theory as long as the state says the majority of our legislators disapprove of this conduct and, indeed, there is a long history of disapproving things that might lead to greater intimacies among unmarried people, we can outlaw it, not just outlaw it, but we can resist a request for more particularized explanation of why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.055" offset="6273137">When Justice Stevens asked, what is the public interest after all, why is it to so great, you don't even want to prosecute him in this clear case of violation, I think you will notice that Mr. Hobbs retreated to generalities.</text>

Ullman, I think what you recognized in that case and what I would stress here is that when a state's assertion of power over liberty occurs at the intersection of intimate personal association, which this Court has recognized in a half-century of cases, and the privacy of the home in the clearest possible sense, then there must be at least heightened scrutiny rather than the unquestioning deference that the State of Georgia would request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.078" offset="10637258">It seems to us that it is easier using that process to conclude that this case implicates a fundamental right and even to conclude it in Moore v. East Cleveland, because as the tradition of family is... In your dissenting opinion in Moore, I think it was an important point that it was not necessarily so crucial a matter for the society to ensure the right of grandmothers to choose exactly which grandchildren to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.654" offset="10743524">Now, I think myself the majority was right in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.106" offset="10753346">But, whatever you think about Moore, the long line of opinions cannot in any principled way be cut off at the particular triangle of rights in which the State of Georgia would try to encase this Court's precedents, marriage, family, and procreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.097" offset="10817294">If the entire line of decisions is not to be repudiated root and branch, it has to stand for some generalizable principle of the kind that the majority opinion in the Jaycees case endorsed where the Court expressly rejected the idea of a methodology that would proceed by specific categories unmentioned in the Constitution like marriage and family and in favor of the more functional approach that would look to the distinctively personal aspects of life that are being regulated in settings distinguished, as the Court put it, by solace, selectivity and seclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.993" offset="10972879">Now, if liberty means anything in our Constitution, especially given the Ninth Amendment's proposition that it is not all expressly enumerated, if liberty means anything it means that the power of government is limited in a way that requires an articulated rationale by government for an intrusion on freedom as personal as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.098" offset="11065353">It is not a characteristic of governments devoted to liberty that they proclaim the unquestioned authority of big brother dictate every detail of intimate life in the home.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.891" offset="11148527">What sense does it make to use the apparatus of the Fourth Amendment with the controversial exclusionary rule to protect the privacy of the home if the Constitution is insensitive to the substantive privacies of the life within the home?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.012" offset="11208922">It seems to us that if the protections of the Third and Fourth Amendments are not to be reduced to error and empty formalisms, that they have to reflect an underlying principle, a principle not unlike that which this Court recognized in decisions like Meyer and Pierce and more recently in Moore v. East Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.465" offset="11298783">Those underlying principles, I think it is important to stress, do not place on a constitutional pedestal as though receiving this Court's particular approval, the particular acts involved in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.046" offset="11361059">I think in that sense it is misleading to say that we are championing a fundamental right to commit a particular sexual act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.731" offset="11387808">We are saying that there is a fundamental right to restrict government's intimate regulation of the privacies of association like in the home.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.170" offset="11689575">When the government would tell people in this much detail how to conduct their intimate lives and doesn't apparently have a good enough reason to keep Mr. Hardwich in something other than a limbo in which he could be prosecuted any time until August under this extraordinarily sweeping law, when it does that, it seems to us that it is fully respectful of history and tradition for the Eleventh Circuit to have said you owe Mr. Hardwick a better reason and you owe the people of the United States a better reason than simply unquestioned deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.070" offset="12617235">As to the first, if the State of Georgia were simply defending... Might I finish the answer to this question, Mr. Chief Justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.367" offset="12650358">If the State of Georgia were defending its refusal to sanction homosexual marriage, there would be a close connection between that and the first rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.640" offset="12679511">The connection, however, would be so weak between this sweeping law and the rationale of endorsing or helping marriage that I doubt that would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.446" offset="12710754">As to avoiding the spread of communicable diseases, the American Public Health Association, at page 27 of the amicus brief, they think that this law and laws like it would be counter-productive to that end, but you don't even reach that issue until you have some kind of meaningful inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.786" offset="12768118">Surely, if a narrowly tailored law could be shown necessary to protect the public health, that would be a compelling justification, but Georgia offers no such justification here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.232" offset="12809810">Limited government, we think, makes the Eleventh Circuit's decision correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.997" offset="12836873">The State of Georgia is not acting as big brother in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.184" offset="12881699">It is adhering to centuries-old tradition and the conventional morality of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.760" offset="12915972">Certainly, it cannot invade the privacy of the home and regulate each intimate activity which takes place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.027" offset="12965082">Each statute enacted by any state must be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and it is submitted most respectfully to Mr. Tribe that this statute is related to the legitimate purpose of maintaining a decent and moral society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.560" offset="13043136">It is inherently intertwined with the state's concern with the moral soundness of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.986" offset="13072915">Just a couple of comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.539" offset="13087126">The State of Georgia in its official code does have a general severability statute and that should bear on the issue here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.684" offset="13135609">In summary, the liberty that exists under our Constitution is not unrestrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.907" offset="13200602">It is ordered liberty, it is not licentiousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.890" offset="13224530">If the Eleventh Circuit's decision is affirmed in this case, the State of Georgia and other states will be impeded for making those distinctions between true liberty ordered liberty, and licentiousness.</text>
