            <label>Mr. Marvin L. White, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="99.664" offset="546247">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are here today seeking a clarification of the Court's holding in Enmund versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.554" offset="589819">This needed clarification comes about from what we contend to be an erroneous interpretation placed on Inman by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.362" offset="632973">Further, there has developed in this area a split among the circuits as to how, when, and by whom these Enmund criteria findings are to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.135" offset="676127">The Fifth Circuit has held in several cases, this being one of them, that there must be some talismanic jury finding of the factors while the Eleventh Circuit holds that Enmund is a question of proportionality and can be found from the record by an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.381" offset="757107">The basic procedural background of this particular case is that Mr. Bullock was convicted by the Circuit Court of Hines County in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.206" offset="804441">The conviction and sentence was affirmed in August of 1980 by the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.010" offset="831608">And then this Court denied cert in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.914" offset="851252">In this interim there after Enmund was decided in 1982, the District Court entered an opinion in this case on the habeas denying the write of habeas corpus in June of 1983, and then the Fifth Circuit reversed this Court, the District Court, in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.660" offset="938188">The facts, of course, that give rise to this case are that on the night of September the 21st, 1978, the petitioner and a fellow named Rickie Tucker and some other friends went to a night spot in Jackson and at the end of the evening, when the place closed, they were found, Bullock and his friend were found without a ride, and their friends had left them there, and Mark Dickson offered them a ride home.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.613" offset="1062008">On the way there, there developed some altercation after stopping to buy a loaf of bread and finding none there.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.369" offset="1093042">Bullock borrowed money from Mark Dickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.737" offset="1106521">There developed an altercation over some drugs or some payment for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.491" offset="1133479">It is not really clear in the record what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.510" offset="1145600">Dickson says, I don't have any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.495" offset="1153541">You can take my car as payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.664" offset="1166185">They got back in the car after this, and drove a little further on.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.901" offset="1187187">Dickson stopped the car and began to fight with Rickie Tucker, who was in the back seat of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.924" offset="1219265">Tucker ordered or told Bullock to grab hold of Dickson, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.542" offset="1237760">Dickson broke away, got out of the car, ran down the road, then, pursued by Tucker this whole time.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.397" offset="1265136">Dickson... I mean, Bullock had a cast on his leg, and he followed these people down the road, these two, and joined in the fray again, grabbing Bullock by the hair... I mean Dickson by the hair of the head, and was hit himself by Tucker wielding a whiskey bottle as he hit Mr. Dickson on the head, cutting his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.228" offset="1356460">The evidence shows that Mr. Dickson was killed by having his skull crushed by concrete blocks, and then Bullock and Dickson disposed of the body that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.071" offset="1415811">Tucker wanted to burn the car and the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.522" offset="1421662">Dickson said no... I mean, Bullock said, no, let's take the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.724" offset="1438485">And they buried... took the body and submerged it in a lake, Bullock wading out into the lake with the cast on and everything, making sure the body was securely under the water after weighting it down with concrete blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.532" offset="1485714">Now, some two days later Bullock was arrested while riding Dickson's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.590" offset="1525943">Tucker was also tried in this case, and in the case there it went to a jury also.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.328" offset="1552901">The jury decided in that case to give Mr. Tucker the life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.398" offset="1577143">The jury in this case, of course, imposed the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.968" offset="1595429">The issues, of course, are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.555" offset="1625835">The Fifth Circuit holding that since this trial, while the trial jury did not make a finding that Mr. Bullock intended to kill, or contemplated that lethal force would be used, actually killed or attempted to kill, then we cannot impose the death penalty on Mr. Bullock.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="392.405" offset="1717159">Mr. White, has the Fifth Circuit since its decision in this case ever had presented to it the question of whether the state might go back and attempt to retry on this issue, whether that might be double jeopardy of some sort?</text>

            <text syncTime="407.430" offset="1777241">Yes, they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.964" offset="1779435">In Jones versus Thigpen, which is also on cert before this Court right now, the Fifth Circuit has said that they will apply it retroactively, and if there appears to them an evidentiary sufficiency on this, or the state did not offer proof on this particular instance, even though it was tried in a pre-Enmund context, that they will apply the double jeopardy clause and forbid us from retrying them under Bollington in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.600" offset="1893956">So, we are faced with that situation in what we feel is an unfair position of being placed in, of having to have anticipated something that was not anticipated at the time these people were tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.643" offset="5038158">Of course, in Mississippi, the situation involved we will have, there are about ten cases involved now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.999" offset="5071595">We have 40 people on death row, and ten of those cases are such that this case will impact on those cases as to how this decision comes out, because there were no jury findings made in those cases, and the findings on Enmund were basically done by the Supreme Court are not made at all because it was not an issue raised before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.714" offset="5170442">We would submit that the view taken by the Eleventh Circuit is a more... approach in this particular context, that the finding of an Appellate Court on the record is done all the time, and the decision, of course, in Ross v. Kemp is totally consistent with the ruling in this Court in Enmund versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.765" offset="5274619">The basis of proportionality, relying on the facts as set forth here in Florida, throughout the Inman opinion this Court makes it plain that it was deciding a case based on proportionality, on a proportionality review of the record, and as we said earlier, later in Solem versus Helm, the same type of reasoning was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.832" offset="5378900">Each criteria set forth in Solem versus Helm was supported by Enmund as an example, and of course the argument that due process requires in Mississippi some jury finding is not persuasive, because as we possibly said earlier, that Spaziano held that there was no constitutional right to a jury determination of sentence, and therefore Enmund requires only that the death penalty cannot be imposed under the defendant's... unless the defendant's individual participation justifies it in the given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.355" offset="5521006">So, we look at these findings found by the state, by the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.811" offset="5562802">We look... the Fifth Circuit totally ignored the fact that in the sentencing instructions, that they were given the mitigating factor that the defendant was an accomplice in the capital offense, and his participation was relatively minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.851" offset="5614942">They even make the comment in the opinion that the state after this guilt phase instruction gave no other instruction that focused the jury's attention to his culpability in this crime or his participation in this crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.397" offset="6605192">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we seek affirmance of the Circuit Court's determination that Crawford Bullock could not lawfully be sentenced to death for capital murder where the jury was not instructed to find and did not find that he killed, attempted to kill, intended to kill, or contemplated the use of lethal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.464" offset="6705398">This result, dictated by this Court's decisions in Enmund, Lockett, Mullany, and others, means simply that the defendant may be resentenced properly under the amended Mississippi death penalty statute which specifically requires the jury to find that the defendant's conduct satisfies one or more of the Enmund factors before it may determine whether to impose the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.412" offset="6805185">Crawford Bullock's death sentence was imposed and upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court prior to this Court's decision in Enmund, and it was not based on his personal responsibility or his moral guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.820" offset="6854818">There are at least four things this case is not about, and I would like to start by exploring them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.707" offset="6886374">First, we seek no limit on the power of the state to define crimes, including felony murder, but we do urge consistency with this Court's own view expressed in Lockett where the Court said states have authority to make aiders and abetters equally responsible as a matter of law with principles or to enact felony murder statutes, but the definition of a crime does not automatically dictate the proper penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.809" offset="6994834">Second, we seek no redefinition or refinement of Enmund which in words of plain meaning and common understanding prohibits, we would submit, the execution of one who does not kill, attempt to kill, intend to kill, or contemplate that lethal force would be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.161" offset="9404160">Well, Your Honor, I believe when one looks at Hicks versus Oklahoma, the Fourteenth Amendment was their reply to protect a state-protected liberty interest, and that is the case upon which we were relying, but I think it is important to clarify one thing, if I may, in response to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.838" offset="9462883">It is not necessarily the case that an Appellate Court or a reviewing court, let us say, could not find that Enmund was satisfied, and let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.496" offset="9509590">First, it is not necessary that the questions that the Mississippi law now requires be asked in every capital murder case, it is not necessary that those questions precisely be asked outside the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.088" offset="9563925">If, for example, the statute under which the defendant was indicted and convicted required the jury to find that the person intentionally or with malice aforethought took life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.296" offset="9608751">The statute takes care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.179" offset="9616274">Enmund is satisfied because the man was charged with intentional killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.717" offset="9634456">Second, it is not necessary that these questions be asked, or that the jury be involved specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.604" offset="9657966">If, for example, the defendant was the sole actor in the crime, and this is undisputed, because there a jury verdict, even a general verdict of guilt under a felony, a classic felony murder statute, necessarily means that the defendant took life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.796" offset="9718779">Now, it doesn't answer the question raised by the amicus as to whether or not it is required constitutionally also to find that there was an intentional taking of life, but putting that question aside, if there is a sole actor in any of these cases in the Eleventh Circuit, the Wainwright cases, et cetera, are cases where the only person involved in the crime is the person whom the jury convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.694" offset="9798296">It would not be necessary in those cases to go back and resentence and ask question which are really pointless, because the jury has already made the determination which satisfies Enmund if Enmund does not require more than just a killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.101" offset="9847928">Third, if the defendant was convicted of felony murder but the jury found an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally killed during the commission of the predicate felony, it would not be necessary in my view to go back and require of the questions that Mississippi has decided must be put in every case could be put in other states as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.450" offset="9941342">Enmund would be satisfied, and indeed there are statutes which are quite explicit on the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.450" offset="10253349">If, for example, defendant concedes one of the Enmund factors, and this is true certainly in the Fourth Circuit case, which is cited in the briefs, Ross... Roach, excuse me, against Martin, if the defendant concedes one of the Enmund factors, then again there is no point in requiring on resentencing under Enmund a jury finding specifically addressed to the Enmund question, because the defendant has conceded it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.801" offset="11706802">The jury was not required to find that Crawford Bullock killed or attempted to kill or intended to kill or contemplated the use of lethal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.426" offset="11745254">Indeed, quite to the contrary, the jury was told that if Mr. Bullock did any act, any act which was prior to, immediately before, leading up to, connected to the commission of the crime, whether that act was done with or without any desire to effect death, then by consenting to the killing, by being there, by being geographically proximate, if you will, to the killing done by Rickie Tucker, then Crawford Bullock could be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.410" offset="11861238">We submit that does not meet and cannot meet the Enmund standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.378" offset="11873045">It could, for example, mean on the facts of this case that the jury thought it was enough that sitting in a two-door automobile, which this automobile was, Crawford Bullock opened the door at some point and Rickie Tucker stepped out of the automobile and chased the driver, ultimately the victim in this case, Mark Dickson before he beat him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.526" offset="11945665">That certainly, particularly when it is told, when the jury is told that it doesn't have to be an act with any design to cause death, that, I submit, would not meet the standard of Enmund or any other standard requiring some certainty in the capital sentencing process before the ultimate punishment of death is inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.535" offset="12013688">The jury was told, as counsel for the petitioner pointed out, in another instruction, in a conflicting instruction, that it could find Mr. Bullock guilty of capital murder and then sentence him to death if he actually killed, but that instruction was directly contradicted by the prior instructions, which said that intent didn't matter, design didn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.199" offset="12092369">Consent, whatever that was, consent was the key, and any overt act leading up to the Commission of the crime by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.221" offset="12124447">That, I submit, is not a sufficient ground for this jury or any jury, at least in the state of Mississippi, to find that this person killed or attempted to kill or intended to kill or contemplated the use of lethal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.278" offset="12172722">What was the jury to think, for example, about the meaning of the term "consent"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.664" offset="12190171">Was it to think, because consent is not defined anywhere in this charge by the Court, was it to think that it meant to agree somehow, or was it meant to think that consent meant, as the dictionary tells us it can mean, acquiescence, tacit agreement, or restraint of opposition in accepting something about which one has reservations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.744" offset="12270524">Mr. Bullock was certainly no hero in this exercise, but he had a cast on his leg which was severely injured, and he was on crutches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.999" offset="12303543">Mr. Bullock was struck by Rickie Tucker with a bottle, and his hand was severely injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.070" offset="12323814">He was in the hospital for a week after this incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.939" offset="12335308">He was not in any condition, let us say, to do anything necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.307" offset="12352758">He said, he testified, and the Mississippi Supreme Court said his testimony was consistent with his statements to the police, and was the basis upon which they recounted the facts in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.913" offset="12391210">He said he yelled at Rickie Tucker to stop hitting Mark Dickson.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.446" offset="12589322">The version of the facts was perfectly consistent with the notion that Mr. Bullock, whether he intervened as he testified, to stop the fight and was not successful, or whether he intervened for some other purpose, and there is no finding on that anywhere, there is no evidence to suggest that he held this person and this person was killed when he was holding him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.648" offset="13410194">Your Honor, it has been suggested that the Mississippi Supreme Court has decided that the law as we urge it, at least as it relates to the law of Mississippi, should not be and cannot be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.740" offset="13470485">It is, of course, our position that Mississippi law has always required that capital sentencing findings be made by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.644" offset="13494100">That is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.511" offset="13501623">Most recently, Your Honor, in a case which was not available to us when we filed our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.965" offset="13519386">It is a case entitled Gray versus the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.684" offset="13538299">It is found at 472 Southern 2nd 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.654" offset="13554181">The Mississippi Supreme Court had a recent opportunity to consider the Enmund findings, the amended statute, which we say would control if this Court affirmed and sent Mr. Bullock back to be sentenced, and we recognize double jeopardy does not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.645" offset="13606113">He could be resentenced to death if the jury found the appropriate findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.413" offset="13621264">But in that case, the court considered what would happen to Mr. Gray, because Mr. Gray had been convicted and sentenced to death prior to the amendment of the Mississippi death penalty statute requiring the jury specifically to make the Enmund findings in the language of Enmund, and what the court said, I think, was quite instructive at 472 Southern 2nd 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.363" offset="13705065">The court said that the instructions given to the jury to make Enmund... require the jury to make Enmund findings because for Gray to be found guilty and sentenced to death he had to be found by the jury to have unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, killed and murdered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.324" offset="13776849">Then the court went on to define malice aforethought as a predetermination to commit an act without legal justification or excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.394" offset="13801091">I submit that certainly supports the notion that the Mississippi Supreme Court would apply this if it were properly presented to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.632" offset="13826064">He couldn't present it to them because of the timing of the decision, but Mr. Bullock should be sent back to Mississippi to be resentenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.475" offset="13885518">The evidence in the Mississippi Supreme Court... in the evidence before the trial court there as far as the blood and everything, the testimony was that they couldn't make a determination whose blood that was on the rocks, and further, that we did not have these findings or the idea of what these findings, the specific language these findings were to be made in until some two years after Bullock was decided, three years after it was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.975" offset="13995442">So, the actual wording of the findings of the Mississippi Supreme Court as the opponents contend was not in the language of Enmund I don't think would have any bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.017" offset="14035670">We do have a finding that if he was an active participant and that active participation was holding someone by the hair of the head while somebody else beat him with a bottle or hit him with a bottle, and he, of course, at that time was injured himself, and so we do contend that the evidence is clear that Mr. Bullock was right in the middle of all this, and is certainly a candidate for the death penalty.</text>
