            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135679">We will hear arguments first this morning in 83-1968, Thornburg against Gingles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.764" offset="162637">Mr. Attorney General.</text>

          <turn speaker="lacy_h_thornburg" startTime="10.356" stopTime="218.711">
            <label>Mr. Lacy H. Thornburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.356" offset="177057">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Honorable Court, this case in its final posture before the Court involves four multi-member House legislative districts and one multi-member Senate district in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.881" offset="239124">Two other districts, House District 8 and Senate District 2 are no longer part of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.111" offset="268068">The primary challenge to the lower court's judgment by the original defendants is based on that court's interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.701" offset="314461">The Court found infirmities in each of the districts that were challenged, and ultimately fashioned a remedy requiring the use of majority black legislative single-member districts where they could be drawn, and in each of the multi-member districts as they were constituted originally, they largely followed county lines and consisted of whole counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.943" offset="395441">From this decision the defendants sought review, and the Solicitor General joined in that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.424" offset="421354">We ask this Honorable Court to apply Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act so as to afford due respect to the intentions of the Congress without endorsing the undue expansion of these intentions by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.981" offset="483526">We would encourage a decision that would enunciate definitive yet fair and realistic standards for evaluating the election practices in all jurisdictions, and we do this to the end that this Honorable Court's determinations might acknowledge the right of those jurisdictions to determine their own electoral affairs so long as they neither intentionally or unintentionally deny to any minority group the emphatic opportunity to participate fully and equally in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.859" offset="615078">We do so to the additional end that your ruling might foster political unity as opposed to disunity among the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.529" offset="645694">The Panel Court suggested that it was paying adherence to the proposition that no protected class of persons has a constitutional right or statutory right to proportional representation, or to guaranteed political success.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.177" offset="712358">But pursuant to Section 2, the Court found that it had been shown by the plaintiffs that North Carolina's political process was not open equally to participation by the racial minorities, and this was purportedly based on the use of certain factors that were denoted by the Senate in the legislative history of the Section 2 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.434" offset="813400">These factors are certainly well-known to the Court and should have been imported to the district court, not as a mechanical checklist of conclusive indicators, but rather a set of guidelines for determining whether the characteristics of the jurisdictions being examined parallel those of jurisdictions examined in the cases to which the Senate referred, particularly White versus Regester, Whitcomb versus Chavis, and Zimmer versus McKeithen.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.702" offset="934399">And, we submit that had the district court applied these factors in the manner intended, giving primary weight all the while to the words of the statute and properly analyzing the cases from which these factors came, then North Carolina would have prevailed in that Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.086" offset="1163963">Durham County, North Carolina, for example, with a 28.6 percent black registration has had proportional representation in the North Carolina House since 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.505" offset="1813681">We simply say that the court failed to apply the wording of the statute and rather than taking the statute which deals with access and opportunity to participate in the electoral process, clear wording, is simply found the various factors without making a causal connection and applied those, and simply did not apply the law, and fashioned a remedy which is specifically proscribed by the statute where it says that nothing in this should be interpreted, nothing in the section should be interpreted to establish a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.126" offset="2160169">That is our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.439" offset="2165393">And we contend that by applying the law as the court did and by fashioning the remedy in the manner in which it did, that it expanded the scope far beyond the intent of Congress in the passing of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.902" offset="2235192">These facts, as found by the court, will demonstrate that blacks in these challenged districts have run for office, are always competitive, and often win.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.021" offset="2279705">In fact, no elected black incumbent member of the General Assembly who has offered for re-election has ever been defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.128" offset="2316172">Blacks recieve Democratic Party support for their candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.844" offset="2331010">They hold positions of power and leadership within the party structure, and they have equal access to the process and to the at-large scheme and had achieved proportional representation at the time of this trial in each of the districts with the exception of Hecklenburg County.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.026" offset="2395689">We consider, of course, that voter registration as indicated by the facts in the case should be brought up to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.068" offset="2443859">In this case, for '80 to '82 statewide registration among whites decreased by 112,000 but increased by 12,000 in the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.265" offset="2496730">It's true that blacks in the challenged districts fall below whites in most of the socioeconomic indicators, but the electoral success of the blacks in these districts in the various offices, and their membership on the Board of Elections and in party position and so on indicates that the socioeconomic factors are no longer an obstacle to their participation, meaningful participation in the political process, and we suggest that it defies common sense to count these factors as indicia of unequal participation when the direct evidence as exists in these districts shows to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.669" offset="2682304">I will call to the Court's attention also that none of these counties is a Section 5 county.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.041" offset="2707800">Only 40 of our 100 counties are so covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.195" offset="2724414">The United States Attorney General required the creation of numerous single member legislative districts in these counties, and his determinations were never contested by North Carolina in any legal proceeding and were immediately implemented when those suggestions were made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.544" offset="4545775">The formulation in the new Voting Rights Act, Section 2, was the product of intense political and, may I say, intellectual struggle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.839" offset="4579003">The outcome of that struggle should be quite familiar to this Court since it simply adopted the standard, the legal standard formulated by this Court in White v. Regester.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.990" offset="4619545">Our concern in this case is one thing only, that adjudication under this new Voting Rights Act be lawful, that it be constrained and disciplined by appellate court review which enforces the standard that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.075" offset="4707943">Now, Congress chose a middle path between two extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.713" offset="4730513">On one hand was the extreme represented by the constitutional minimum of intentional discrimination, and that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.773" offset="4770742">On the other hand was the extreme of leaving the district courts at large to engineer electoral outcomes as they thought best on racial or group lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.532" offset="4821733">What the Congress adopted was, if you like, an effects test, but effects on what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.904" offset="4855274">Effects on participation, on process, on opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.854" offset="4878993">Now, if fidelity to that standard is to be enforced, then whatever nuances there may be in closer cases, it is our position that here, certainly in three and perhaps in all of the five contested districts, but certainly in three of them, we believe that that standard of access, of process, of opportunity has been met as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.450" offset="6269439">The issue presented here by the Solicitor General and by the State, I think can be put simply, whether the election of the five black candidates in 1982 in four of its challenged electoral districts, forecloses any possibility for finding that blacks in the challenged districts have been denied an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.172" offset="6392319">I don't think that anyone would seriously argue that the facts in North Carolina prior to 1982 would warrant a finding that black votes in each of the challenged districts were substantially diluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.103" offset="6456058">And so, the State and the Solicitor General now contend that because five blacks were elected in these challenged districts in 1982, that should foreclose a determination that there was a violation of Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.046" offset="11523813">As you see here, the representatives are all outside the black residential areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.543" offset="11549831">And that's true in House District 36 as well as House District 23.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.994" offset="11571565">I was wondering if you were making the point... it just occurs to me that perhaps if you had single member districts instead of multi-member, maybe you'd have the same number of blacks but they might be different blacks?</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.179" offset="11608345">That is possible, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.537" offset="11617749">What we are talking about, though, is the ability of blacks to relate to their representatives, to insure that those representatives are accountable for the way that they represent the interests of blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.439" offset="11657351">Where they live outside the district, they first of all are not accessible, and where blacks have to depend on white votes to elect representatives, they aren't necessarily accountable to the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.449" offset="11705416">We have testimony in the record how these multi-member districts affect the ability of blacks to protect and advance their own interests, and these are factors again, looking at the totality of the circumstances, that the district court looked at very intensely to determine whether vote dilution in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.379" offset="11789112">Also, if you look... the Defendants asked the Court to not apply Rule 52 in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.281" offset="11824743">I think that Rule 52 controls the determination here, and I think is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.747" offset="11854628">First if we look at the fact, we have three native North Carolinians who sat on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.212" offset="11888482">They knew the facts in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.070" offset="11903947">Prior to their appointment to the bench they had actively participated in politics in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.381" offset="11929129">One had served as a dean of a law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.630" offset="11942190">And then they looked very closely at whether there was a real opportunity for blacks to participate in each district, and we have then a careful, intense analysis by three native North Carolinians of what has taken place is each district including the 1982 election, affecting the ability of blacks to participate equally and to elect representatives of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.086" offset="12055979">Even in House District 23, where a black was elected since 1973, blacks had to make sure that the candidate running was someone who could appeal to white residents because white votes were necessary for the black to be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.000" offset="12131630">It was not possible for blacks to get a person elected without extreme single-shot voting, and a candidate who could appeal at least to a limited number of whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.743" offset="12214595">So, even in the three districts that the Solicitor General has referred to, as well as the State, blacks do not have and have not had an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process and to elect representatives of their choice.</text>
