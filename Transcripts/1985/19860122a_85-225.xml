            <text syncTime="12.908" offset="191930">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.093" offset="204678">The question presented in this case is whether respondents have a right to judicial review of matters concerning the amount of benefits under Part B of the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.615" offset="242712">Part B establishes a voluntary program of supplementary medical insurance that pays in general 80 percent of the reasonable charge of physician services and other services.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.423" offset="289941">Part A of the program, which establishes the basic hospital insurance program, is not directly involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.695" offset="323065">The principal relevance of Part A here, however, is that under Part A Congress has expressly provided for judicial review of benefit determinations where the amount in controversy exceeds $1,000, and this demonstrates that where Congress intends to provide for judicial review under the Medicaid program, it expressly does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.875" offset="407806">Under Part B, however, Congress has not affirmatively authorized judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.927" offset="427972">Four terms ago, in United States versus Erika, this Court unanimously held that by this omission Congress had deliberately foreclosed judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.635" offset="466843">The Court there relied on what Congress perceived to be the relatively insubstantial amount of money involved in the typical Part B claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.073" offset="504563">The Court adhered to this view of reviewability under Part B just two terms ago in Heckler versus Ringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.346" offset="537687">Although Congress has extensively revised the Part B program in a number of respects since Erika was decided, it has not enacted legislation to overrule that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.202" offset="581050">Bills have been introduced to accomplish that result, however, and as we point out in our reply brief the committee reports on those bills demonstrate Congress's understanding that under existing law judicial review is entirely foreclosed under Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.478" offset="638206">In these circumstances we believe it would be especially prudent for the Court to adhere to its rulings in Erika and Ringer and leave to Congress, which is studying the matter, the question of whether exceptions should be carved out to that preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.369" offset="689719">Mr. Kneedler, do you think that constitutional challenges to the application of the Secretary's guidelines concerning Part B can be challenged in court?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="160.151" offset="780834">Well, they've certainly made a constitutional claim.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="162.753" stopTime="208.215">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="162.753" offset="791283">--They have made a constitutional claim, but it is our submission, for the reasons we have stated in the brief, that it is so insubstantial as not to vest the Court with subject matter jurisdiction under the rationale that the Court disposed of the constitutional claim in Ringer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.410" offset="845932">We think that's so because the regulation that's being challenged simply authorizes the establishment of separate charge screens, or prevailing charge screens, based on the charging patterns that exist in the community, and where a carrier implements that principle and adopts separate prevailing charge screens that are simply based on the charging patterns in the community, we think that that can in no way be thought to be so utterly lacking in rational justification under Flemming versus Nestor as to--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="208.215" offset="973096">Well, it did... it did appear to me, anyway, that the plaintiffs below made three different kinds of challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.137" offset="1004756">One was to the carrier's utilization and application of the Secretary's rules on Part B, and second was a challenge to the Secretary's regulations themselves, and an allegation that the Secretary's regulations did not meet the statutory requirements that Congress had laid down, and third, a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.638" offset="1110813">Now, do you think that Erika precludes the constitutional challenge?</text>
            <text syncTime="250.561" offset="1142474">I guess you think not, but you think it's insubstantial?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.945" offset="1160028">Erika, we think, didn't address it because there was not a constitutional question raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.567" offset="1206526">On that question, we think the judicial review is plainly foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.805" offset="1223453">In Erika... Erika itself involved a challenge to instructions from the Secretary that is, insofar as the carrier is concerned, there is binding regulations, and the Court--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="280.410" offset="1261905">The language in Erika doesn't make too clear that that was intended.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="285.464" offset="1282072">--But the Court of Claims decision in Erika, however, at pages 590 to 591 of 634 F. 2d do discuss the carrier's challenge to the intermediary letter upon which the carrier relied and also several additional letters implementing that, and the Court of Claims did review the carrier's... the question of the carrier's reliance on those letters and held that they were not a valid basis for the carrier to deny claims.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="312.282" stopTime="327.391">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="312.282" offset="1389383">Well, why would a challenge to the regulation as not meeting the statutory requirement be a burden to the Court such as review of the typical Part B benefit claim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="327.391" stopTime="471.685">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="327.391" offset="1449778">Well, the typical Part B benefit claim might well often include a challenge to a regulation or instruction or legal principles upon which the carrier relied, and it would not be difficult for a claimant to allege that.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.615" offset="1498679">And I would point but that there are now over 300 million claims a year filed under the Part B program and more than 30 million enrollees, so the potential for bringing these questions into court is rather substantial, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.894" offset="1563881">Also, the premise of Erika that Congress has precluded judicial review of matters concerning the amount of benefits extends not simply to the factual determinations but to the legal ones as well, because a decision on a claim for benefits is really analogous to a court's judgement which includes not simply findings of fact but the application of law to it, and so where Congress has precluded review of a decision concerning the amount of benefits, that necessarily includes the legal rules that the carrier has applied in arriving at that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.750" offset="1711212">As we have pointed out in our brief from the beginning, the regulations governing the carrier hearing program have provided that the carrier's decision on a claim for benefits is final and binding and it is not subject to further review, and that the carrier is to adhere to the Secretary's view of the meaning of the statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.247" offset="1789265">Putting these together, we think it's quite clear that the preclusion of review of amount of benefits under Part B includes questions of law or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.419" offset="1829912">One other point I'd like to make in this regard is if the Secretary had never issued the regulation involved in this case, and the carrier had simply relied on its own interpretation of the statute, that it's clear that judicial review would be precluded under the rationale of Erika because there in Erika as here, there was a statutory challenge to the prevailing fee limitation that the carrier was using.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.772" offset="1939313">In fact, it was a challenge based on the very same sentence of the Act upon which respondents rely in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.676" offset="1967003">All that has happened here is that the Secretary has given some interpretive guidance to the carriers explaining what he understands the Act to mean, but the issuance of a regulation should not in our view provide a vehicle for judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.685" offset="2026980">What if the Secretary promulgated a regulation abolishing carrier review entirely?</text>
            <text syncTime="477.089" offset="2048609">Would that be reviewable, do you suppose... just said it cost too much money?</text>

            <text syncTime="589.428" offset="2498020">The abolishment of the claims adjudication process is not an issue that arises in the adjudication process itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.604" offset="2566670">But the principle that we're relying on, and it's not just in the Medicare program but it's reflected more broadly in Section 405-H of the Act, is that in the Social Security Act Congress has carefully considered when it wants to have judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.399" offset="2629886">It affirmatively authorizes it typically by incorporating Section 4O5-G, the provision for judicial review in District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.084" offset="2756632">In Ringer the argument was made that because the one claimant, Ringer, had not submitted a claim for benefits and therefore could not get into the claims adjudication process that culminates in 405-G, that he should have a right of action under the general type of question jurisdiction, 1331, the argument being that 405-H shouldn't preclude review where it's not available under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.510" offset="3730268">And Congress did provide for judicial review, but significantly it limited it to situations in which there's $1,000 or more in controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.750" offset="3783244">Indeed, the one beneficiary who is a plaintiff in this case, the practical difference, the difference in reimbursement levels that's at issue here is about $1.60 an office visit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="988.049" offset="4092430">There are several.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.918" offset="4099953">There is an annual evaluation of the carrier's performance that is conducted by the... that is conducted by HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, which is an assessment of the carrier's overall performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.593" offset="4154601">This is discussed at some length in our briefs in McClure four terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.812" offset="4175499">One aspect of that, and it's discussed in the testimony in the record in this case, was that there was an evaluation of the prevailing charge levels that the carrier uses, not necessarily poring over the statistical data but just making sure that the carrier is using the right approach in evaluating that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.075" offset="4268599">The other form of oversight is, as I mentioned, quarterly quality reviews of the carrier's performance by individual hearing officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.466" offset="4306111">Another mechanism available to a person affected by the Part B program would be to file, and particularly in this case where there's a regulation of the Secretary, would be to file a rule-making petition with the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.893" offset="4367865">If the respondents in this case believe that in fact the data now supports elimination of any differential in charging patterns based on specialty, that a petition for rulemaking could be submitted to the Secretary along with relevant supporting data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.670" offset="4438918">So, there are mechanisms that can be resorted to, and along these same lines Congress had last year commissioned a study by the Office of Technology Assessment which we also point out in our brief under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, to study the differences in charge levels for physicians' services according not only to specialty differences but the locality and the type of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.672" offset="4550931">So, there's also rather extensive congressional oversight or the way in which the Part B program is administered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.594" offset="4582591">But the question here is so basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.045" offset="4592413">It's an allegation that the statute says if the services provided by the physicians are identical, that no different level of compensation is permitted, based on specialization, and that's a pretty basic question, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.626" offset="4674751">Well, what the statute says is that the reasonable charge cannot exceed 75 percent of the customary charges for similar services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.517" offset="4722294">It certainly seems to us to be a reasonable construction of the phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.236" offset="4737236">"similar services, to take into account differences in specialty, and in fact this regulation was promulgated at the very time the Medicare program was being implemented. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.491" offset="4774225">So, we don't have here any aberrational or startling implementation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.828" offset="4795541">In 45 states the carriers are using this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.630" offset="4814768">I would point out again that in Erika the statutory challenge to the prevailing charge ceiling was under the very same statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.319" offset="4853533">That sentence requires that the similar charges be accumulated and evaluated as made during the preceding calendar year, and the provider there argued that during the calendar year means over the course of the calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.232" offset="4933154">It doesn't permit the carrier to select just one date in the middle of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.584" offset="4946634">And, I submit that that is every bit as, in one sense, basic to the way the program is being administered, but the Court unanimously held that judicial review is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.177" offset="4996998">And this is essential in a program of this magnitude with 300 million claims annually, to have the oversight be conducted by an expert agency, by the Secretary, in reviewing the manner in which the carriers perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.103" offset="5060632">And this is done, as I have said, through the oversight function, and to have judicial review of these matters without regard to the amount in controversy as permitted here would substantially undermine the efficiency of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.530" offset="5118415">One other point I wanted to make about reviewing the regulation is that not only did Erika involve instructions analogous to a regulation but so did Ringer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.421" offset="5165958">In fact, that was the principal challenge of Ringer, was a contesting of an instruction that prohibited a carrier from paying any amount of benefits for a particular service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.693" offset="5207022">What we have here is not a prohibition of the payment of any amounts, but just concerns the amount of benefits which is something that the carrier is particularly expert in addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.000" offset="5252266">Several other ways in which the respondents and the court of appeals have attempted to avoid the force of Erika and Ringer in this case, I think also should be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.408" offset="5297928">One is that the Court of Appeals suggested, is that the preclusion of review under Erika and Ringer doesn't apply to someone other than the claimant for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.431" offset="5342023">The Court of Appeals didn't explain what it meant by that, but it apparently meant positions rather than the Part P beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.954" offset="5368041">Respondents don't defend that argument here, and I don't see how it could be defended, because in Erika itself it wasn't the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.924" offset="5395940">It was the assignee, the provider of the services who brought the action, and judicial review was foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.809" offset="5415479">By the same token, respondents argue that they aren't really bringing a claim for benefits in the sense that they want monetary relief directly from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.332" offset="5449543">They are just challenging the methodology for the calculation of the prevailing charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.450" offset="5466052">Again, this was exactly what was at issue in Erika.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.587" offset="5478591">The Court of Claims, whose judgment was reviewed here, did not get into the question of adjudicating individual claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.657" offset="5502937">They remanded to the carrier to apply what it viewed as the correct standards, and had the carrier process the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.145" offset="5532821">So, again that furnishes no basis for distinguishing Erika or Ringer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan G. Gilchrist</label>
            <text syncTime="1618.853" offset="6615649">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.155" offset="6628919">There are two basic issues on the merits of this case where petitioners state the respondents have no relief whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.578" offset="6662565">The first issue pertains to the equal protection claim, and the placement of family physicians, and those patients who choose family physicians, separate from all other physicians and essentially equating the selection of a family physician with that of a chiropractor or a podiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.158" offset="6744903">Now, the government states today that that equal protection count had no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.912" offset="6771861">The fact of the matter is, the government filed a motion for summary judgment on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.315" offset="6793491">It was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.334" offset="6797566">It was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.517" offset="6802372">And the government did not appeal that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.219" offset="6821181">It is also a fact that the lower court in this case stated that the government's action utterly lacked merit, utterly lacked reason, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.360" offset="6865693">The Sixth Circuit pertained to the government's action as durational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.430" offset="6885964">But perhaps most important, as to the government's position today, as the government conceded at trial it had no rationale for the placement of board eligible family Physicians who all, by definition, have completed residency programs along with chiropractors and podiatrists and sep rate from their peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.694" offset="6979065">The statutory question is basically the other major issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.248" offset="7001216">It's important to bear in mind that the Medicare statute repeatedly uses the word "similar services" in determining reasonable charges under Part B of the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.507" offset="7050327">The regulation in question doesn't even contain the words "similar services".</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.744" offset="7075195">Nobody testified at trial in this case that the Secretary attempted to define "similar service", or that the Secretary even considered similarity of service in implementing this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.052" offset="7132456">Basically, it is the respondent's position that a reasonable and consistent interpretation of the Medicare statute is that there is 1331 jurisdiction for both these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.495" offset="7190239">We've also addressed the issue of due process and separation of powers, but I think it is essentially not important for purposes of a statutory interpretation because we firmly believe that a consistent reading of the statute supports the respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.023" offset="7256381">And we have tried to set forth in detail the types of issues for which there is no judicial review and the types of issues for which there is judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.664" offset="7302879">One of the problems I have with the petitioner's position before this Court is, they have never explained in any detail what types of issues there may be judicial review of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.639" offset="7350839">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.239" offset="7357213">Do the petitioners maintain today that when a lawsuit is filed on the basis of equal protection, and the government concedes no rationale for its actions, that there is no federal court judicial review or no forum anywhere to address the issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.351" offset="7429625">The government makes that concession, at least to the portion of the claim in this case, and then ignore it, and essentially they refuse to grant any relief voluntarily and they maintain no jurisdiction in the district court, and apparently by making that concession all they want to accomplish is to have the respondents quit talking about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.264" offset="7513321">To give another example, let's assume that the Secretary, by regulation, decided not to pay family physicians at all, or the patients that choose family physicians, But those services aren't similar to anybody else's services, so they just won't pay them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.778" offset="7595345">Is that subject to review anywhere?</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.730" offset="7607153">Or, the Secretary is satisfied that the office visits performed by family physicians... and incidentally, their paint of $1.50 an office visit, that was one type of office visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.054" offset="7664518">As a matter of fact, for comprehensive office visits for Carol Diedrich, they cut it in half from $50 to $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.159" offset="7692939">But if the Secretary is prepared and satisfied that the office visits performed by family physicians are similar to office visits performed by chiropractors, I suppose the Secretary might take one... just one step further and decide that they were only covered for office visits and spinal stipulations on the part of family physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.425" offset="7793981">Is that subject to no review?</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.544" offset="7802444">If the Secretary promulgates the regulation of sickle cell anemia, services will not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.715" offset="7827104">Is that subject to review?</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.215" offset="7833164">Perhaps that's a suspect clasification, well, let me give another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.119" offset="7852704">A terminally ill patient, they die too soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.154" offset="7864825">We won't pay for those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.054" offset="7872452">Clearly in conflict with the statute, does the government state there is no review for those types of issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.308" offset="7897530">Now, I've conceded under the Erika case, there is no judicial review of an amount of benefit determination made by a clearing officer after hearing, and that is the issue in the Erika case, not whether there is judicial review of any issue concerning the amount of benefits for which there may be no other determination available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.125" offset="7996795">It says a mouthful, that concession, and the case law tells us the types of issue the carrier routinely conducts hearings on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.862" offset="8031695">In the McClure case, for example, whether a sex change operation is medically necessary, whether an ambulance should have taken a patient to the nearest hospital or to a hospital 30 miles away, whether an appendectomy performed on the same patient on the same day can be billed along with other major abdominal surgery or if it is incidental to and included as part of the bill for the appendectomy, from the Herzog case from the Sixth Circuit, or the Rainer case, whether a medical procedure is a recognized and bona fide medical procedure that the Medicare program should pay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan G. Gilchrist</label>
            <text syncTime="2017.724" offset="8211208">That's precisely the point, Your Honor, that this issue in this case, several issues of statutory construction, but the reality of this case is, there is no hearing, The carrier has expertise and authority, expertise and experiencer, rather, as well a authority to make the decision on issues such as the issues that I've set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.423" offset="8297935">They make those types of determinations every day in their private insurance business, and Congress delegated to a private insurance company under 1395-U the authority to make the same types of determinations and to conduct hearings to make those types of determinations under Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.468" offset="8378183">That's in substantial contrast to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.622" offset="8390722">this case involves a constitutional claim and a claim that a regulation promulgated by the Secretary violates the Medicare statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.744" offset="8431264">Certainly the carrier, non-lawyer hearing officer, has no great expertise and experience to address this type of issue, but perhaps more importantly the Secretary recognizes that fact when the Secretary implemented the statute, because the Secretary specifically barred the carrier hearing officer from making any comment on it, never mind making a determination on the legality of a regulation promulgated by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.080" offset="8548606">Here we asked for a hearing and the government quite correctly stated we're not entitled to a hearing on these issues, and then they turn around in the same breath state, well, if there's any mechanism at all it's the carrier hearing mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.221" offset="8601164">Congress simply did not intend to delegate those types of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.958" offset="8620077">The legislative history makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.243" offset="8629272">Let me point out just very briefly, on the separation of powers and the due process issue that I've pressed from the briefs... I don't want to get into detail as to Northern Pipeline, the Mathews versus Eldridge, and the McClure case which is a Medicare Part B case, but I concede that there is a great deal of flexibility in the amount of due process that must be afforded in social welfare cases to balance the private interest involved and the risk of erroneous deprivation versus the public interest in avoiding the burden of having to provide additional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.904" offset="8795829">By the way, both the Mathews case and the McClure case were allegations of entitlement to additional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.926" offset="8828012">Here there can be no meaningful hearing at any time on the issues that have been raised, and I think this Court has steadfastly maintained the position, they certainly did in the Mathews versus Eldridge case, that if due process means anything it means a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.055" offset="8900528">Here there is no hearing before the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.506" offset="8910245">There is no hearing before a federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.123" offset="8920799">And if you accept the petitioner's position in this case, there's no hearing before any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.279" offset="8945354">Erika, according to petitioners today, stands for the proposition that there is no judicial review of any issue that may affect the amount of benefits under Part B of the Medicare program, whether there's a determination available anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.407" offset="9025915">I've gone back and looked at the Erika case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.959" offset="9036051">I've looked at the decision of the carrier in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.745" offset="9051202">I've looked at the Court of Appeals decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.799" offset="9063427">And I simply don't agree that the carrier is bound by any instructions in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.535" offset="9090385">The issue was, during the last preceding year, the statutory issue, the regulation used the same words, during the last preceding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.324" offset="9129569">There was a small issue, basically a side issue concerning retroactive adjustment in that case, that may or may not have involved a carrier following instructions from the Secretary in the form of letters, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.686" offset="9199055">But I couldn't find in the opinion where the carrier stated that they were bound and could not make such determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.007" offset="9224237">But I think more important than that, if the government wants to take the position that Erika stands for the proposition that there's no hearing on any issue that may involve the amount of benefits, whether another available mechanism is available, even through a carrier hearing, they should have disclosed that to the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.437" offset="9310023">I note that Justice Powell's opinion in the Erika case paraphrases in essence what the position of the petitioners was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.578" offset="9350565">There it is stated that the petitioner argues that Congress specifically precluded review in the Court of Claims of adverse hearing officer determinations of the amount of Part B benefit payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.987" offset="9408243">The position of the respondents today is that a consistent reading of the Medicare statute... and incidentally, the Erika case was based upon not a specific statement from Congress because... from the statute, because 1395 double-F does not explicitly bar judicial review of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.818" offset="9495492">Rather, it relied upon the grant of judicial review of determination for the amount of benefits under Part A of the Medicare program and silenced the Part B, coupled with the legislative history to reach the conclusion that there's no review of hearing officer determinations after hearing the amount of benefits under Part B of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.366" offset="9589742">But the legislative history, and a logical and a consistent reading of that statute, is that the congressional intent to bar jurisdiction under Part B ties in directly and is related to the issues where Congress gave authority to the carrier to make those types of determinations under 1395-U.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.549" offset="9682425">And the issues that Congress intended to bar are those issues such as the types I've already raised where the carrier has expertise and has authority, and the legislative history supports not petitioner's interpretation about that, but rather respondent's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.427" offset="9757971">The Senate committee report which petitioners cite as authority for their position at the inception of the passage of the Medicare statute simply stated that there was a hearing on the amount of benefits under Part B of the Medicare program by the carrier and there is no judicial review of such determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.959" offset="9848145">Or when the statute was amended in 1972, again petitioners rely upon this language, the conference committee report also cited in Erika opinion, states there is no authorization for judicial review under Part B for matters involving solely... and that's Congress's word, not mine... the amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.174" offset="9945008">It's simply the logic and consistent reading of the statute, taken in proper context, is Congress intended that some issues certainly be conducted through a carrier hearing, and there is no judicial review of that carrier determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.851" offset="10011672">But there is nothing in the legislative history that Congress intended to preclude any issues under Part B of the Medicare program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.154" offset="10144896">First of all, there's a serious question here as to whether this could be an amount of benefit case at all, and let me give you some examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.910" offset="10175930">The board certified family physicians, respondents in this case, are asking for a reduction in benefits, in essence, if you accept the government's position about equalizing the amount of payments because they are in the specialist screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.187" offset="10237056">The context of amount of benefits, the language of the legislative history that pertains to determinations on amount of benefits, and even within Part A where they grant judicial review of determinations on amount of benefits, has to be tied in together with the grant of authority to the carrier to make determinations on amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.719" offset="10335172">We could dance all day in terms of what those three words mean, amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.356" offset="10353667">But the fact of the matter is, when we read the legislative history we know what Congress meant by those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.427" offset="10378013">It meant those issues for which the carrier has expertise and experience and for which a hearing can be conducted at the carrier level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.716" offset="10411136">Does that help clarify it at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.533" offset="10418346">Okay, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.485" offset="10426183">As to 405-A in Salfi and Weiner, the interesting part about the petitioner's brief is, they don't cite a single case for the proposition that the last sentence of 405-H which states that there is... no action may be taken under 1331 against the Secretary, U.S. Government officer and employee thereof to recover on any claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.516" offset="10522314">They don't cite a single case where that last sentence was taken out of context with the balance of 405-H which is clearly precluding 1331 jurisdiction of findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing, and precluding judicial review by any tribunal of findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.500" offset="10622310">I don't want to get into a dispute as to whether or not Ringer had a sufficient reason for attempting to bypass, and that's clearly what that was, a bypass of the review mechanism under Part A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.760" offset="10679257">He attempted to bypass 405-B and 405G.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.895" offset="10695871">I think the strongest statement that may be made from the Weiner decision is where Congress has provided for a federal administrative hearing such as they did under 405-B and where Congress has provided for judicial review of that federal administrative hearing such as they did in Weiner under 405-G, that mechanism must be followed and there is no reason that may justify a bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.814" offset="10815512">I think that's about as we can go in the Weiner decision, and that states it very strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.135" offset="10836828">Justice Rehnquist in that decision stated that the last sentence of 405-H cannot change meaning based upon whether or not a party has followed the mechanism available within 405-G, whether they've satisfied prerequisites, I think were the exact words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.751" offset="10927316">But here that's an absolute, irrelevant issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.869" offset="10943721">There are no prerequisites under 405-G for the respondents to follow because 405-G simply doesn't apply, and the proper context, the last sentence of 1331, simply states that one may not bring 1331 jurisdiction to review a decision by the Secretary through an administrative hearing process where 405-G provides the judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.389" offset="11065765">That's in essence, also, the finding in the Salfi decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.239" offset="11077259">As I stumble through the interpretation of the Medicare statute I'm reminded by a statement Justice Powell made in the Gray Panther lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.899" offset="11127832">He quoted from lower court decision that characterized the Social Security Act a an aggravated assault on the English language, and I certainly agree with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.854" offset="11171718">The fact of the matter is, a single sentence from the statute or even worse, a single sentence from the legislative history can be taken out of context to support virtually any position anybody wants to take, and I think that's in essence what the government has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.601" offset="11250712">They've taken the last sentence of 405-H and they've ignored the balance of that section which is clearly in the context of no 1331 jurisdiction, where Congress has provided for a federal administrative hearings for judicial review, and they are attempting to take that sentence outside of that context and say that clearly and convincingly, Congress intended to bar 1331 jurisdiction for any claims under Part B.</text>

I'm not positive... that this Court has been asked to hear more Part B cases involving jurisdiction, and there's been Part B cases filed in the Senate of Michigan, in Federal District Court on the merits, and as a matter of fact Michigan is...

            <text syncTime="2858.985" offset="11576198">But what the government does is to keep raising this floodgate issue, but as a matter of fact circuits prior to Erika found jurisdiction even on the types of issues we now concede there's not jurisdiction, and they've never supplied this Court with the data as to the number of cases that have been filed, the number of Federal District Court cases or Court of Claims cases.</text>
