            <label>Mr. Robert L. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="74.564" offset="441692">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.625" offset="461963">This case comes from the State of California which has order Pacific Gas and Electric Company to include in its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitation messages of a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.135" offset="519955">We are required to include the message four times per year for a two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.006" offset="551406">For the past 60 years, PG&amp;E has used the billing envelope to communicate its message through the PG&amp;E Progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.142" offset="596023">The envelope has never been open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.922" offset="607099">The California Supreme Court refused to hear Appellant's petition for writ of review, thus upholding the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.699" offset="646178">That decision was appealed to this Court, which noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="669062">The issue presented on appeal is whether or not the State of California can, consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, compel Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a privately owned, public utility, to include in its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitation of a third party, in this case, TURN, Toward Utility Rate Normalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.048" offset="775641">Utility speech is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.123" offset="795912">In Consolidated Edison, this Court decided in 1980 that the State of New York could not regulate the political speech that Consolidated Edison put in the billing envelope unless the state showed a compelling state interest for that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.757" offset="866443">The right not to carry the message of others applies, indeed, to a corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.519" offset="901551">First National Bank of Boston versus Bellotti, decided in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.423" offset="929137">In that case, this Court was faced with the issue as to whether or not the corporation was entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.015" offset="959439">As a matter of fact, that was the first time the issue was squarely presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.326" offset="972709">And, Justice Powell writing for the Court, said that the inherent worth of speech is not determined by identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.479" offset="1005310">He said that you look not to the identity of the person who is asserting the right, you look to see if the right that is being asserted is a right that is protected by the First Amendment.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="255.307" stopTime="311.549">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="255.307" offset="1164657">There is no case that specifically holds that in the case of a corporation, however, we do rely heavily upon at least two cases, Miami Herald versus Tornillo and Wooley versus Maynard.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.627" offset="1225888">In the Miami Herald case, the Court held that the State of Florida could not compel the Miami Herald to publish the reply messages of third parties and in that decision Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, indicated that although the State of Florida made good arguments in terms of why a wide variety of views are necessary or desired, but the Court says in each instance where there is an enforced right of excess... access... necessarily calls for some mechanism, either consentual or governmental.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="311.549" offset="1389623">Do you think there is a difference between a newspaper, which is not a regulated enterprise, and a public utility, which is quite strictly regulated, a difference for these purposes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="324.871" stopTime="379.911">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="324.871" offset="1442913">For these purposes, I think that the same principle that applies in Tornillo should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.493" offset="1473424">The mere fact of regulation, as this Court indicated in Consolidated Edison, does not preclude a utility from asserting First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.145" offset="1520027">In Tornillo, the difference, of course, is that Tornillo involved a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.751" offset="1546462">Here we are involved with a situation where you have a utility's billing envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.749" offset="1570391">But, the principle is the same; that is, as the Court said in Tornillo, newspapers should not be compelled to publish that which reason tells them should not be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.432" offset="1625143">Here a utility should not be compelled to carry a message in the billing envelope that reason tells it should not be carried.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="379.911" offset="1663073">Yes, but hasn't the Court distinguished between different kinds of media?</text>
            <text syncTime="384.675" offset="1682090">The Red Lion case, for example, involving the fairness doctrine who was dealing with the broadcast station which is regulated in a sense and yet the broadcasters are required to do certain things.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="403.824" stopTime="443.745">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="403.824" offset="1758681">In the case of Red Lion, there Red Lion did not rest upon the basis that the broadcasters had a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.804" offset="1810613">It rested rather upon the basis that they were using a scarce resource that was not open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.690" offset="1850214">Here, the mail is not a scarce resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.594" offset="1865783">And, as the Court reasoned in Red Lion, and again emphasized in Consolidated Edison, is that a broadcaster can only communicated through those scarce resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.844" offset="14422845">I think it is even more important here, because here the State of California has at its disposal many other ways to resolve this problem and it never has to become involved in picking this group or picking that group.</text>
