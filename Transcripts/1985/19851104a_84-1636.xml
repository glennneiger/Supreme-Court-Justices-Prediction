            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="126073">We will hear arguments first this morning in Morris against Mathews.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.320" offset="159301">Mr. Drake, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="19.562" stopTime="94.010">
            <label>Mr. Richard David Drake</label>
            <text syncTime="19.562" offset="204231">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.746" offset="216979">The issue in this case is, under what circumstances a jeopardy barred criminal conviction may be modified to that of a lesser and included offense which is not jeopardy barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.637" offset="264522">It is submitted that such a remedy is available, unless the defendant alleges and demonstrates that evidence otherwise inadmissible in a trial for the lesser and included offense was presented to the tryer of fact during the course of the jeopardy barred trial, and that such evidence resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.670" offset="352711">A conviction can thus be modified, unless a defendant specifically identifies the claimed inadmissible evidence and demonstrates its prejudicial impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.442" offset="395761">Such cases are analogous to the spillover prejudice that arises in misjoinder of offense cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.131" offset="426586">Whereas here, the same evidence would have been admitted in a trial for the lesser and included offense, as what is admitted during the jeopardy barred trial, a per se rule of automatic reversal can only serve to force the defendant and the prosecution to yet a third proceeding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="94.010" stopTime="99.814">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="94.010" offset="502027">Mr. Drake, would all the same evidence be admissible, in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="99.814" stopTime="119.260">
            <label>Mr. Richard David Drake</label>
            <text syncTime="99.814" offset="525329">In the case before the Court, all the evidence would be admissible had the Respondent in this case been indicted for murder; in other words, had the prosecution not sought the enhanced penalty, and we are talking here about an enhanced penalty case, the evidence would have been identical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="119.260" stopTime="130.551">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="119.260" offset="603069">I guess your... the Respondent takes the position that not every bit of that evidence would be admissible at the new trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="130.551" stopTime="438.132">
            <label>Mr. Richard David Drake</label>
            <text syncTime="130.551" offset="648209">In the brief of the Respondent before this Court, he fails to identify one iota of evidence that came in, in the jeopardy barred trial, that would not have come in in the murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="696796">I believe perusal of his brief demonstrates such.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.744" offset="712992">He does not identify one shred of testimonial or physical evidence that was presented, and it must be borne in mind that this case was not tried in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.885" offset="757609">The very motive for the homicide was to cover up the bank robbery, by the Respondent's own admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.824" offset="797315">In other words, but for the commission of the bank robbery, the homicide would never have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.095" offset="822393">An analysis of the facts of the instant case demonstrates the remedial action taken by the Ohio Appellate Court was wholly consistent with the double jeopardy clause and the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.570" offset="884251">It's undisputed that Respondent and his accomplice robbed a federally insured bank at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.391" offset="907552">During the opening statements at the trial in question, the defense attorney informed the jury that defense did not contest the fact that the Respondent was a participant in the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.751" offset="961051">Upon exiting the bank the witness saw a vehicle and reported the license number, and a high speed chase immediately ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.174" offset="994697">The chase ended when the Respondent and his accomplice went to a farmhouse in order to take hostages.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.077" offset="1026357">They were unsuccessful in this endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.112" offset="1034507">The house was completely surrounded by various law enforcement officers from a variety of jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.349" offset="1059376">Two shots were heard in the home, at which time Respondent exited.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.753" offset="1085080">The accomplice was found dead, having suffered a fatal blow to the heart at point-blank range with a sawed off single shot shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.791" offset="1125204">Respondent was taken into custody and gave a series of statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.845" offset="1141400">His initial statement to the police was made under oath and reported by a stenographer.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.683" offset="1168777">He therein stated that he had been kidnapped by the accomplice, and that both his life and that of his girlfriend had been threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.105" offset="1202422">Therefore, he participated unwillingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.224" offset="1214961">That very evening agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived and Respondent conceded that he was in fact a willing participant in the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.663" offset="1252682">He did, however, deny having shot the accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.817" offset="1277237">The following day Respondent was taken and given a polygraph examination which he passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.006" offset="1306076">He later made a statement to the police wherein he admitted he had fixed the test by crossing his toes and otherwise making efforts to fool the polygraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.830" offset="1357381">Inexplicably the initial coroner's report ruled the cause of death to be suicide, a rather startling report which proved to be wholly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.705" offset="1404819">The coroner indicated that shots had come from a high powered rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.824" offset="1421329">It's undisputed that they came from the same saved-off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.394" offset="1443585">The Respondent was indicted only for the bank robbery and promptly entered a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.797" offset="1469185">Two days thereafter, while in the county jail, Respondent asked to speak with the investigating officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.968" offset="1493844">That request was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.087" offset="1502413">For the first time the Respondent admitted having murdered his accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.974" offset="1525923">A verbatim transcript of the Respondent's handwritten statement is included in the Joint Appendix at pages 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.645" offset="1552568">Of material import, Respondent said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="360.115" offset="1566465">"I said to myself real quick that if he was dead I could say that I was kidnapped and they couldn't prove that I robbed the bank. "</text>
            <text syncTime="367.853" offset="1597394">Respondent later gave a tape recorded confession where he reiterated his... the reason for the homicide to cover up the bank robbery, escape culpability, and perhaps return and recover the $15,000 in stolen money which he had hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.230" offset="1670955">After his confession Respondent was indicted for what is called aggravated murder, which is that he did purposely cause the death of another and the aggravating circumstance here being that of fleeing from an aggravated or armed robbery, the distinction between simple murder, which is the highest level of homicide in Ohio, and aggravated murder is that the Ohio General Assembly has made a legislative judgment that a murder, an intentional killing committed under certain circumstances, here while fleeing a bank robbery, warrant enhanced punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.891" offset="1829570">While the aggravating factor here, the bank robbery, is an element of the crime it is not a lesser included offense, and the trial judge would err were he to instruct you on the bank robbery itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.324" offset="1939284">They were confronted with a coroner's report which was wholly erroneous, which ruled the cause of death suicide, and they also were confronted with the fact that he had taken and passed a polygraph examination, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.955" offset="2021831">The forensic pathologist from Cincinnatti, Ohio, had forwarded his findings to the prosecutor, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.144" offset="2054641">They were aware that the coroner's factual assessment was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.732" offset="2080973">They were not, obviously, aware that his conclusions vis-a-vis suicide is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.635" offset="2104587">The conclusion stood, and they were also faced with someone who, a day after the commission of the act, had passed this polygraph test, albeit he had fooled the operator and later conceded such.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.009" offset="2150040">As a matter of fact, he later took a stipulated polygraph examination and failed it quite miserably when he was not allowed to cheat.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.533" offset="3748107">This case is very much akin to the resolution that this Court made in Benton versus Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.835" offset="3849358">Here, what the Petitioner wants to do... this is unlike a typical constitutional violation, a Griffin violation, search and seizure violation, where the violation of the Constitution itself is concrete, identifiable, and is the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.296" offset="3919157">What the Respondent wants to do is take an entire trial that might span weeks and look to mere, simple state evidentiary principles, materiality, hearsay, et cetera and ask the federal judiciary to get involved in an ad hoc analysis of whether or not the state judiciary would have made the same evidentiary rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.226" offset="4010899">This Court has never taken that Draconian step and there is absolutely no precedent for that, and again I would indicate that this case is a Benton versus Maryland spillover prejudice type case.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.902" offset="4069622">To reverse this conviction, as I stated earlier, would serve no useful purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.385" offset="6951555">It was not until State versus Thomas was decided in Ohio in 1980, two years later, that an interlocutory appeal could be pursued by a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.459" offset="6999830">I suggest that the fundamental difference of opinion is over identification of the interests protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.917" offset="7045701">In the language of Price versus Georgia, what the State is requesting be done here is the conducting of a harmless error test, comparing the trial which did take place to a trial which they imagine would have taken place had they been originally prosecuted with respect to his double jeopardy rights on a charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.299" offset="7143190">But, this Court in Price, also in a unanimous decision... and I suggest these are the few bedrock decisions in double jeopardy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.805" offset="7173283">These are the decisions where the Court could agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.590" offset="7184359">Price rejected application of a harmless error test which is in effect being proposed here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.511" offset="7212049">The decisions which have been unanimous in the double jeopardy area are cases in which issues were presented to this Court that called for their resolution by this Court, upon the Court to look not at interpretation of the language of the clause but to focus its attention instead on identification of the protected interests of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.526" offset="7308075">And, this Court has repeatedly said that the interest in a successive prosecution double jeopardy situation is the interest of the accused in remaining free from that second trial for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.703" offset="7360842">That's all Mr. Mathews is asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.669" offset="7368679">He is asking that the decisions in Price, in Abney, in Burks, be applied to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.841" offset="7397413">And I suggest very frankly that in order to give approval to modification as a remedy to a successive prosecution double jeopardy violation, which violation is admitted here, this Court would have to overrule part two of Price versus Georgia, would have to overrule the reasoning set forth in Abney, because interlocutory appeal is inconsistent with modification on direct review, and would have to overrule Burks to the extent that it says the sweep of the clause is absolute under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.065" offset="7538266">I believe that in appropriately deciding this case, one must look and keep in mind that the clause was written, intended to protect the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.789" offset="7589152">It was not intended to benefit the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.407" offset="7599601">The sufficiency and the appropriateness of a remedy which is proposed should be viewed through the eyes of the party designed to be protected, and this is certainly not an appropriate remedy through the eyes of the accused in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.898" offset="7657593">Mr. Mathews was first a victim of a violation of his constitutional rights when Ohio forced him into a trial which they now admit they could not force him into, consistent with those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.390" offset="7707539">After that, after his constitutional rights were violated, and after a three-year process through which he appealed, finally this Court remanded in light of Illinois versus Vitale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.115" offset="7754455">Then what the Lincoln County Court of Appeals did was compound, not remedy but compound the wrong done to him by saying to him, yes, your constitutional rights have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.473" offset="7807954">As a remedy to that we are going to deem you a convicted murderer and sentence you to serve a period of 15 years to life in the Lucasville penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.862" offset="7841495">That is not a remedy to the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.378" offset="7851526">That is an aggravation of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.414" offset="7863647">There is but one way effectively to insure the protection of the constitutional right of a criminal accused to be free from successive prosecution of the same offense, and that single way is to absolutely bar successive prosecution of the same offense, not to allow the prosecution to take place and force the accused to seek on direct appeal what this Court has said in Abney he is entitled to through an interlocutory appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.647" offset="8160607">This is different from the implied acquittal cases that we have in Price versus Georgia and Green versus United States in 1957, where the prosecutor there is seeking but that one conviction he feels the State entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.288" offset="8215151">Here the prosecutor has got that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.157" offset="8226644">They got it when the defendant pled guilty to robbery and burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.994" offset="8249946">Now the prosecutors are seeking another conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.762" offset="8261022">I don't begrudge them the right to do that, but they should do it consistent with the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.016" offset="8286099">Let them seek a second conviction if they feel that it's warranted, but let them indict him and let them prosecute him on a charge of aggravated murder by prior calculation and design, which is not jeopardy barred, or let them charge him with murder which is not jeopardy barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.895" offset="8357570">But, when they charge him with felony murder, that is a barred offense, and I suggest that the prosecutors realized what they had done wrong in this case after the guilty pleas had been entered and after Mathews made a statement admitting involvement in the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.124" offset="8434475">At that point they wanted to prosecute him for murder and realized that they had foreclosed felony murder prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.647" offset="8472613">Having foreclosed felony murder prosecution, they could only proceed with the other offenses and they knew that under the circumstances of this case, because of the controversial things which had happened at the scene and because of the evidentiary problems with this case, they couldn't prove the prior calculation and design beyond a reasonable doubt and they couldn't prove straight murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.113" offset="8562475">They had to reach back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.996" offset="8569998">They had to admit before this jury evidence of bad character which was generated by admitting evidence of what happened during the course of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.587" offset="8620362">That bad character evidence is designed by the rules of evidence to be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.491" offset="8643977">That evidence requires before it is admitted, a balancing test be conducted by the trial court, which was not conducted here because robbery was an element of the offense, improper but an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.067" offset="8694341">That evidence, if admitted, comes in under cautionary instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.119" offset="8714507">It comes in under limiting instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.321" offset="8723284">That was not done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.029" offset="8774171">That right of the accused is lost here because the trial court never made the decision, because any such evidentiary decision was foreclosed when that court improperly allowed the trial to proceed on the basis of a jeopardy-barred charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.406" offset="8843657">Those are the interests lost by the accused when a double jeopardy violation is allowed to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.298" offset="8887229">At the heart of the clause is his interest in avoiding successive prosecutions of the same offense, because multiple punishments need not be a primary concern of his immediately if the only way that the State can get to the point at which it can impose multiple punishments for the same offense is through successive prosecutions, and I suggest that that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.429" offset="8983777">There is no such thing, I would suggest to the Court, as a fair trial on a jeopardy barred offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.404" offset="9035604">Any trial on a jeopardy barred offense is an unfair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.708" offset="9056816">That decision has been made by the incorporation of the clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.414" offset="9091715">It is a decision which this Court has said is based on grounds not open to judicial examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.752" offset="9129018">When they prosecuted him the second time on the same offense they violated his double jeopardy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.656" offset="9152633">That trial was inherently unfair to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.477" offset="9171964">And fairness in terms of evidentiary considerations is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.249" offset="9211043">I respectfully request, accordingly, of the Court that the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has ordered nothing more than the granting of the writ, be affirmed and that if this man is to be tried, if this man is to be prosecuted on a murder offense, that that prosecution take place consistent with the rights protected by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.872" offset="9353462">I simply wish to emphasize as this Court has ofttimes stated that the remedy should be commensurate with the scope of the perceived violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.897" offset="9405603">Here the State of Ohio has forever lost the enhanced penalty which it initially obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.467" offset="9427859">Neither in his brief nor in his argument before this Court has the Respondent articulated one concrete piece of testimony or physical evidence which came in at the trial which would not have come in on a trial for simple murder, and for that matter will not come in, if there is a trial for simple murder, and yet a third prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.083" offset="9514377">What the Respondent endeavors to do here is simply punish the Government for making a mistake in a very unsettled area of constitutional jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.553" offset="9548231">His supposed remedy subjects both the Respondent and the prosecution to yet a third trial proceeding to no useful end whatsoever.</text>
