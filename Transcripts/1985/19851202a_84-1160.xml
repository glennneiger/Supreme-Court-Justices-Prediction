            <text syncTime="1443.350" offset="5908645">Before proceeding into the argument, I think it would be well to clarify several points that were raised on the petitioner's argument, especially with regard to some of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.824" offset="5950545">The record before the Court does indicate that Deputy Webb testified that there had been other instances where the third party premises had been searched in effectuating an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.048" offset="6003417">However, the record also reflects that Webb testified that he had never had to use force before because he had never been denied entry before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.904" offset="6038839">When he had the arrest warrant for someone, the person who owned the premises let him in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.956" offset="6059006">Also, in response to a question from Justice Marshall, petitioner indicated that the police had talked to the prosecutor before they went to get the fire ax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.394" offset="6096831">That in fact is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.463" offset="6105086">The police department, the Cincinnati police department never did talk to the prosecuting attorney in Hamilton County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.833" offset="6130581">It was a deputy sheriff who contacted his supervisor, who in turn connected the deputy sheriff to the prosecutor's office, and the deputy sheriff first talked to an assistant prosecuting attorney who went in and talked to the prosecuting attorney, and the message was relayed back to the deputy sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.914" offset="6210829">One other matter, and this is a minor matter, but or Page 3 in Footnote 4 of the petitioner's reply brief he indicates that the respondents have changed their argument from the Court of Appeals in that in the Court of Appeals we were not arguing that it was not a policy of Hamilton County which caused the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.993" offset="6295152">I believe that the statement that is in the footnote in the petitioner's reply brief is actually taken out of context to the entire paragraph in our brief before the Court of Appeals, and we have not changed our position in this matter.</text>
