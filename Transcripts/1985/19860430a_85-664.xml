            <text syncTime="487.692" offset="2097735">First, the FDA's construction of the Act is eminently rational and entirely plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.096" offset="2119364">It is consistent with the text and overall structure of the Act, with the legislative history, and the '38 Act and subsequent amendments, and with the policies that Congress sought to implement through the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="504.953" offset="2166803">The construction goes back at least to 1940, when in a published letter that was sent to certain private parties the agency made clear its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.009" offset="2202956">That letter is reprinted in a footnote to our brief at Page 17, Note 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.067" offset="2243185">The agency's construction has been consistent throughout this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.071" offset="2267217">It has never construed the Act as requiring it to adopt tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.840" offset="2278293">It has always construed it as the authorizing agency to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.709" offset="2289787">Second, the Court of Appeals upset the settled and successful administrative construction of a complex regulatory scheme largely by relying on one word in one clause in one section of a multipart statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.599" offset="2341405">By so doing, the Court of Appeals effectively misunderstood the function that Congress intended Section 406 to serve--</text>
            <text syncTime="556.472" offset="2372857">Third, Congress has been made aware of the agency's construction and the agency's regulatory position, and Congress has never criticized the agency for the practice it has followed, and in fact in 1954 Congress relied on the agency's views when Congress adopted an amendment to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.084" offset="2443283">Fourth, neither the Court of Appeals nor the respondents have offered a sound reason why Congress would have intended the regulatory process to be structured in an entirely different fashion or why it should be restructured in a new fashion at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.824" offset="2498244">In fact, as we explained, restructuring the process in the way the Court of Appeals and respondents suggest would not materially benefit the public, and would in fact pose substantial risks that the FDA would not be able to protect the public in the way that it has historically seen best.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.047" offset="2639201">No, the agency with the initial problem of dealing with pesticides adopted a pesticide tolerance in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.034" offset="2671071">In 1954, there was no longer any need to proceed under Section 406 because the pesticide amendment provided a new and speedier procedure to adopt tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.275" offset="2712031">The types of added contaminants with which we are concerned today are unavoidable contaminants that for the most paft were not discovered until beginning in the 1960s, when aflatoxin, for example, was discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.899" offset="2758528">The data about that is still coming in in a variety of different cases, but more importantly, the FDA has believed that on the one hand the benefits of having tolerances adopted in every case do not materially advance its ability to protect the public health, and on the other hand there is a substantial risk that once a tolerance is set, the agency might not be able to respond quickly in order to protect the public health if there are new developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.967" offset="2870855">The events that gave rise to this suit occurred in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.269" offset="2884021">In that year, the level of aflatoxin contamination in corn in three states, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, was unusually high.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.656" offset="2913591">Roughly 100 million bushels of corn valued at $319.5 million were affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.743" offset="2937937">Because of the size of the potential loss, and because the corn could be used in a way that would not injure the public health, the three states asked the FDA not to recommend an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.200" offset="2979733">The FDA agreed with the request as long as certain stringent conditions were met, one of which was that the food not be used for consumption by humans.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.240" offset="3015887">In a letter submitted to the FDA, respondents objected to the FDA's decision, and asked the FDA to rescind its decision in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.096" offset="3051309">After the FDA refused to alter its decision, respondent brought this suit In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.833" offset="3078267">On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the Secretary's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.904" offset="3098538">The three claims that the District Court addressed resulted in only one issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.474" offset="3124870">That issue is whether or not Section 406 requires the agency to adopt tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.211" offset="3147857">The District Court believed that when the statute is construed as a whole, Section 406 grants the agency the discretionary authority to adopt tolerances, but does not impose an obligation on the agency to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.102" offset="3195400">Now, the D.C. Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.054" offset="3207208">Relying entirely on the literal language of the statute, the Court of Appeals concluded that despite the agency's historic construction to the contrary, the Act required the agency to adopt tolerances in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.028" offset="3255064">The Court of Appeals found the legislative history unilluminative, and the purpose the that Court of Appeals gave for its reading of the statute, we believe, is narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.265" offset="3287978">Now, the central issue in this case is what function did Congress intend Section 406 to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.454" offset="3316817">When that function is understood, we believe that it becomes manifest that the agency's construction of the statute is correct, and that the agency has been correctly applying the Act for the nearly 50-year period it has been in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.012" offset="3366973">The pivotal provision in this regard is Section 406.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.397" offset="3380556">Section 406 was added in the 1938 Act, which was not the initial Act that was adopted to protect the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.237" offset="3411903">That was the 1906 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.355" offset="3420367">In the 1906 Act, adulterated food was not allowed to be shipped in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.991" offset="3442937">The only way the agency could establish that food was adulterated was by proving in an individual case that the presence of a contaminant in the food may render it injurious to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.381" offset="3484524">That was the precise holding that this Court handed down in the Lexington Mill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.268" offset="3504063">Now, that was a valuable construction of the statute for the agency, because the agency did not have to prove that it would necessarily injure the public in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.374" offset="3540426">But nonetheless, the agency believed that its enforcement powers could be enhanced by gaining the ability to adopt legislative rules that would allow it to set precise levels of contamination.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.099" offset="3587342">In the 1933 version of the Act which was drafted by the agency, the agency sought approval to adopt the legislative rules known as tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.871" offset="3626421">The agency did so because it believed that in some cases, the case-by-case method could be superseded by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.310" offset="3656200">And it also believed that by adopting legislative rules it could take into account the presence of contaminants in other foods in the environment as well as the food that was under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.516" offset="3697056">Throughout the entire course, throughout the entire five-year course of this legislation through Congress, no one ever suggested that the agency should be required to adopt tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.907" offset="3746584">In fact, the initial bill that the agency drafted and submitted to Congress that is now found in contained the same word, 406, but the agency construed the statute as being discretionary, not mandatory.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="1660.572" offset="6789222">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case raises important public policy issues concerning the process to be used by the Food and Drug Administration in setting a standard for poisonous and deleterious substances which are unavoidable and which are added.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.938" offset="6882741">And before I proceed I would like to say I agree with you, Justice O'Connor, that it is not immediately apparent that aflatoxin would be added, but it is very clear in the legislative history that Congres intended to cover substances added by nature as well as those added by man, and the FDA, as Mr. Larkin said, consistently construed that word in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.488" offset="6980961">For example, the legislative history talks about lead, which can get into the environment, and describes that as an added substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.726" offset="7005830">The substances that we are concerned with here are substances such as mercury in fish and aflatoxin in corn, the specific substance around which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.467" offset="7056821">And I would like to begin by responding to Justice White's question, which is, why would Congress have wanted to intend, wished to intend that FDA use the public participation and rulemaking processes in regulating these added poisonous and deleterious substances?</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.530" offset="7141039">And to start, I would like to talk for a few minutes, one minute about what decision it is that the FDA is going to have to make when it is regulating aflatoxin or another one of these substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.623" offset="7201435">Essentially it is a two-part decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.759" offset="7210003">In the first instance it will have to look at the evidence and determine how dangerous is that substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.746" offset="7237902">The parties here agree that aflatoxin is an extremely potent carcinogen, but obviously one of the issues that the agency would have to look at is exactly how potent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.471" offset="7280847">The second issue is how avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.756" offset="7294013">Aflatoxin occurs in a mold that grows on corn, but the mold can be controlled by dampness or other storage conditions, and so the agency would want to look obviously and see whether there were ways to limit the public exposure to the substance, and regardless of whether the FDA uses the action levels which it chooses to use or the rulemaking procedure we are advocating, it is going to have to decide each of these two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.792" offset="7422117">The difference is that public participation would require the agency to do several things that we regard as advantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.548" offset="7457121">First, it would have to marshall the evidence and inform the public of what evidence it is relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.452" offset="7480736">Secondly, it would have to allow the submission of additional evidence by either consumers or by industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.308" offset="7508217">Third, it would have to hold a hearing if someone requested a hearing and if there were material issues of fact, and fourth, it would have to explain the reasons for its decision and put this together in a record which would be subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.936" offset="7582718">The advantages of such a system are that it disciplines the agency in its thought process, it allows for more information, and it enhances the agency's credibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.590" offset="7717301">The issue is whether in Section 406 Congress mandated public participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.042" offset="7739139">And if I may, what I would like to do before I get to the issue is spend a few minutes talking about action levels, which are the way, the device that the agency uses now to regulate these substances, so we can see the contrast between what the agency does and what we contend Congress required it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.824" offset="7826284">The FDA's use of action levels, and, we would contend, the disadvantages of not allowing public Participation can be seen in the way the agency regulates aflatoxin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.667" offset="7889604">In 1969, it set the action level for aflatoxin at 20 parts per billion, and it did that simply by issuing a press release announcing it to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.558" offset="7937147">It gave no explanation of its reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.875" offset="7946447">It created no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.527" offset="7957105">It provided no opportunity to comment, and it provided the public with no way of determining whether the agency had done a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.132" offset="7995453">Three times in recent years the FDA has granted exceptions to those action levels of a temporary nature, and at most what the FDA has done to provide for public comment is after the fact publish its decision in the Federal Register and invite comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.962" offset="8074760">In 1983, the Community Nutrition Institute did indeed comment, but the FDA never even responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.802" offset="8102137">It is our contention that these action levels in most respects operate like a tolerance even though they are not promulgated through the tolerance setting procedures, and they do that because we would contend they act really as a license to the industry, and they are the FDA's approval of corn, for example, as long as it contains less than 20 parts per billion aflatoxin, and I would like to take a moment and cite a couple of the places in the record to demonstrate this, because it has just recently become an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.075" offset="8255214">The first place is in the answer to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.129" offset="8267439">The complaint in Paragraph 13 on Page 110 of the joint appendix alleges FDA has set an informal action level which is an administrative determination without notice and comment rulemaking as to the level of aflatoxin Contamination below which no regulatory action will be taken against the product, and the agency admitted that contention in its answer at Page 125.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.148" offset="8391573">In addition, each of the times the FDA has granted these exemptions, at Page 104, 118, and 227 of the joint appendix, it has said something like it said in 1983 or similar language, and that language is, the FDA will not object to the shipment of corn containing between 20 parts per billion and 100 parts per billion aflatoxin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.131" offset="8495436">That is on Page 227 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.833" offset="8506303">Additional authorities are cited at Pages 8 and 9 of our brief, and I guess the final authority would be the FDA's actual practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.955" offset="8546741">It has never prosecuted a company who has complied with one of its action levels, and at least in my mind it is hard to believe such a prosecution could be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.996" offset="8590940">I would like to now turn to the statute, because I regard the key flaw in the government's argument to be the fact that it simply doesn't talk about the actual language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.374" offset="8660426">Section 406, which is the statutory provision at issue, covers a substance which meets a three-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.414" offset="8700654">It must be poisonous and deleterious; it must be added; and it must be unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.718" offset="8725836">There is no doubt that aflatoxin qualifies under all three of those parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.888" offset="8750496">And so the issue turns around later language of the statute which says in Section 406,</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.827" offset="8786231">"If such substance is unavoidable, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.083" offset="8815279">Now, there is other language in the statute that the government relies on, and I would like to talk about that in a minute, but for the moment I would like to focus on the words, "the Secretary shall promulgate regulations".</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.391" offset="8860524">It is clear under the statutory scheme that if the statute requires the Secretary to promulgate those regulations, they must be issued in compliance with the rulemaking procedures contained in Section 701(e) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.733" offset="8921859">And we regard at least this language taken by itself as dispositive of Congress's intent and as dispositive of the issue as to whether the Secretary is indeed required to issue those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.660" offset="8985598">The agency relies on language which appears later in the statute to argue that the Secretary has discretion as to whether... to use Section 406, and that language is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.420" offset="9044635">The statute says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.203" offset="9047769">"The Secretary shall promulgate regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent as he finds necessary for the protection of the public health. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.643" offset="9093536">"The agency says the words. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.710" offset="9101791">to such extent as he finds necessary for the protection of the public health "modifies the word" shall,</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.564" offset="9125196">"and that the Secretary need only use Section 406 when he deems it necessary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.701" offset="9145781">As the Court of Appeals explained in its opinion, probably better than I can, the problem with this argument is that it is not consistent with the structure of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.843" offset="9186323">The better reading of the sentence is that the words were intended to describe the standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3494.657" offset="14125555">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.609" offset="14129422">I have a few points I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.559" offset="14137154">First, we have heard a great deal about public participation being the purpose that the Act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.179" offset="14159724">As a factual matter, I would like to point out that the FDA will receive comments from parties either asking to have tolerances or action levels set or changed, and therefore if respondents want to have some input in the process they need only apply to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.789" offset="14218133">But I think more importantly, since the question is what Congress intended in 1938, and since the legislative history makes crystal clear that the public Congress was concerned with were the people who produce food at that point, I don't think respondents can reasonably expect to place a contemporary construction on a rather old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.936" offset="14294724">Secondly, respondents argue that action levels are the equivalent of a license to add contaminants to food or to market contaminated food, and that is just flat wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.708" offset="14337774">Action levels are informal prosecutorial guidelines, and tolerances are regulations having the force and effect of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.731" offset="14373928">The two are materially different, and respondents have attempted to equate the two throughout this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.735" offset="14397856">I would also like to point out that as we explained at Page 45, Note 45 of our brief, it is not that easy to change tolerances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.157" offset="14427635">Once we tried to change the PCB tolerance in food, we found out it took seven years to do it, it can't be done as easily as changing an action level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.679" offset="14461699">The agency in '74, when there was PPB contamination, changed its action level in a relatively brief period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.500" offset="14488971">Changing a tolerance in order to respond to an emergency takes a drastically longer period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.552" offset="14509137">I would also like to say that respondents have attempted to prepare the regulatory scheme here to the regulatory scheme for color additives, food additives, and drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.741" offset="14545918">The schemes are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.426" offset="14552710">If you want to market a food with a food additive, you have to prove that it is safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.795" offset="14570159">Here the agency has to prove that the contaminant will result in some injury to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.365" offset="14592416">The burden of proof is in an entirely different place in the two different types of postures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.185" offset="14611746">And finally, I would also like to point out that agency action levels... excuse me... agency action levels are published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.006" offset="14639018">They have been since the agency's regulations were adopted in 1977, so anyone can learn where they are, and the last point is that we don't ask the Court to say that the House amendment to the bill had no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.783" offset="14694084">All you have to do is read the House report, and you can see that the House stated quite clearly that it didn't intend this change to have any substantive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.622" offset="14725431">The House reported stated that it authorized the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.740" offset="14737970">It also stated that in all of the other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.442" offset="14748733">Thank you very much.</text>
