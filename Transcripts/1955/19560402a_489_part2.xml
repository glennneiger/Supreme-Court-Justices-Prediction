            <text syncTime="19.786" offset="79099">The order is in the same form.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.968" offset="91847">Now, I do not think that this order shows a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.343" offset="117342">All it does is to say that he has failed to show probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.882" offset="135523">Supreme Court of Florida takes judicial notice of its own record.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.685" offset="150674">It said that time and again and that -- and then the cases where they -- it shows the application of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.222" offset="184842">Now, Supreme Court of Florida, in the present case here, if this order is quite consistent with the disposition on the part of that Court, knowing as we do, judicially, that Durley, (Inaudible) record, that he has raised the same federal question in 1952 that he now seeks to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.179" offset="300617">He hasn't, in truth and in fact, shown probable cause showing it's illegal, was detained because we know that that's barred as a matter of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.527" offset="342100">Or they could have said, if they thought that there was no res judicata, if they thought that the federal question had not been raised in 1952, they could have said themselves, why we know, as a matter of judicial knowledge, that he had a fair and adequate opportunity in 1952 to raise this question and since he did have, nothing he says here, shows any probable cause to -- to think he ought to be turned out</text>

            <text syncTime="122.836" offset="491311">I checked it with the clerk over the telephone sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.906" offset="507611">They've been using that standard form of order and a denial for many years with exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.243" offset="528927">I'll grant you that at times --</text>

            <label>Mr. Bowen</label>
            <text syncTime="134.267" offset="536973">-- like Irvin against Chapman and -- and Washington against Mayo, in State ex rel.Johnson against Mayo, they had also filed an order to enunciate some principle that they think they ought to take time out from their -- from their busy labors for writing opinion about and they will deviate from that rule when they want to write an opinion but all -- in all other cases, this is the form of order that is used regardless of what I urge as a reason for denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.977" offset="659853">So, there's nothing about the form of this order that says the -- they considered the thing on the merits because he certainly had not shown any reason to think he'd been illegally detained if everything he said was barred by -- and judicially known to them to be barred either by the doctrine of res judicata or by the other doctrine that he had a fair and adequate opportunity to raise it before and didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.821" offset="767269">Now, he didn't attempt to bring himself, in this case, to decide in 1955 down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.590" offset="802273">He didn't attempt to make the slightest excuse for not having raised the question in 1952, if, in fact, he thought he had not raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.050" offset="836127">I submit that he did raise the federal question in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.451" offset="849711">But if he had thought that he did not raise it, he made no effort to bring himself under the Johnson case by giving an excuse for not having raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.122" offset="888477">Presumably, he had a fair and adequate opportunity because he had counsel and knew everything then that he knows now.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.678" offset="918674">To get on to the merits of the proposition of double jeopardy or double punishment, I point out that in each case, the trial court judged Durley to be guilty of the offense charged in each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.239" offset="996937">There were three counts in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.834" offset="1007282">In case number 4179 it would best but nonetheless, the first or when he gets the first sentences in.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.968" offset="1035807">The judge sentenced him for your offense charged in the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.940" offset="1067677">Then he sentenced him for your said offense charged in the second count to run consecutively with the sentence under the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.848" offset="1111353">Under the third count, he said, for -- for your said offense charged in the third count.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.099" offset="1148343">And sentenced -- and made that sentence run consecutively to the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.356" offset="1169345">He did that over -- he did that in number 4172, also.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.994" offset="1191915">And I submit to the Court that under the circumstances, that was a finding by the trial court that there were, in truth and in fact, three separate crimes charged in each information.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.594" offset="1250325">Now, under the law of Florida, it is quite possible that under some circumstances quite permissible to allege several separate and distinct crimes in several counts of an information.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.430" offset="1305704">For example, the (Inaudible) case that came up from Tampa charged four separate and distinct acts of receiving stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.527" offset="1346038">They were days apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.840" offset="1355337">The information showed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.367" offset="1361398">Each of the -- the several counts showed that there were days and sometimes weeks apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.584" offset="1378325">And yet, the Supreme Court of Florida held that -- that under the circumstances, that was quite proper to not only charge it that way but to convict him on each count and to sentence him on each count to run consecutively because they were actually four different crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.688" offset="1462648">Now, the law of Florida on larceny is as Mr. Rutledge just stated it to you --</text>

            <text syncTime="423.295" offset="1693153">-- that when he judged him guilty of three separate crimes in each case and sentenced him for three separate crimes, that that's conclusive and binding on the one except perhaps on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.469" offset="1741845">On direct appeal, if the evidence had gone to Supreme Court of Florida and if the evidence had actually shown that that wasn't the case, that -- that there actually was only one crime, they would have reversed as they did in the Hearn case that Mr. Rutledge had cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.227" offset="1800882">Now, the Hearn case is authority for -- for the -- for the proposition that where several things, animals or what not are stolen from the same owner at the same time and place and under the same circumstances that's one larceny and not more than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.571" offset="1882279">But, the Hearn case also recognized that if -- it's a different time or different places or under different circumstances that it's immaterial whether it's from the same owner or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.877" offset="1955422">They didn't say it in -- in these words but the case stands for this proposition that it's immaterial that it's on the same date.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.681" offset="1982694">And so, with that being the law of Florida and with the trial judge having heard the evidence and presumably knowing what the law of Florida was, and when he then find adjudged him guilty of and sentenced him for six offenses, I submit that that is sufficient to withstand collateral attacks anywhere on these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.808" offset="2283207">I'll give an illustration of why I say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.668" offset="2518622">After he had served one year, he applied to Supreme Court of Florida for habeas corpus and that Court held and properly so that desertion comprehends with it the nonsupport, the failure to support his child and that since he had been sentenced under the first count which embraced everything that was in the second count as -- as minor -- as a lesser ingredient or as -- as if included part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.403" offset="2653518">And -- and he didn't have to serve one year because one year was the maximum provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.419" offset="2677656">That was the decision by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.433" offset="2685701">And I'm inclined to believe that if there were no other impediment -- if there were no impediment in its way on procedural grounds, that if he, who admitted the fact that he had been sentenced more than -- to more than one sentence for the same offense that -- that he would be heard and he would be cut loose from another sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.546" offset="11030152">The judge does charge the jury to examine such testimony with care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.880" offset="11051468">I should also, on the jurisdictional point, like to refer this Court to the Williams versus Georgia case which was decided, I believe, in the last term which stated, as I understand it, that a State may be freed to lay down a rule that you cannot raise your federal question except to the particular point and that a state procedural rule which forbids raising the federal question at late stages in the case or by any other than the prescribed method has been recognized as a valid exercise of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.918" offset="11211651">But the Court went on in that case, as I understand it, to say that where the State does allow such matters in the Court's discretion, but then the U.S.Supreme Court, this Court may review the operation of such discretion, otherwise, it loses power over its own jurisdiction, and I submit that that certainly is precisely this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.907" offset="11307572">The case has shown the Florida Supreme Court certainly -- we contend first of all, if it had any discretion in this case at all, certainly, exercised that discretion in ruling on the merits of this petition, and in any event, it has a discretion as shown by this decision, Florida decisions and that discretion, the use of that discretion is subject to review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.557" offset="11418227">I should like to also point out that in regard to the point of habeas corpus line to -- but General Bowen refers to impeach the record and I would like to refer in that regard to the Shoemaker case, Shoemaker versus Mayo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.427" offset="11497639">In that case, a man had pleaded guilty for the charge and he was permitted by habeas corpus to come in and challenge the -- the plea on the record by claiming that at the time he made that plea, he was under the influence of -- of a narcotic drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.887" offset="11563468">In short, he was able to go in and challenge that plea by the means of habeas corpus, and indeed, this Court, in a very recent case, Chandler versus Fretag had before it, the very same situation in which General Bowen mentioned of the record in that case came from Tennessee, specifically stated that counsel was present but petitioner in that case was permitted by witnesses to come in and show the contrary, the exact contrary that he had no counsel and indeed after he had made in pursuance of showing by witnesses, the State conceded the error in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.842" offset="11735353">I should also like to point out finally, in regard to this res judicata point, that the (Inaudible) affidavit - the affidavit which states that these - the evidentiary point, in other words, the condition of the record that the testimony of these two accomplices show that these cattle were all taken at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.397" offset="11817587">That affidavit was never attached to any prior petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.247" offset="11832947">It was -- the affidavit was made in 1955, I believe, and it was attached only to this last petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.605" offset="11862413">And indeed, we submitted that if you examine the 1952 petition, it will show on its face that it challenges only the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.370" offset="11929391">It states in paragraph 2 and paragraph 5 or section - Article 2 or Article 5 of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.687" offset="11970664">It state that the counts and I'm quoting now, “Do in fact charge the one and the same crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.143" offset="11996473">And again paragraph 5, "That the two informations aforesaid do make out for two crimes."</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.770" offset="12019043">In other words, the whole thrust of that petition was at the face of the informations, not at what the testimony produced.</text>
