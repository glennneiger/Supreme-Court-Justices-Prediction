        <section startTime="0" stopTime="2431.674">
          <heading>Argument of Frank E. Holman</heading>
          <turn speaker="frank_e_holman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="632.041">
            <label>Mr. Frank E. Holman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">A brief reference perhaps should be made which come under this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.080" offset="40229">Section 1 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act as you all know deals with the matter of reasonable rates in fares and charges and requires every common carrier to furnish transportation on reasonable request and to establish such just reasonable rates, fares and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.497" offset="129985">Now, 1 (5) which is somewhat complimentary to that merely declares that unjust and unreasonable charges were in part, there over prohibited, which were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.294" offset="193097">Section 1 (3) or rather 3 (1) of the Act is what we call the provision with respect to discrimination, as if we pointed out that that is discrimination as between shippers in localities, and not between carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.347" offset="265300">Over Section 3 (4) deals with the matter of discrimination as between carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.875" offset="295497">This Section, 3 (4) requires carriers to afford reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between respective lines and connecting lines and forbids them to discriminate between their respective lines and connecting lines and rates and fares and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.048" offset="380134">Section 15 of the Act is sometimes said in a general way to implement these other provisions since the other provisions are merely declarations of law, 15 empowers -- 15 (1) empowers the Commission to prescribe just and reasonable railroad rates, fares and charges, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.786" offset="483056">And 15 (3), by way of further implementation authorizes and requires the Commission on average deem necessary and desirable in the public interest to establish through routes and joint rates, fares and charges so much with the statute or the statutory background.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.698" offset="578769">You're all, of course, familiar with definition, what had occurred to me, we might as well bring them out and then I will proceed to the factual statement as such that through route as merely an arrangement expressed or implied or established by the Commission between connecting railroads for the continuous carriage of goods from one originating point to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.470" offset="693812">A through rate so-called, is a general term that applies in a general way to any through carriage of goods or one type of a through rate is a joint rate, which is ordinarily lower than a combination rate or a combination of locals as it's called.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.284" offset="793078">A competitive joint rate is a type of joint rate which is identical as between common points of origin and common points of destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.964" offset="847830">That's of some importance here if I may turn to this map which one of my associate said that succeeded in shutting my clients off from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.566" offset="886178">For example at this point here, Portland, by the way this map is an enlargement of the map, Exhibit C, in the brief and it's supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.418" offset="929646">The Southern Pacific, for example, will take a shipment coming down on this long route and going to St. Louis at the same competitive joint rates with the Union Pacific will take it and carry it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.137" offset="984503">Well, the competitive rate is a rate that's identical from an identical point of origin on a through route, to an identical point of destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.951" offset="1027762">A fuller and I think the best exposition to this mode of rates and charges and so on as found in Mr. Brandeis' -- Mr. Justice Brandies' note, note 4 in St. Louis in Southwestern Railway versus United States, 245 U.S. at 139.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.860" offset="1111353">Now, as I have indicated, these appeals arise out of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.837" offset="1143327">All the issues stemmed from that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.818" offset="1167256">We believe that the issues maybe best clarified by propounding certain factual inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.265" offset="1209051">First, what was the situation, the factual situation which caused the Rio Grande to file its complaint before the Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.845" offset="1247295">Two, what relief did that complaint seek?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.762" offset="1258998">Three, what relief did the Commission grant?</text>
            <text syncTime="318.008" offset="1271954">Four, what is the position of the parties in this Court with respect to the action of the two United States District Courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.775" offset="1311033">Now, as to the first inquiry, the situation which caused the Rio Grande to file its complaint, turning to the map, we have shown the routes of the Union Pacific, not all of them because some of them are not of any particular important, but generally, the routes of the Union Pacific in red, and the Rio Grande in green.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.740" offset="1426913">The Rio Grande has 2400 miles of railway, extending generally between Ogden, Utah, Denver, Colorado, and other Colorado common points, Colorado Springs, Pueblo and Trinidad.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.951" offset="1495771">The Union Pacific has two Eastern terminals sometimes set with the Omaha but actually counted for us and then came Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.394" offset="1533492">The Union Pacific would be first in the line from Omaha in the State of Wyoming from its other terminals that proceeds to Denver then up and joins the line there and comes into Ogden, Utah which is what's called the “closed gateway” here.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.067" offset="1608202">It has a short -- got a branch running from (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="407.929" offset="1631713">When it reaches Ogden, we have suggested in the brief that it has two branches of a wye.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.395" offset="1669538">One branch of the wye comes down south through Utah and Southern Nevada and through the Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.764" offset="1702975">The other branch of wye goes up here to the northwest and then there is branch also to Butte, Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.223" offset="1748846">These are the crucial points in the sense in connection with the gateway situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.603" offset="1790328">Now, at various points in the brief, there is something of a change terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.884" offset="1827527">For example, in certain places in the Commission order, this area north of Ogden was called “excluded area.”</text>
            <text syncTime="465.916" offset="1863576">It's the area in which the Union Pacific declined to accord joint competitive rates coming down to Ogden, going over the Rio Grande and going south and east.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.929" offset="1911641">In some places, it's called the northwest area.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.869" offset="1927419">In other places, it's called the “closed door” territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.844" offset="1943301">Those terms are interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.969" offset="1951869">We call it the “closed door territory”, it's the Ogden Gateway that follow it and that area is close to the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.436" offset="1985724">Now, Rio Grande is connected at Denver with four railroads, the Rock Island, the Burlington, Sante Fe and the Colorado Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.905" offset="2031595">At Colorado Springs with the Burlington, Sante Fe, Colorado Southern, at (Inaudible) with the Sante Fe and the Missouri Pacific and the Colorado Southern and Trinidad with the Sante Fe and the Colorado Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.179" offset="2092617">In other words, the Rio Grande is not a detached railroad situated by itself in the center of the continent.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.442" offset="2133682">It is connected up here with all the main lines from two traffics and here, it has its connection with the Western Pacific, out at Salt Lake through the coast and at Ogden with the Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.689" offset="2194704">So that in a general way is the factual situation with respect to the location of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.617" offset="2230439">That is the two main railroads that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.614" offset="2246426">The other railroads are in black and certain routes have been designated which I'll call to your attention in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.022" offset="2284042">Now, as we put it and we put it without any intention of being rhetorical, We say that this “closed door” territory in here is maintained, it's a kind of a Union Pacific monopoly as that a kind of principality in which they undertake to say to various connecting roads whether they will entertain traffic on through routes with joint competitive rates or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.934" offset="2411729">When -- since they do entertain traffic up here, generally speaking from Huntington in here with the Northern Transcontinental, they do entertain here, go over the shipment, may go over route number nine and way down here and into St. Louis at a joint competitive rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.254" offset="2496993">But it may not come down through Ogden all over the Rio Grande and going to St. Louis at a joint competitive rates or a competitive (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="641.441" offset="2565747">Now, we've indicated several routes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.526" offset="2582047">Route one is the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.659" offset="2594586">The Union Pacific, of course, from many points in this area, coming through (Inaudible) where it's cutoff, and what breaks down in Denver, on a little shorter milage from ourselves, put it in to Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.625" offset="2654459">But the second shortest route of all these routes in which they short route themselves, that that short route is the Rio Grande with reference to the first route, the Union Pacific coming through here where the shortest route is in 2167 miles to St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.046" offset="2752157">Often, they don't come by that route as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.486" offset="2765845">They come down to Ogden and come through it but giving them credit for that, that route is 2232 miles from this Portland area through St. Louis or it's 3% longer than their shortest route.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.757" offset="2838988">Now, the Rio Grande comes and our route is only 9% longer than the shortest of the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.058" offset="2880157">These others range up to 45 where the shipment coming down here from North Portland coming down route number nine, through -- pass up to Santa Rosa, goes to St. Louis at a competitive joint rate on a through route, but a shipment may not come down through this way and over the Rio Grande at a competitive joint rate and a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.491" offset="2973884">So that the -- without taking the turns, with all those routes, this map and it's the same map which you have in the brief indicates this mileage of differentials and the other railroads with whom the Union Pacific was short-haul itself, but we're not sure it's all itself with the Rio Grande.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.720" offset="3122782">The Union Pacific accords us a through route and a joint competitive rate from the Los Angeles area through the Salt Lake and the Provo Gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.802" offset="3167190">In other words, shippers of fruit, then cattle and livestock and so on, who want to use the Rio Grande to get into this area, have a through route and a competitive joint rate over the Rio Grande in this area, but this area they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.927" offset="3235631">And one of our contention is that under the statute that gives a preference to these growers down in California and Nevada, if I may say so, over the shippers and growers in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.691" offset="3566759">Now then, as to the relief sought by the Rio Grande, the Rio Grande and its complaint before the Commission alleged that through routes are already in existence, as a matter of fact and a matter of law through this Ogden Gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.785" offset="3655053">Originally, through routes and competitive joint rates were in existence when the Oregon Short Line Railway operated this line across Huntington up to Butte and the Oregon Western Railroad and Navigation operated the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.970" offset="3731853">In other words, there is no dispute in this record that in 1897 and from then on through routes existed and competitive joint rates existed over these lines that we are now talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.144" offset="3808549">What the Union Pacific says that when they took control of those lines, beginning in 1906, they reacquired the Oregon Short Line and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation that -- then they cancelled the competitive joint rates and that everybody should have known that they meant by that to cancel the competitive through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.861" offset="3927353">We take the position fundamentally and that's why in our brief on here, we argue first what's called the Colorado case because that case held that the Commission erred as a matter of law in failing to hold the through routes were in existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.461" offset="4197773">Through routes and competitive joint rates were granted by the Commission on certain commodities under the authority they had in 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.220" offset="4232777">So, it does necessarily follow as some of our interveners contend if you'll examine their briefs does necessarily follow that they want to give up on those particular commodities, livestock for example, and have it all sent back to the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.684" offset="4478642">Now, there's a cross-hatched map which is also a map that's in the record and you will note that there is an area that's cross-hatched covering parts of Eastern Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wisconsin and running down southerly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.315" offset="4573205">I never could understand quite why it projected down southerly into what might we called Rio Grande territory, but it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.079" offset="4604238">Now, in order -- because they were operating under the restrictions of 15 (4), the Commission felt that there was a right under that that the Union Pacific should be protected on its long-haul, at least so far as - was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.347" offset="4673306">So, under the Commission order now on these eight or 10 commodities that are listed, the Commission gave us through route and competitive joint rate out of this closed door territory, coming down here but not to Denver, not the Colorado Springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.230" offset="4776856">You'll notice that little line on the cross-hatch, that Colorado going south from Denver, leaves Denver in these points in the cross-hatched territory, that's forbidden territory to us under the Commission order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.159" offset="4848536">So, that we control the short-haul ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.699" offset="4858776">We pick up freight here in this area within the Rio Grande territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.510" offset="4878002">We can't ship it over our line and have it go in there under the Commission order, but we have to deliver it at Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.122" offset="4904438">In other words, the one effect of the Commission order is that we're compelled to short-haul ourselves on our end in order to preserve their long-haul so that the Commission order doesn't give us competitive joint rates and the through routes to any of those Colorado common points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.664" offset="4990642">Also, if you'll note, we have to ship through this designated area and on some -- to some points South and East in order to get these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.111" offset="5044349">So, without going into that farther, I did want to call your attention to the fact that this order protects the Union Pacific under 15 (4) to the farthest extent of its long-haul, clear through on its lands to Denver, Omaha and so on except that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.741" offset="5122926">Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha since they are also focal points or gateways, we'd have to go through those to get a shipment down to Springfield, Illinois so, if we have a through shipment, we can go into Omaha and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.507" offset="5202024">But we can't operate within our own territory here, Colorado common point, we have to short-haul ourselves under this order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.016" offset="8251977">Well, that's -- that's covered at considerable length that Mr. Hickey's brief at pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.141" offset="8280503">You'd turn to Mr. Hickey's brief at page 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.293" offset="8293146">You'll find that whole problem discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.714" offset="8306834">Our -- our resume of it is merely this that if when a railroad cancels competitive joint rates over through routes at which is also to close the through routes, it could do so legally and factually by simply publishing in its tariffs that it will not thereafter issue a through bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.920" offset="8375589">It can issue a local bill of lading or accept shipments which are routed by shippers over the previous existing through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.965" offset="8407771">The Union Pacific failed to take this significant and essential step for effectually closing the through routes over the Rio Grande via the Ogden Gateway and the -- yes, that's the brief, Mr. Hickey's brief, 9 and 10, that's in here pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.730" offset="8478824">So, we -- to summarize, take the position that the Colorado court was correct when it found on the undisputed evidence in the case that these through routes have never been cancelled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.436" offset="8549669">Well, that would be enough if that is the fact, but also, if shippers had been using them as through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.292" offset="8593136">That's another established one of through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.003" offset="8604003">I haven't time for the moment to refer to that evidence, what -- the evidence is in the brief as to the actual use of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.263" offset="8637022">Now, so much for that, the next point in the Colorado decision is the judgment to the effect that the error of the Commission in this regard or assuming that it's -- it's a legal error, not administrative finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.209" offset="8744751">The evidence was undisputed, counsel on cross-examination by Chairman Aldrich submitted the through routes were in existence but they merely have to pay a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.220" offset="8796787">The chief traffic witness of the Union Pacific, Mr. (Inaudible) admits that through routes were in existence, but they had to pay a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.402" offset="8833567">But then they said a through route maybe closed commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.181" offset="8852689">If you have the economic deterrent, that closes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.725" offset="8866900">All the evidence showed that some people want to use the Rio Grande badly enough that they went ahead and shipped anyway even at the higher rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.880" offset="8959478">Union Pacific contends strongly that the Commission wouldn't do anything more about this if it went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.178" offset="8984660">Well, we don't know of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.556" offset="8990198">We can't prejudge what the Commission would do, free to this limitation, but in all events, you have situations like this which are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.845" offset="9027291">Certainly, when the Commission in order to preserved the long-haul under 15 (4) through the line and west side of Denver, and will not give at a through route to Denver, if they're reconsidering it without the limitations of 15 (4), would be rather ridiculous not to give us a through route to the Colorado common points into our own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.119" offset="9116421">So, if one had time, there are many situations in this picture whereby the Commission except as Judge Phillips solved to the self imposed limitation would have a freedom of action where they could have taken a different view of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.106" offset="9196356">Now, I'm sorry I have hardly reached the -- I haven't reached the Nebraska case, the Government will be most interested in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.638" offset="9238465">I do want to get to this view before you however, as to the Nebraska case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.837" offset="9259259">I did make an analysis, a careful analysis of the Commission opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.270" offset="9280993">It's very long, somewhat involved, what those are, but I think that findings are substantial, that the findings support the conclusions and that the evidence supports the findings and that there is evidence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.556" offset="9342224">The main thing and perhaps the only thing I have time for with respect to the Nebraska case is that it's inevitable on any view of the Nebraska case to come to any other conclusion, but that the Court substituted its administrative judgement for the administrative judgment of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.809" offset="9447236">An opinion was delivered here this morning which touched upon that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.958" offset="9463745">Because the only change they made was the same evidence and all that sort of thing, the only change they made was -- which still have the eight commodities, we still have the area, the open area beyond this restricted area what -- they reduced it by saying that the need, the public need and the public necessity was only for shipments out of this closed-door territory which went over the Rio Grande and required in-transit privileges which leaves the anomaly as I pointed out a moment ago, that if you're a shipper in the Idaho area and you want to ship potatoes through (Inaudible), you have to pay a higher rate if you use the Rio Grande and if you want to ship into Salt Lake City and have them unloaded and sorted and processed and despite of all that expense, the shipper who has in-transit privileges get a -- gets a cheaper rate on the shipper who ships right through.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.183" offset="9828728">You might say that in view of the shortness of time, I will discuss such points as I -- as I can and pray that the Court will consider the points on brief that I'm unable to discuss during the time that I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.577" offset="9922247">We have divided our time as I told the clerk of the Court and I presume the Chief Justice has the division between the Union Pacific Northern Railroad, the Attorney General of Colorado or rather of Washington and the Attorney General of Nebraska or their assistants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.391" offset="10013466">Now, if I could persuade Your Honors to forget the smog and confusion in which the Rio Grande has attempted to disguise it's case and let me tell you that the case as we see it and we think and appeal it in this area here which we cross-hatched in green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.090" offset="10136346">I hope Your Honors can see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.869" offset="10143451">In fact, if there's a doubt in which we could, but it's what's called the Northwest area or as they choose to call it “closed door” area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.615" offset="10178456">There is -- originate and terminate about 172,000 cargoes of freight a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.343" offset="10209280">It moves eastward, it points in eastward, mostly east of the Missouri -- Mississippi River and North of the Ohio River and the westbound traffic originating mostly in that eastern area and a little bit in the south moves westward over the northern lines up here, the Great Northern Milwaukee and Northern Pacific are all in the Union Pacific routes which are shown on this map in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.388" offset="10321502">The Rio Grande route is shown between Ogden and Denver and the broken flat line and it is that 172,000 cars that move over these routes which the Commission found these as much as 50% shorter than routes or some routes that would be made over the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.069" offset="10428186">And actually, the movement over the Rio Grande from this point where we start east from Pocatello direct through Cheyenne, if the traffic was -- had to be moved down to Ogden and there given to the Rio Grande, it would take 219 more miles of transportation work to get it to Omaha and 199 more miles to get the same shipment to Omaha on its way to its ultimate destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.769" offset="10543020">You understand that that the traffic moved between the northwest area and the area east of the Mississippi River and all the Rio Grande ones is the substitute or part of its line for the lines on which the traffic originates and terminates and the president of the Rio Grand Railroad said it's -- it's sole purpose was to improve its financial position by taking a bridge haul out of this traffic that goes from the -- moves between the west coast and the east coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.143" offset="11052513">All through the Commission's report, there is emphasis, reemphasis and reiteration of the importance of bridge traffic to the Rio Grande Railroad and the recital of its bankrupt condition which finally -- which ended in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.990" offset="11135896">The -- the financial importance of bridge traffic to the Rio Grande runs all through the report until they get up to the final point of -- of discussion and trying to arrive at a decision, they point out that the Rio Grande increased it state of traffic from other routes for a bridge haul, 326% in the 15 years before it filed its complaint and the Rio Grande said that we can't live without taking money from or rather taking traffic in revenues from other carriers which we neither originate and -- or nor terminate and it's the traffic in which there's generally conceded to be the greatest amount of net money because you don't have the expensive gathering and delivering expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.585" offset="11682273">But when a railroad like the Rio Grande that has been bankrupt throughout most of its career, unfortunately, and has been trimming of its branch lines abandoning them in order to work as what it calls a bridge line and then comes to the Commission in its non early mercenary position and I -- I think we should consider the fact that it's out for the money and the only way to get it is from the carriers that originate and terminate the traffic and are hauling it between the termini of the existing through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.823" offset="11823229">You -- I don't think that you have in this case what you could easily imagine you would have in a case brought by shippers who wanted better transportation to result from the proposed through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.627" offset="11890416">You don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.440" offset="11897731">You have a situation in which the Rio Grande stood by and it finally build up its line, as its president testified through the period of -- of its last bankruptcy, until they reached the points, they said, “Well, now we think we can compete for this traffic so we'll try to cut in on it and we'll bring a complaint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.822" offset="11971187">They went out and as they admit, they solicited a lot of shippers to come and help them out to win the case and brought them in and Mr. Holman was speaking for them just now, so, he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.989" offset="12019879">So, the Rio Grande I think was cognizant of all these difficulties that stood in its way and tried to disguise its complaint or at least ride through the Commission on a public interest complaint, but its own financial interest and its financial gain cannot be forgotten.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.337" offset="12521326">Now, let's take it apart from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.469" offset="12529789">The District Court of Nebraska, did it sustain in a bona fide way in which it did, the Commission's order as a means of correcting violations, say of Section 3?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elmer_b_collins" startTime="3146.039" stopTime="3595.204">
            <label>Mr. Elmer B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="3146.039" offset="12584124">The Court in Nebraska did this, if understand his opinion correctly, it said there can be no Section 3 paragraph one violation here because the shippers suppose to be preferred are located on one railroad and those supposed to be prejudiced are on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.253" offset="12668970">And then they said, the evidence -- after putting that aside they said the evidence will not support a finding, the Commission's finding that service by the -- over the Union Pacific routes or this traffic that moves over the Union Pacific, no evidence will support a finding that that service is inadequate because the Commission had found that to the adequate, the route shorter, the time in-transit 24 hours at least in two, the change is shorter and very sensibly it seems to me the Court says, “You can't -- you can't have inadequacy of transportation and -- of traffic that actually moves over the Union Pacific,” and consequently, you can't condemn those routes under Section 15 (4), so as to reach it under clause (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.034" offset="12880039">You have no necessity to invoke clause (b) on that traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.341" offset="12897280">But then the Court did this strangest thing, it turn around and said, "There is evidence that will support a finding," although the Commission didn't make the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.500" offset="12937927">The Court said, “The service by a way of the Rio Grande having its higher rates and its longer route and so forth is inadequate and also inefficient and uneconomical.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.012" offset="13008039">I think the Commission's report was in such a confused state that it got the Nebraska court confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.830" offset="13035311">I should say that the Commission held that it could not order the -- any of the relief the Rio Grande wanted unless it first condemned existing routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.913" offset="13087556">And undoubtedly, if adequacy is to be tested by anything, I mean, adequacy of transportation which is the standard under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.243" offset="13124963">This is to be tested by anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.763" offset="13131024">It must be by the type service that the existing routes conformed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.016" offset="13148056">So, the -- the Commission and then these shorter routes, with a shorter time, adequate the Commission properly held to or any foreseeable volume of this traffic from the Northwest area to the east and from the east to the west without going over this mountainous road which the Commission found in the Rio Grande, to be longer, slower, less favorably situated and with the most onerous operating conditions of any of the western lines named in its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.843" offset="13291311">But the Commission and its desperation to find the ground on which to condemn the Union Pacific routes and divert some of the traffic to the Rio Grande said that our routes were inadequate because at points on the Rio Grande they are not available and higher rate supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.836" offset="13395278">In other words, the Union Pacific routes and for that I refer to all the routes that have a joint rate as we go through the northern lands, we are condemned and to be short-haul because we don't serve territory or stations that is located 400 or 500 miles or several hundred miles south of us through the Rocky Mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.288" offset="13485140">Now, this Court have such a case before it, in the very first one that came here involving a shorter haul ordered by the Commission after it got the power to compel through routes and joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.617" offset="13542400">It's Interstate Commerce Commission against the Northern Pacific Railroad and it's cited in our brief and it's 216 U.S. in which the Commission being anxious to have as many routes as possible and that was, and I will come to in a minute was one of its mysterious here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.580" offset="13614289">The Commission said that it issued an order telling the Northern Pacific Railroad on traffic to Seattle to join with the Union Pacific routes from Portland or the Union Pacific had no route then from Portland to Seattle, join with the other carriers from Portland to Seattle to get a through route over this longer area to Seattle, then over the Northern Pacific at that time, the statutes said that the Commission may make through routes and joint rates if no reasonable -- no reasonably satisfactory route exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.724" offset="13778860">Well, the Commission pointed out that these people like to go through Salt Lake City and they'd like to see different territory going one route and coming back another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.769" offset="13823060">But yet, it said that the Northern Pacific route was about equidistance, it had this good service and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.495" offset="13857959">Well, this Court said that, “Well, that might be a reason for a preference, it's not a reason for condemning the existing routes and you can't short-haul it on that theory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.550" offset="13898188">This -- this is just a repetition of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.426" offset="13917623">Now, I intended to -- to tell you some more of the weird things which the Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.611" offset="13946358">It proposes the short-haul, the shorter, faster, adequate, direct lines by adding a longer, more onerous and slower line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.051" offset="14004140">On those facts, it is my contention that the Commission cannot at anytime make an order, short-hauling, the existing routes, so long as those facts, as to those other facts and there so found by the Commission are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.577" offset="14082299">They can't dispute the physical and geographical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.241" offset="14100898">The Commission next misconstrued it's authority under this clause (b) which, I might say, authorizes that the short-haul existing routes is the -- if the Commission finds that the proposed through route is needed to provide adequate and the more efficient or more economic transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.745" offset="14206955">Now, the Commission says, “Well, the Union Pacific provides transportation services that are as -- as good as any of the Rio Grande could,” but the shippers' testimony suggest a need for more adequate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.177" offset="14280620">I -- I suggest to Your Honors if we're to add a limitless word like “more” in front of the quote -- phrase, more adequate and more efficient, why then, the Commission has found a way completely around the -- or the interpretation that it puts on clause (b) because every route it adds that could say would make it more adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3950.567" offset="15802201">But instead of making the findings required by clause (b) of which the Commission said explicitly that it revoke -- that it invoked and was making the basis of its order, said the shippers' testimony, indicated the need for more adequate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.969" offset="15867820">It did not find that the routes by way of the Rio Grande were needed and this Court, Mr. Justice Black in the Pennsylvania Railroad against the United States in 323 U.S. specifically of clause (b) said that the word needed in clause (b) was not redundant of or with the general language in Section 15 paragraph 3, that Congress had a purpose in using these other and different words in clause (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.405" offset="16013584">So, the Commission did not find the Rio Grande route was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.864" offset="16031451">It did not find that the route would provide more efficient transportation and that is one of the -- one of the qualities of transportation which this Court has said ever since the Transportation Act 1920 was one of the basic concerns of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.890" offset="16103549">That is efficiency as well as adequacy of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.928" offset="16123611">Then the Commission said or found that the Rio Grande route was necessary to provide more economic routes, more economic transportation and I submit to you that all that means is that the Commission has misjudged the statutory pattern because what it is done is to reduce the Rio Grande rates from the combination level down to equalized them with Union Pacific route rates and that isn't what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.956" offset="16271778">It means that this proposed route over here was have merits of its own which will give the public adequate, more efficient and more economic transportation what the -- which the existing routes can't give.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.338" offset="16337293">It doesn't give the Commission authority to simply substitute the joint rates for the combination rates and then sit back and say, “Well now, transportation is more economic and the routes are justified because it's obvious that ordering rates over the Rio Grande equal to those already in existence over the Union Pacific for many years,” does not provide for the shipper anymore economic transportation than he has and there is no -- there is no possibility of anybody justifying the -- the economy, as we know economy that is a standpoint of which can be done with the least effort and the least expense in transporting over the Rio Grande as in transporting over the Union Pacific because you've got, let's say 219 miles of additional transportation over the most onerous operating miles in the country, a pure economic waste there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.377" offset="16605414">So, none of the -- the essential findings were made by the Commission even to justify clause (b), then it departed not only from that finding, which it had been invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.877" offset="16655464">It adopted the new one of all possible routes for perishable products and if that is to be done, then everytime the Commission says a segment of traffic in its judgment needs all possible routes, then reasonable through routes, a standard of the Act and adequacy of transportation, as Circuit Judge Johnsens says, "The carriers might as well forget any possible protection under the short-haul prohibition of the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.563" offset="16766224">Then, not only did the Commission substituted its own standard for the statutory standard, after finding itself unable to make the findings required by clause (b), but of all things, seizing upon perishable products as is its justification for short-hauling the existing routes, turn around and put ordinary livestock in there with -- within the classification of perishable food products, not being satisfied to that it tossed in dried beans within that classification and that not being enough, they put it in westbound marble and granite tombstones from Georgia and Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="4509.033" offset="18036088">These five States have intervened to these proceeding from the very inception before the Interstate Commerce Commission and we have been in opposition to the proposal of the Rio Grande.</text>

            <text syncTime="4535.897" offset="18143504">These States before the ICC, made it undisputedly clear that in there area, there was no need for the proposed routes of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.713" offset="18198779">It was made just as clear that the granting of financial relief through this bridge line railroad by approving its proposals in the absence of any need or benefit from the route would adversely affect our economy in the existing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.343" offset="18269309">Now, we're presently served in the Pacific Northwest by some five transcontinental railroads, the Milwaukee, the Southern Pacific, the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and the Union Pacific.</text>

            <text syncTime="4602.349" offset="18409326">They showed conclusively that there was no need for this longer route.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.424" offset="18429597">Out of the four states of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming, but two individual shippers from the State of Oregon came forward on behalf of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.612" offset="18482364">One of those two testified that the only purpose of having the route available would be in the event of some emergency and the other witness made no present claim for any need.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.145" offset="18536490">These states also made it quite clear that the Union Pacific provides the fastest and the shortest and the most economical route to the southern and eastern markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.402" offset="18585600">Now, they attempted to point out and did so successfully that the wastefulness involved in the longer and more circuitous route would ultimately have to be borne by the shippers from that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.914" offset="18643592">We've learned up there from other painful experience because we're so far from distant markets in the east and the south that were pretty much dependent for fast and low cost transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4724.468" offset="18897816">The diversion which must of course result from approving the proposal of the Rio Grande means that shippers for one thing, who are not informed about transportation matters and are part of the country particularly those in the east, they won't necessarily have the control over the shipments and even though there is no compulsion to use the route of the Rio Grande, assuming its proposals are accepted, nevertheless, because these shippers are not convergent with transportation facilities and routes in our part of the country, not having this control, that traffic, nevertheless, can be diverted to the longer lines of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.136" offset="19080464">If there is diversion which there unquestionably will be, if the proposal of the Rio Grande is sustained, that means of course a resulting loss of revenue to the carrier, to UP.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.566" offset="19138247">Any loss of revenue, of course, must be made up someway either by effectuating economies which ultimately will result in effecting the party and the degree of service in our part of the country or could very possibly result in an increase in the level of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.972" offset="19215882">And we're not very favorably impressed of -- in our part of the country as to increase rates because of the disadvantage we now have because of our distance from these markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="5047.087" offset="20188264">This Court will appreciate that it's very difficult to explain confusion, much less rationalize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.119" offset="20220447">I -- I will attempt however to at least identify to the Court what we think is the confusion in this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.535" offset="20246047">It begins all right by referring to Section 15 (4) as a basis for the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.501" offset="20269976">And upon that basis the report should be considered as to what it meets the requirements of 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.869" offset="20295471">But the report goes on and roams all over the Act and ends up with the finding of a violation of Section 1 and Section 3 (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.736" offset="20330893">That report denies and find there's no violation of Section 3 (4) except as to the local Bamberger Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.801" offset="20363180">Now, we contend that there's no support for the findings of violation and they're completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.323" offset="20389198">With reference to Section 1, the only evidence in the record, as to the reasonableness of rates in support of the finding that the Rio Grande's combination rates are unreasonable is a comparison of the combination rate with the joint rate and they say the combination is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.896" offset="20455549">But this Court has said repeatedly, the combination rates are always higher and that is wholly insufficient evidence to support a violation of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.132" offset="20496509">There's nothing in the record as to length of haul or various factors that go into rate making, competition, the cost of service, density or volume of traffic or transportation conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.715" offset="20538828">Turning to Section 3 (4), which has Mr. Holman stated, is the only Section involved here in which a carrier can make a complaint against another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.422" offset="20585639">The Commission found no violation of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.671" offset="20598596">No discrimination was established by the Rio Grande against any of the 214 defendant railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.759" offset="20627017">And the reason the Commission so held was because there was no showing of similarity of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.306" offset="20649169">As a matter of fact, the findings of the Commission showed the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.435" offset="20665678">Now, this finding of the Commission on Section 3 (4) precludes the Rio Grande from maintaining in this action that there's any violation to which it can lay hold out.</text>

            <text syncTime="5314.360" offset="21257404">There's other reason, we urged the history of the proviso of Section 3 (1) at page 83 of our brief and the -- the fact that there was no showing in this record of the classic requirements of a shipper discrimination case on which you can base a finding, the violation of 3 (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.682" offset="21326681">Now, in that connection and in connection with the matter of shipper violations, many suggest to the Court that the rate disadvantage that is referred to here as to processors and feeders on the Rio Grande is compared with the Union Pacific is a natural and a proper relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.759" offset="21398988">The record shows without dispute that there's processors and feeders in western Nebraska, Wyoming, and northeastern -- northern Colorado, who have the joint through rates to the -- to Idaho and these processors have an advantage over the processors and feeders on the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.563" offset="21466175">But the record also shows that these same processors and feeders in Nebraska, Wyoming, and northern Colorado have a disadvantage with those same processors when they get their materials and supplies from Arizona and New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.004" offset="21516016">In other words, the territory adjacent to wherever you're located, you're shorter and you have a lower rate and that's a natural and a proper application of rules of rates and the Rio Grande has an advantage on New Mexico and Arizona and a disadvantage on their -- farther territory, farther away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.628" offset="21590413">And they -- in this proceeding they want -- they want the advantage both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.517" offset="21605982">They want all the advantages and then of the disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.881" offset="21615491">So, I say to you under 3 (1) factually there is no case in addition to the other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.664" offset="21642553">Now, with reference to the handling of these sections, I want to emphasis that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.523" offset="21658018">Section 1 and 3 deal with the reasonableness and the equity of charges to shippers under similar conditions, Section 15 (4) and 15 (3) deal with an entirely different subject, that is the adequacy and the efficiency of transportation facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.898" offset="21735549">Now, you can't create through routes under Section 1 or 3 and you can't reduce rates or equalize rates, or equalize transit charges under Sections 15 (3) and (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.289" offset="21785078">There's a direct remedy in these respective sections and you can't give one class of sections for the purpose of remedy and matters in other sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.091" offset="21820291">Our brief at page 74 refers to a long line of cases in which the Commissioner said that they can't invoke Section 1 in order to avoid the requirements of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.874" offset="21867416">Now, with reference to the use of Section 15 (4) which they apparently use here, the through route section, the Commission did to cure violations of Section 1 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.906" offset="21907540">Let me specifically refer this Court to page 100 of our Nebraska brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.379" offset="21929482">We point out there that when the through route section was added to the law in 1906, it contained a definite provision that Section 15 (4) could be used to enforce any provision of the Act and then in 1910 the Congress eliminated that sentence entirely from the Act and that elimination is a direct indication and statement of intention that Section 15 (4) could no longer be used to enforce other provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.055" offset="22064170">Now, I realized that there is a provision in Section 15 (4), a parenthetical sentence except as provided in Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.585" offset="22098338">But that means if it means anything that they must have intended at sometime to write some provisions into Section 3 with reference to through routes, it can't be use as a complete nullification of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.047" offset="22156121">Furthermore, the meaning of that exception is moot here because there's no violation of Section 3 on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.850" offset="22195304">Well, this Court in a long line of cases has held that Section 15 (4) cannot be subverted or nullified by any other provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.498" offset="22241907">The recent Thompson case pointed this out that the form of the order couldn't be used to avoid the requirements of 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.755" offset="22270955">Previous to that in the Stickell case, 323 U.S. this Court found a rate disadvantage but bottomed the case entirely on Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.580" offset="22310243">In the Chicago, I. and L. case, 270 U.S., the opinion points out that under the guise of Section 3 this Court will not permit a through route to be created under Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.194" offset="22356741">In the Central New Jersey case, the same holding was made with reference to the use of Section 3 by indirection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.021" offset="22384013">The Saint Louis Southwestern case involving discrimination against Paducah, Kentucky carefully pointed out that in removing the discrimination this Court would not say that any new route had to be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.276" offset="22437094">So, we say to the Court that you can't under this legislative history and under these decisions use 15 (4) as a means of remedying what you say or other violations of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5743.486" offset="22973858">In conclusion, may I suggest to the Court that the position of these five States, our conviction is that the great tragedy in this whole case is the disregard and the neglect of transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.162" offset="23032581">This Court said in the Rock Island case that this declaration of policy goes to the basic power of the Commission and that policy emphasizes economy and efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.394" offset="23081482">Now, in this report of 60 pages, this Court will not find one sentence in that report of the Commission discussing transportation policy and yet this situation here is the exact reverse, the complete reverse of every prior through routes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.199" offset="23156715">If the Court will read the Subiaco case and the Stickell case rendered by this Court and the (Inaudible) case rendered by the Commission in 276 I.C.C., the Court will find that in all prior through route cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.076" offset="23216274">The new route was either shorter or most -- more efficient or save time or something and in this case you have the absolute reverse of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.125" offset="23252428">And yet, for the first time in history where this about change in the invocation of through routes, the Commission has not in the entire report given one sentence to a consideration of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.775" offset="23307076">I suggest to the Court in our brief that under that Tanzola case, a recent three-judge opinion on that point alone this order should be set aside because the Court said so in that case that when there's a refusal, when they give no consideration to this important requirement of the Act that that alone should set aside the entire report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.506" offset="23385966">So, in conclusion I submit to this Court that if the technique in approach that is adopted in this case is sufficient to sustain this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.863" offset="23431419">Then as stated by Judge Johnsen in the Omaha case, the railroads of this country and I might add the State Commissions and the shippers they represent may as well forget entirely the provisions and restrictions and protection that this Court has always given them under Section 15 (4) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5897.287" offset="23589094">I should like to turn first to the single question considered by the Colorado District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.201" offset="23620754">Further, there are already in existence through routes by Ogden and the Rio Grande line between points in the northwest or excluded territory and the Colorado common points and points east to the Colorado common points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.554" offset="23690136">The Commission divided five-to-five on that issue of fact and therefore refused to grant the relief which Rio Grande requested and the basis of through routes being in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.014" offset="23755964">We accept the definition of a through route which counsel for the railroads have put forward orally and in briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.671" offset="23798596">Unlike the rest of the parties before the Court, we accept Thompson of the Unites States, the recent decision of this Court as laying down the controlling test for the existence of a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.945" offset="23855752">The Thompson case was decided while this case was pending before the Commission for decision, perhaps it had a heavy impact upon the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.305" offset="23897130">In the Thompson case this Court held that a through route did not exist where there was no evidence that any shipment had ever been made over the alleged through route or that the carriers had ever offered through service over the route and the Court stated, “In short, the test of the existence of a through route is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service."</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.518" offset="24030041">Then this Court stated that otherwise in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.024" offset="24044042">The carrier's course of business negatives the existence of a through route and that was the test which the Commission sought to apply on that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.692" offset="24090749">On its report, the Commission put it this way, "It is necessary to determine whether the carriers in this proceeding hold themselves out as offering through transportation service from and to the points here concerned by the Ogden Gateway as indicated by their course of business in respect of traffic over the routes in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.875" offset="24191478">The facts bearing upon the existence of through routes are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.970" offset="24219794">As you've been told for a period of time beginning in 1897 through routes and joint rates applying to such routes were in existence to and from points in the excluded territory and from and to points east of Colorado via Ogden and the Rio Grande line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.281" offset="24297117">By 1912, Union Pacific had progressively canceled these joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.814" offset="24327210">So far as the record shows the Union Pacific has never formally or in terms purported to cancel through routes with the Rio Grande and Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.587" offset="24378305">The evidence as to actual shipments over the Rio Grande via Ogden falls into several categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.195" offset="24416758">During World War II, about 19,000 carloads destined to the excluded territory, that is coming from points in the south and east, were diverted by Rio Grande to Union Pacific at Ogden or Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.872" offset="24495438">These were shipments which have been originally routed to destinations in the excluded territory via Rio Grande and carriers such as Southern Pacific, Western Pacific with which Rio Grande does have through routes and joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.268" offset="24556983">But these shipments were diverted by Rio Grande to Union Pacific at Ogden or Salt Lake pursuant to war time emergency routing orders issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission under paragraphs 15 and 16 of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.619" offset="24626469">Also, during World War II several special trains of troops and military equipment were initially routed from southern and eastern points to points of the Northwest Territory by Rio Grande, Ogden, Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.119" offset="24696372">Again, in February 1949 when Union Pacific's main line through Cheyenne was blocked with snow, Union Pacific diverted it to Rio Grande between Denver and Utah junctions of those two lines about 1400 carloads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.739" offset="24778919">This diversion too was pursuant to ICC service orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.961" offset="24799817">Now, in addition to this war time or emergency shipments there was evidence of other scattered shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.925" offset="24839628">In 1948, a representative year there were 37 carload shipments moved on through bills of lading issued by Union Pacific or other connecting carriers in the north from points in the Northwest Territory by Union Pacific, Ogden, Rio Grande to Utah and Colorado common points served by both Union Pacific and Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.211" offset="24956761">And in the same year there were 18 westbound -- 18 carloads westbound from points in the east by Rio Grande, Ogden, Union Pacific to destinations in the Northwest Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.435" offset="25025724">Applying the Thompson case the Commission made the following findings as to these actual shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.726" offset="25054877">First discussing the war time and emergency diversions of traffic the Commission said, this is at volume two of the transcript, page 1526, “These movements as well as those under service orders were made under emergency conditions and not in the ordinary course of the carrier's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.167" offset="25136588">They show only that the Rio Grande routes were physically practicable and have no bearing upon the issue of whether or not these routes constitute through routes within the meaning of that term as used in the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.331" offset="25193221">In order words, the Commission was recognizing that on those war time and emergency diversion of traffic, the carriers involved had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.064" offset="25228225">They acted under the actual of potential compulsion of the Commission's emergency routing orders in paragraphs 15 and 16 of -- of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.909" offset="25279634">More generally, the Commission found there is no indication that any of the defendants has ever solicited any traffic from and to the areas here concerned for routing over a Rio Grande route by which a higher combination rate is applied or has ever used such a Rio Grande routing except where called upon to do so by routing specified by a shipper or by prior connecting carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.514" offset="25386005">In the other words, so far as this record shows the Commission said, “The carrier's course of business has been and is to use the Union Pacific routes except where called upon to use the Rio Grande routes by force of shippers or connecting carriers' routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.228" offset="25456849">The whole course of conduct of Union Pacific so far as revealed has been for many years and is now to guard jealously it's long haul and not open commercially the Rio Grande routes on this traffic.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.445" offset="25521737">So, the Commission concluded that there were at that time no through routes over the Rio -- or over the Rio Grande via Ogden or Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.746" offset="25562906">In the evidence in support of that conclusion can be summarized as -- very briefly, it's undisputed that Union Pacific has not held itself out in any affirmative or soliciting sense as offering through transportation service with Rio Grande by Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.237" offset="25644931">The -- the record in this case bristles with statements, recognitions, and testimony by shippers and everyone else concerned that it was the policy of Union Pacific to hold on to it's long haul from the northwest on it's own lines through (Inaudible) of Cheyenne pleased.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.694" offset="25742733">With it the Commission correctly held that the war time and emergency routing did not constitute a course of business or any offer by Union Pacific of through transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.838" offset="25811278">In 1948, as represented here, there were evidence of a the total of 55 carload shipments which moved on through bills of lading over Rio Grande at the higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.656" offset="25878570">And the Commission characterized these scattered commercial shipments as of an isolated nature, isolated in that that they compare with total shipments of a 122,000 carloads moving in and out of the Northwest Territory each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.308" offset="25957146">Union Pacific representative testified as to these 55 shipments, for example, that they were obligated to comply with the routing specified by shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.158" offset="26012630">And Rio Grande points to this and says that Section 15 (8) of the Intestate Commerce Act only gives a shipper the right to choose between alternative existing through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.685" offset="26070727">So, they argued that if Union Pacific felt compelled as its representative testified to honor that the -- to honor shippers' choice of routing that they must have been doing so under compulsion of Section 15 (8) which gives a choice only between through routes and that this amounts to an admission that through routes were in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.737" offset="26162887">On the other hand, there is evidence that some perhaps all of these 1948 scattered commercial shipments were routed by shippers who did not -- who did not know or who overlooked the fact that joint rates were not applicable over the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.484" offset="26237910">And one of these shipments for example, the difference between joint rates over Union Pacific and combination rates over Rio Grande amounted to $866.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.526" offset="26286080">Five members of the Commission joining in a majority report held that there must be proof that through routes existed in a practical, commercially feasible sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6584.883" offset="26339474">They were impressed by the general thrust of Section 15 (3) and (4) as interpreted only a few weeks before by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.239" offset="26376882">Sections which represent careful congressional restriction of the power to prescribe new through routes and the five Commissioners felt that it would be an evasion of Section 15 (4) defined that a through route existed merely on a showing that an on occasional shipper perhaps through an advertence specified movement over the alleged through route despite the prohibitively higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.157" offset="26496627">On the same evidence, the remaining five Commissioners were of the view that through routes were in existence as alleged by Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.676" offset="26534661">As stated in -- a dissenting opinion in which Commissioners Mahaffey, Splawn and Cross concurred, they view the situation as follows, “All of these evidence clearly supports the finding that the routes are existing established through routes over which through routes apply and that the railroad participating therein consent to their use as through routes and freely hold themselves out as ready and willing to perform transportation service wholly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.493" offset="26645943">And further, after -- after referring to this Court's decision in Thompson, the three dissenting Commissioner said, “Here is -- here, there is substantial evidence of a holding out that through transportation will be furnished and that execution of such offers by the issuance of through bills of lading.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.276" offset="26721071">I should point out that those Commissioners dissenting relied upon the evidence of actual shipments both -- that those consisting at the war time emergency routings, diversion of traffic and the -- the commercial shipments as evidenced by the typical year 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="6766.793" offset="27067141">Out of a 122,000 carloads of shipments a year as in 1948, only a total of 55 both eastbound and westbound were shipped by Rio Grande, through shipments between the eastern points to the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.676" offset="27134642">Then from that, the five Commissioners concluded that the roads were in fact commercially close as though there had been a -- a barrier placed across the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.760" offset="27178945">And the other -- the other Commissioners, the other five Commissioners in effect that that there have been some shipments through.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.657" offset="27202560">They've been made on through bills of lading.</text>
