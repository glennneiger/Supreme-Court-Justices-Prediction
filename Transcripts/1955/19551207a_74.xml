            <text syncTime="16.754" offset="66978">This is a tax case involving a federal documentary stamp tax imposed upon the issuance of corporate debt securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.781" offset="143047">It is imposed by Section 1801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and it corresponds roughly to the tax which is imposed upon the issuance of corporate equity securities, corporate stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.400" offset="213577">The issue in this case is really the application of this tax provision to what is known as a private placement as distinguished from a public offering of these securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.708" offset="278779">Leslie Salt is a corporation which issued two instruments, one for $1 million payable to the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, and, one, for $3 million dollars so that the total debt was $4 million to the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.683" offset="370730">Now, these two instruments, one of which is reprinted at page 87 of the record, are called Sinking Fund Promissory Notes, which in itself is an unusual term.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.492" offset="429871">They have a term of 15 years and they are supported by a loan agreement, which was simultaneously entered into and which imposes detailed restrictions upon the corporation's policies with respect to financing, business and its dividend policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.690" offset="514717">On demand from the Government, stamp -- stamp taxes were fixed to these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.606" offset="546377">The corporation then petitioned for a refund which was refused and the suit for a refund followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.561" offset="646165">I don't know, it doesn't appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.664" offset="654629">It is -- it's not important whether there's a demand, the demand isn't a formal part of -- of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.952" offset="675736">They were -- if it is taxable, they were required to put a stamp on it, if it wasn't, they won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.702" offset="694753">It's not a -- it's not a functional part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.412" offset="709590">It might, just as well, not have been a demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.286" offset="721084">I think the only -- the only importance of the demand is that there's no concession by Leslie Salt that this was a taxable transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.477" offset="749819">They put it on there because they were told to do it, not because they thought it was taxable transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.076" offset="776255">The taxpayer asserts that its instruments are not debentures within the meaning of the statue by reason of the fact that they were not issued under an indenture and by reason of the fact that there was no trustee involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.408" offset="849607">The Government, on the other hand, claims that these instruments are taxable as corporate debt securities being both debentures and certificates of indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.069" offset="904255">That brings us to the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.144" offset="920555">Statutory provisions, Section 1800 and 1801 are reprinted at page 2 -- in pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.890" offset="971546">At the top of page 3 of the -- if the language was -- this Court has called upon to construe, that the language which describes the instruments on which the tax -- the stamp tax is imposed, it reads on all bonds, debentures are certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.956" offset="1063811">Those are the -- those are the words that we believe covered this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.081" offset="1092232">The note, which we must determine much as must examine to determine whether it falls within that language is reprinted at page 87 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.114" offset="1152418">The loan agreement which was entered into simultaneously with the note follows that beginning at page 93 and running through 40 odd pages thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.976" offset="1231830">The fact that these instruments are called notes cannot be determinative as to whether or not they are taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.318" offset="1277179">There are many corporate securities, which publicly issued, it's enlisted on the New York Stock Exchange, which I -- which I've called -- commonly called "notes."</text>
            <text syncTime="329.481" offset="1317825">But they are admittedly bonds or debentures as the treasury regulations provided cannot be the -- the name that the issuer gives these documents which controls, rather it must be their own essential characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.142" offset="1396506">Now, the characteristics of these particular instruments are that there were two documents evidencing a promise to pay a very substantial sum of money, they were issued for a relatively long term, 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.756" offset="1483024">Capital was to be useful for capital purposes, the corporation wanted working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.763" offset="1514998">And what's even more important, they were supported by these loan agreement to which I have referred which in its terms is comparable to the ordinary indenture which is issued with what is formally, what are formally called "debentures."</text>
            <text syncTime="397.252" offset="1588976">In all essentials these are the kind of instruments, which if they were sold to the general public in an ordinary distribution would be recognized by everybody as being corporate debt securities to which this tax is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.817" offset="1651252">And the only reason that we --</text>

            <text syncTime="459.666" offset="1838602">The -- the reason that we have this question at all, I think the reason that -- that the issue was before us is that these securities were not issued to the public, they were issued in two large pieces to insurance companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.283" offset="2709107">That modifies only the -- the portion which was added in 1918 which went on and -- and said and all instruments, however, termed issued by any corporation with interest coupon are -- are in registered form, which was added to -- to codify a -- an internal revenue interpretation that if an instrument was registered, or had coupons attached, then it was clearly taxable on any -- under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.074" offset="2828225">But that doesn't modify the first clause which is all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation which preexisted in the law and this other was added to take care of its specific interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.988" offset="2903876">Private placements are irrelatively new method of -- of financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.170" offset="2932611">It involves selling a security to a restricted number of purchases instead of distributing it through investment bankers to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.437" offset="2981721">The witness for the taxpayer estimates that this method of financing rarely commenced in about 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.095" offset="3028323">In any -- in any rate, it's drawn to a great rapidity in recent years studied by the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that there were $11 billion of corporate securities which were privately placed between 1946 and 1951 and the private placements constituted 44% of all corporate offerings in the year 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.094" offset="3140336">But what is really significant if not the size of this method of financing but that what the corporations were selling through this method is essentially the same thing that they were selling through public offerings before.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.989" offset="3207941">Now, the reason that the taxpayer places emphasis on the fact that these instruments are called "notes" as such is that at one time, promissory notes in checks and drafts were subject to taxation under a separate provision of the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.017" offset="3296026">Then in 1924, I think it was, this separate provision of taxing promissory notes, checks, and drafts was refilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.948" offset="3339703">And these taxpayers' argument that Congress showed by the repeal of that separate provision taxing those particular instruments an intent not to tax the kind of instrument which is involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.556" offset="3406158">Now, at the time Congress acted in this way, private placement were -- were not used as a -- as a method of financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.720" offset="3434789">Promissory notes were the ordinary commercial paper, short term paper which was issued by facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.905" offset="3463523">These instruments which are here involved, although they're called Sinking Fund Promissory Notes are very different from the ordinary negotiable instrument, promissory note which a bank -- which a bank takes for -- for a short time loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.581" offset="3526322">One thing, they have a maturity of 15 years or another thing they're issued in connection with a loan agreement which is a 40-paged document and which is certainly not ordinarily used in connection with -- with notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.885" offset="3583478">So, I think that it's fair to say that when Congress repealed a separate tax on promissory notes in 1944, they could hardly be said to have expressed any intent with rather these particular instruments which are before the Court in which that method of financing not being invoked at that time, they -- they knew nothing about that Congress could not have intended anything with respect to this particular situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.914" offset="6319647">Also, many times, the corporation will divide the same notes between banks and insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.990" offset="6343889">It makes further the sense to say that part of them would be taxable and part of them wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.816" offset="6363220">One of the most illuminating decisions on this case is a recent case out of the Second Circuit in which Judge Collin wrote the majority opinion and in which he found an issue of notes to a bank, a big issue of notes to a bank was not taxable because it was a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.812" offset="6451200">Now, I think that the position which we are taking here is reconcilable with the opinion of the Second Circuit in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.202" offset="6492787">In that particular case, emphasis is placed upon the fact that in the transaction, there was no language of purchase and sale, rather it was passed language of borrowing and lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.205" offset="6548793">In this case, the language is the language of purchase and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.915" offset="6567602">In that case, the lender was a bank and some emphasis was laid on that in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.988" offset="6595918">In this case, we have an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.094" offset="6608353">In that case, the -- there was no provision for redemption with the premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.691" offset="6630713">In this case, there is a provision for a premium on -- on prepayment which is the same as in the case of debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.497" offset="6657985">But even more important, that case places a great deal of emphasis upon the fact that the banks were getting instruments which were not marketable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.322" offset="6697273">They couldn't be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.708" offset="6706782">In this case, there is a specific provision that the insurance companies can demand that the notes be broken down into smaller pieces which admittedly would be debentures, issued under a trust indenture with a trustee and then resolved so that there is a marketability of this obligation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.416" offset="6789642">So, I -- I suggest to the Court that even on the -- in the language of -- of the Second Circuit in the Niles-Bement-Pond case that this -- this case would still be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.429" offset="6857665">It is a peculiar -- it would be a peculiar interpretation of -- of this provision if it were to permit more than half of the debt securities, capital debt securities issued by corporations to escape taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.352" offset="7313345">Because in urging a reversal and the great weight of authority on the point in the appellate courts below, the United States will also put itself from the position of urging a repudiation of a uniform consisted construction of the statute but extended over a period of 30 years during which the Leslie notes would be excluded from taxation and this administrative construction survived free reenactments of the statute, including the reenactment in 1939, under which the present tax is sought to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.158" offset="7464542">This same construction existed for at least 14 years after the private placement became prominent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.355" offset="7501322">It existed both under the prior regulations and for seven years under the regulations that are in exist today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.222" offset="7532878">The change in treasury practice came about solely because of certain unfortunate language in a Second Circuit decision of that language having since been repudiated in result by the same Court and the language is also not been followed by five Courts of Appeals which have considered the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.123" offset="7664431">In that case, the Court made no attempt to make an independent analysis starting from scratch but just accepted the earlier Second Circuit decision at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.865" offset="7711451">Now, with respect to the contention that this is a holy unknown method of financing, I rely on the -- on a pamphlet that the Government's cites in its brief put out by the Securities and Exchange Commission called privately place securities cause of votation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.984" offset="7791909">At page two of that pamphlet, the FCC states that it's incorrect to state that this method of financing was wholly unknown of the earlier years of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.731" offset="7834854">They stated, it didn't amount too much, but personally speaking, only about 3.7% between 1900 and 1934, but Mr. (Inaudible), also cited by the Government, at page -- 1108 of his book, states that the total amount of financing done this way between 1900 and 1934, amounted to $1 billion, so it's not something that just came out of thin air in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.834" offset="7959301">It's been in existent for some time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.708" offset="8182805">In speaking about this consistent administrative construction, the starting place is 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.074" offset="8216242">Prior to that date, there have been a few tentative (Inaudible) on the subject of what purported to be promissory notes that were -- which were essentially debentures or bonds but no comprehensive attempt have been made to classify what purported the promissory note of which were really bonds or debentures on the one hand and those which were actually promissory notes on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.902" offset="8327523">But in 1920, the attempt was made in regulations 55, the two significant articles of that regulation are reproduced at page 25 of my brief and side by side so it's simple to compare it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.868" offset="8431386">Twenty-five of my brief Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.496" offset="8445910">In Article 8, instruments which purported to be promissory notes were, nevertheless, taxable as bonds whether they were called bonds, debentures, or notes providing they were issued in numbers under a trust indenture and then registered our coupon bearing form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.094" offset="8516336">On the other hand, Article 48 states that instruments that don't contain those provisions and which purports to be promissory notes are taxes promissory notes, and the less we note fits squarely within Article 48 because there is no limitation in 48 concerning duration or amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.017" offset="8596062">The two factors that counsel has ceased upon is apparently shoving an instrument into in the classification of debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.904" offset="8627513">And at the time these regulations came out according to the SCC, according to Mr. (Inaudible), the private place that was far from being unknown, it -- it amounted to a significant portion of the total corporate flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.260" offset="8696999">With these two regulations before it, four years later, Congress proceeded to repeal the tax on promissory notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.151" offset="8732526">I suggest that the measure of the type of instrument that the tax was repealed on is contained in Article 48, and the congressional debate has certainly doesn't help us on that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.882" offset="8795429">I would like to also add at this point that Article 8 of regulation 55 was carried forward without any change at all in the language through several reenactments of the regulations and (Voice Overlap) the same when the statute was reenacted in 1939 and that is the statue under which the present tax is sought to be imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.190" offset="8912666">Well, 48 was dropped in the tax on promissory note withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.778" offset="8939102">The statute was again reenacted in 1926 with no attempt made to expand the classification of taxable instruments, almost immediately after the regulations were again reenacted also with no attempt made to expand the classifications of -- of taxable instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.557" offset="9018201">In 1941, the regulations were amended and took the form they have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.371" offset="9045473">As counsel says, the regulations state that whatever the name the document contains as a matter of answering it because there's no attempt made to state what are the essential characteristics of bonds or debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.064" offset="9100225">However, under the present regulations, the 1941 regulations has conceded in M.T. 32 at page 32 and 33 of my brief, even then, the Treasury construed the statute is not imposing a tax on instruments of the title that are before the Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.789" offset="9223105">I think the Treasury's construction was correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.772" offset="9238988">I believe debentures are instruments that are issued in a series that are copied by a trust indenture and that have registrations -- provisions or in coupon bearing form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.983" offset="9283918">I think the Treasury was accurate then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.155" offset="9292591">I think the Treasury's construction is further confirmed by the uncontradicted testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.225" offset="9332820">I submit that with that administrative history before us that these documents should be considered not debentures as a matter of law particularly since the statute was reenacted several times while that construction still was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.615" offset="9394364">And I'll repeat that the only reason the construction was changed was the result of the Second Circuit decision which another panel proceeded to virtually destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.756" offset="9450998">However, if that construction were considered in any way dubious, we have the testimony in the record to fall back on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.566" offset="9490181">The witness, Beckett, an employee of Life and Company testified as an expert concerning the characteristics of debentures at the term as used and understood in the financial world of -- the sum and substance of his testimony was that debentures were instruments that were prepared in the form to meet -- to permit the public treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.278" offset="9617032">He also stated that they were accompanied by an indenture to which a trustee was a party and that they were commonly marketed through underwriters that so far as the ultimate buyer from the investing public was concerned, he didn't negotiate at all as to terms since his sole decision was whether he was going to buy or not to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.279" offset="9697071">In marked contrast to the negotiations between the insurance companies and Leslie Salt, where the insurance companies were throughout taking the initiative and opposing terms on the borrower rather than the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.638" offset="9758511">The testimony of the witness, Beckett, makes particular sense when we go through the provisions of Article 8 in the light of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.251" offset="9800934">If debentures are instruments designed for public trading and Leslie Salt had issued $4 million in debentures, each of a thousand dollar denomination, certainly, each holder of $1000 debenture wouldn't have been given a loan agreement at the type that was given to two insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.356" offset="9881391">It would be too inconvenient, too expensive for the debenture holder to enforce the terms of the loan agreement assuming that the terms were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.517" offset="9922038">For that reason, each holder of the debenture does not get a separate accompanying agreement, what he gets is the protection of a trustee to enforce the rights of all debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.064" offset="9980238">I'll take the provision for registered form in Article 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.649" offset="9994553">Now, that provision makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.671" offset="10002599">If you have instruments that are designed for public trading because if A holds a debenture today and B tomorrow, and C next week, you have to have some provision for registration so that payments of principal and interest don't go astray or if you lack a provision for registration of the necessity of submitting coupons of the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.287" offset="10125061">So, our second contention is that the correctness of the prior administrative construction is confirmed by the uncontradicted testimony of the receipt and the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.184" offset="10176679">And for that reason, it should still be adhered to even if the court were not willing to give weight to the successive reenactments of the statute while the construction remained unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.621" offset="10230387">Our third contention that deals solely with the construction of the words of a statute unaided by a part administrative construction and unaided by the testimony and I refer to the clause that Mr. Justice Reed mentioned or the phrase “all instruments” however termed issued and registered form or with attached coupons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.050" offset="10332160">I think it is correct to state that that instrument was designed to catch instruments which might not have been formally taxable unless it were added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.239" offset="10372911">It was added in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.515" offset="10382002">To me, the purpose of that provision is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.397" offset="10393496">It was intended to tax something that purported to be a promissory note and not a debenture or certificate of indebtedness but which did have the same general characteristics and that it had attached coupons or a provision for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.043" offset="10448144">Now, we ignore that 1918 clause and tax the Leslie notes despite the fact they don't purport to be debentures or certificates of indebtedness and are not issued in registered form or with attached coupons, I submit the clause has been read out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.652" offset="10518570">And for that reason, since one of the most elementary rule to a statutory construction would be violated, just on the words of the statute, the decision should be affirmed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.858" offset="10607386">With respect to this contention concerning certificates of indebtedness, there is a long administrative gloss to that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.777" offset="10647092">The first attempt to define a term appears in Appendix A of my brief, Treasury decision 2713.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.934" offset="10703726">That appears at the bottom of the second page of the -- of the Treasury decision, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.319" offset="10729221">However, that the definition there contained was considered too broad by the Treasury itself, and the opinion by the Solicitor of the Treasury was put out, that appears as Appendix C in which he states that he thinks that prior construction is too broad and that the Court will note at paragraph 3 of page 8 of that appendix, he deals with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.431" offset="10869656">His first notes that debentures are issued in a form can be -- to be bought and sold as investments which of course is our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.206" offset="10904764">Then he states the term "certificates of indebtedness" has also come to have in commercial use as similar meaning and then he quotes the decision by this Court in which the Court states that certificates of indebtedness are practically synonymous with bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.105" offset="10964323">He then concludes that the term "certificates of indebtedness" should be restricted to instruments known generally as investment securities and the definition of investment securities according to the courts in this country has always been instruments that are designed in a form which permits their public treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.646" offset="11058573">The suggestions of the Solicitor were accepted and we find Appendix B defining certificates of indebtedness as instruments having the general character of investment securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.016" offset="11120013">That definition was done a way with in 1941 when the 1941 regulations came out, and it if the 1941 regulation just stated that instruments having the essential characteristics of bonds, or certificate of indebtedness, or debentures would be taxed as such, however, I submit the essential characteristics of certificates of indebtedness, or that they be in a form convenient for trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.110" offset="11216353">I'd also like to say that I object to that contention of the Government even being considered in view of the fact that it wasn't raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.153" offset="11252611">It wasn't even mentioned in denying the claim for refund or a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.702" offset="11270792">It was mentioned in passing before the Court of Appeals but never pressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.853" offset="11483324">The terms are too high and that there might be -- excuse me -- the denomination is too high to permit they're readily been able to get rid of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.600" offset="11518328">So at such time was the insurance companies want dollars instead of pieces of paper or they would have to have entirely new instruments created so that they would be in a position to trade their new instruments for dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.115" offset="11572454">And at such time as these new instruments are created, certainly, they have debentures and a tax should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.163" offset="11604637">But that is not to stay that a tax should be imposed on original documents because Congress was clearly concerned with taxing documents already in existence not hypothetical ones which may or may not come into existence in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.059" offset="11668167">To say that that provision makes these instruments taxable, it's like saying that if a group of partners agreed that on a future contingency, they may or may not form a corporation that they now have to start paying the corporate income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.413" offset="11745593">If anything, I believe that provision aids our case and that it demonstrates in concrete form a right within the corners of the documents themselves and the differences between promissory notes, the type we have and debentures on the other hand, the types of instruments Congress intended to tax.</text>
