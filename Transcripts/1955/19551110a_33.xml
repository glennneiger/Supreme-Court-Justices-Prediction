            <label>Mr. Stephen J. D'Arcy, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.927" offset="47647">May it please the Court, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.406" offset="53603">This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.835" offset="87249">The question was limited as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.137" offset="100519">Does the Labor Management Relations Act oust state courts of jurisdiction of a suit by a railroad to enjoin a union and union representatives from engaging in peaceably conducted strikes or attempts to undo such strikes by the employees of interstate motor carriers for the purpose of persuading such carriers to agree to restrict their use of interstate railroad transportation facilities and to give some portion of such interstate carriage work to their employees who are all represented by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.413" offset="225593">Now, the respondent railroad company is a common carrier by rail subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.943" offset="267703">Since approximately December of 1937, this particular railroad has engaged in the operation of hauling flatcars loaded with truck trailers of the type ordinarily hauled over the highways by a motor truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.201" offset="328725">The operation is known in the trade and popularly as piggy-backing.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.069" offset="348264">This operation is carried on between several cities in New England and New York, principally Boston to New York and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.095" offset="384313">The petitioner union is the collective bargaining representative of drivers and helpers, employed by motor carriers in the Boston area and has collective bargaining agreements with those motor carriers who operate from the Boston area.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.424" offset="445649">The union does not represent any employees of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.500" offset="461949">The individual petitioners are officers and representatives of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.171" offset="484624">The process of piggy-backing is accomplished in the Boston area by having loaded trailers drawn by motor trucks to the railroad yard, known as Yard 5 in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.657" offset="534570">Those trucks are operated by employees of motor carriers who are the members of this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.685" offset="566648">There, the trailers are driven or rather taken by mechanical devices by employees of a railroad subsidiary, the New England Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.040" offset="604160">That transportation company is a trucking company and subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.273" offset="649091">Those employees of New England Transportation are also represented by the same union and the union has a contract with that same New England Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.305" offset="685140">Those employees then take the trailers and put them on the flatcars from which point railroad employees, specifically, railroad employees, tie the so-called trailer on to the flatcars so that it can be hauled.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.561" offset="742191">For some years as the state court had found here, the union had been disturbed about piggy-backing because it felt that the practice diminished the opportunities of employment of the members of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.804" offset="795167">During the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements with the motor carriers from 1946 up through the contract which was in effect at the time this action commenced, the union had made proposals which would have tendered to restrict the haulage of these trailers on the piggy-back system.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.356" offset="885342">The evidence in the record discloses that the union had made such a proposal and finally -- ultimately those contractual proposals did not appear in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.795" offset="935079">After the contracts were -- were agreed upon, discussions and negotiations continued between the union and various individual motor carriers as appears in the record and they came to individual agreements respecting the shipment and the number of trailers to be shipped through their system.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.822" offset="1003207">Those agreements were not uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.707" offset="1010730">They were diverse depending upon the particular carrier the union negotiated with.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.778" offset="1563063">Not particularly, as I say -- as I started to say, sir, the union had raised an issue that under a particular clause in the contract, it prohibited the shipment of these trailers on flatcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.160" offset="1608620">That -- that was an issue which had been raised and the state court found that the contract did not prohibit the shipment of these trailers on the flatcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.468" offset="1645819">Now, on July 11th of 1952, two business representatives of the union appeared at -- on the street outside of Yard 5 of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.464" offset="1685838">And as the original state court trial decision found on a preliminary injunction proceeding, they hailed and signaled drivers of the motor carriers and persuaded them not to enter upon the rail yard premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.299" offset="1745189">As the later trial judge at the hearing on the merits and as affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court, the activity was found to constitute picketing of the railroad yard and inducement of the New England Transportation Company employees not to engage in their ordinary work in order that the railroad might be forced to stop doing business with the motor carriers and also to force the motor carriers to stop doing business with the railroad and therein does the conflict lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.562" offset="1862217">They persuaded also as they say according to the state court findings, the New England employees not to -- not to engage in their ordinary work.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.802" offset="1903177">The case came on up through the state court after several hearings on injunction then the merits and then before the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.938" offset="1939749">It is the contention of the union that the activities of which the railroad complained and has set forth in their bill of complaint their substitute bill of complaint and their amended substitute bill of complaint in the state court proceedings clearly accused the union of committing an unfair labor practice under the so-called Taft-Hartley or Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.259" offset="2037029">The state court found that we claim to have permitted such unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.174" offset="2056673">What we had claimed was that the state court had found we engaged in such unfair labor practices, and that brings us to another issue as to whether or not the picketing was primary as to the motor carriers whether or not it was secondary as to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.803" offset="2115187">And the whole problem of whether or not reasonably upon reading the pleadings that, the bill of complaint and the defendant's answers in the state court, this is within the doctrine of the Weber and the Garner cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.931" offset="2163670">The Weber against Anheuser-Busch and Garner against Teamsters Union in which Garner of course holds that where the acts complained to have constituted an unfair labor practices -- unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.627" offset="2226469">Clearly, a state court is without jurisdiction to also enjoin such activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.191" offset="2244754">The original primary and exclusive jurisdiction is with the National Labor Relations Board who administratively under the statute has set up procedures for the expeditious -- most expeditious and priority handling of such type of charges through to the mandatory injunction processes before federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.755" offset="2334929">It is the position of the union that their activity was protected under Section 7 of the Labor Management Relations Act because it was in furtherance of collective bargaining or attempts to collectively bargain with the motor carriers and get them to come to some type of agreement or let's agree that we have come to no agreement at least to induce collective bargaining in good faith upon that respect -- with respect to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.940" offset="2475677">Within the doctrine of Weber against Anheuser-Busch, it should have been viewed by the state court that all these proceedings and the acts complained of by the railroad petitioner there ought reasonably to be within that area of labor relations which the National Act is designed to administer and determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.430" offset="2561672">Since the brief was prepared, I have come across in respect to the railroad's position they claim that the railroad could not go to the National Labor Relations Board by virtue of the International Rice Milling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.581" offset="2618305">I might point out in connection with the International Rice Milling case that no railroad filed a charge in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.731" offset="2638890">The charge was filed by a milling company.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.922" offset="2647667">And my understanding is that the Labor Relations Board permitted the railroad to participate as amicus curiae in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.467" offset="2673789">When the case came here, that issue as to whether or not a railroad is an employer under the so-called Taft-Hartley was not raised here by the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.307" offset="2705136">And it had been found by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the railroad was such an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.213" offset="2728751">Our contention is that it does not matter whether the railroad is an employer within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (4), the so-called secondary boycott provision of the Taft-Hartley law.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.334" offset="2769293">The question is whether or not they are a person or whether or not the Board has jurisdiction over the party who was claimed to have committed this unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.381" offset="2809522">Going further, the Board has recently held in a non-reported decision and I provided the clerk with certified -- a certified copy of the decision plus other copies on August 30th of this year involving the Kohler Company and United Automobile Workers of the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.468" offset="2873783">I think we're probably all familiar with the fact there has been a -- a long standing labor dispute and strike and picketing by the UAW of the Kohler Company and that in accordance with the Board's complaint, they alleged that the union engaged in unlawful secondary boycott activities under 8 (b) (4) (A) of Taft-Hartley by picketing the City of Milwaukee that ran docking facilities and by picketing the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, who was alleged in the General Counsel's complaint to be a railroad employer just as the New Haven Railroad here subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission, prior to them and under the Act prior to one and also to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.416" offset="3037623">The Board's order -- ordered the union to seize picketing, that employer confined its picketing to Kohler.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.254" offset="3064999">I point that out to show that the contention that if a charge had been filed by a railroad with the National Labor Relations Board, it would have been processed by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.267" offset="3105019">The Board's rules and the Act itself on Section 10 only provide that when it has charged, that when a person charges an unfair labor practice, the law of the case does not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.089" offset="3144307">It doesn't matter who files the particular charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.248" offset="3176908">Now, my brother has also contended that in approaching the application of the Railway Labor Act to this case as did Mr. Justice Ronan in the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.944" offset="3235736">The conclusion was that the railroad was subject to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.019" offset="3252036">Railroad employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act and all their relationships with each other are subject to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.333" offset="3285264">Therefore, the railroad has nothing to do with the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.932" offset="3299683">But the activities complained of in this particular case do not involve any relationship between railroads and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.985" offset="3327896">There is no finding nor had -- nor was there any accusation that the union induced railroad employees to do something or to refrain from doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.103" offset="3360392">All the activity was directed to the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.813" offset="3379200">Under the leading cases now, it can still be argued very disputably as to whether or not the particular picketing engaged in by the union agents was primary or was secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.512" offset="3429982">And I think those were the precise problems which this Court has pointed out within the area of the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board in the first instance in order -- and to be tried in state courts or not to be brought here and determine here on proceedings arising out of state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.910" offset="3507618">Now, the brunt of the railroad's argument then shifts to the averment that the activity in which the union agents engaged was not protected by Section 7 of the law and therefore was within the doctrine of the International Union UAW against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, the Briggs Stratton case, were based upon the state court findings, this Court determined that total intermittent stoppages or unannounced ends were not protected activity under Section 7 of the Taft-Hartley law.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.052" offset="3660173">We do not have in this situation total intermittent stoppages for unannounced purposes as we plead in the record, as we have carefully cited in the brief just what the purpose of the picketing was as the Court found it to be picketing, it was not unstated purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.978" offset="3727882">The aims were always clear and known to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.463" offset="3741780">The railroad also claims that this activity being ambulatory picketing was not protected under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.723" offset="3778873">But in establishing even if that were true that this is ambulatory picketing and therefore unprotected, they are establishing that what it is, is a violation of Section 8 (b) (4) which brings the case clearly within the Garner doctrine again.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.816" offset="3839164">They claimed that the activity is unprotected because it was a breach of contract and they cite the Mead case in which the same union was also involved and the Mead case stands for the proposition that if there was a breach of contract under Section 301 of Taft-Hartley, an employer may go to court and sue because of that breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.965" offset="3911784">We admit that those possibilities were available here if they were a breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.843" offset="3931324">I don't think it can be established upon this record that they were a breach because it cannot be established on this record that the dispute concerning the flat car hauling of loaded trailers was a dispute or agreements which were subject to the arbitration agreements procedure under the contract then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.404" offset="4017528">They say that the purpose then of the stoppage was to breach the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.135" offset="4036441">Well, the only purpose it could've had if it were breach in the contract would have been to demand from the employer motor carriers a modification of that contract insofar as it did not govern the relationships concerning these flatcars and the flat car hauling of trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.979" offset="4115853">Carrying that one step further, it would be a clear violation of Section 8 (d) of the Taft-Hartley law which requires that no labor organization or employer either shall engage in a strike or a lockout for the purpose of terminating or modifying any agreement without first having giving 60 days notice to the other party and then within 30 days thereafter in giving notice to the federal and the state mediation and conciliation services in order to avoid the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.319" offset="4229224">Thus clearly, if the purpose were to modify the contract, it would be a violation of 8 (d) and very likely then also a violation of 8 (b) (3) by virtue of which the union would be engaging and bargaining in bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.145" offset="7204571">In other words, an attempt to produce a violation of the National Labor Relations Act does not in and of itself amount to an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.949" offset="7235709">Under Massachusetts' statute, such an act constitutes a violation of Massachusetts' law and takes the action outside the protective ambit of the anti-injunction law of Massachusetts so that one might properly say an attempt to commit a -- to procure a commission of an unfair labor practice without necessarily giving jurisdiction to the Board because the Board never has jurisdiction unless it has charged that a violation has actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.935" offset="7335706">The attempt to produce a violation is not the concomitant or the equivalent of a commission of an unfair labor practice sufficient to oust the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.845" offset="7367367">But I go further, Your Honors, I respectfully suggest that this case involves only the question as to whether or not the action of the union constituted a protected concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.622" offset="7414387">My brother has said in the courts below, he has repeated in his brief and we have argued that there is no secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.517" offset="7446047">The facts here do not require the preliminary investigation of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.603" offset="7462348">It does not require the expertise of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.273" offset="7473006">There are matters of law of which the state court under federal court are equally competent to judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.346" offset="7497352">Now, there are three fundamental facts which I suggest form a framework for the analysis of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.399" offset="7521593">First, since 1937, motor carriers have engaged in the piggy-back operation my adversary has described and the railroad has made a very substantial investment in that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.899" offset="7563494">Since that day, many, many railroads invested many millions of dollars in precisely the same form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.168" offset="7588571">For many years there was a collective bargaining agreement between the motor carriers and the petitioner union which never prohibited piggy-back operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.233" offset="7624829">And answering Mr. Justice Reed, New England Transportation is a motor carrier like every other motor carrier, the bulk of its business consists in the transportation of vehicles over the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.380" offset="7665476">It has a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission and although it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the New Haven Railroad, it carries on wholly independent operations including flat car service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.343" offset="7709362">It is true, a very limited portion of its work consist in the riding of a trailer up a ramp onto the flat car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.324" offset="7737260">A various limited number of its men are employed in that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.909" offset="7751576">And I might point out, the dispute did to involve the driving of the trailers up the ramp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.871" offset="7775399">The dispute involved the objective of the union to eliminate or at least to limit the transportation of trailers by flat car.So that wasn't a dispute, N. E. T. is not a -- is not a secondary employer or a neutral employer in this case, N. E. T. is a primary employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.342" offset="7925342">That is the alleged primary dispute and my brother falls into this error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.987" offset="7943941">He equates Section 7 with what are proper bargainable demands.Section 7 is a compound of means and objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.527" offset="7978005">What might be a perfectly proper objective may lose the protection of Section 7 if the means are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.663" offset="8002560">For example, one may properly strike for higher wages, but a strike in violation of an existing collective bargaining agreement is not protected under Section 7 as the Court said in the (Inaudible) case and Your Honors approved in the Briggs Stratton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.860" offset="8063373">So that the dispute -- the objective of the dispute, the objective which may be bargainable and we don't reach this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.606" offset="8094407">And I dare say that I think I can establish that any agreement between the motor carriers and the employees to limit the use of flatcars might run a foul of the Allen-Bradley principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.150" offset="8136516">It might be an elicit arrangement to engage in a monopoly of transportation, but I don't think we reach that question because what is paramount here is that the locus of the activity was not primary that what the motor carrier employees attempted to do was not to strike the motor carriers at their easily accessible terminals in -- in Boston, but they carried their picket line to a secondary situs and then therein lies the absence of protected activity under Section 7 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.897" offset="8259500">Now, what they did was this, by establishing a picket line in front of the premises of the railroad, they shut down the railroad's facilities, thereby prevented the railroad from providing the service, thereby prevented the motor carriers from getting the service and in that manner, attempted to resolve their alleged primary dispute with the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.803" offset="8343197">And I suggest that this conduct poses this very important and unsettled question and the only question I think before the Court whether employees, having a dispute with their employer, are engaged in a concerted activity within the meaning of Section 7 when the picketing is restricted exclusively to the premises of a neutral party in an effort to force the neutral party to cease doing business with the primary employer and in that attempt, in that way attempt to resolve their primary dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.156" offset="10432575">But I suggest further even if the Board is wrong in International Rice Milling, even if the Board has changed its policy and will take jurisdiction of a case involving a railroad, I suggest that the legislators never intended that railroads be subject to any part of the benefits or the restrictions of the Act, and I should like to take 10 minutes to develop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.733" offset="10522854">I should like to summarily state with Your Honors' permission that where activity is withdrawn from the primary area of dispute and transferred exclusively to a secondary locus, you have secondary activity which was not intended to be protected under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.198" offset="10596728">In this case you also have a question of partial strikes, intermittent strikes, a strike and violation of on agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.779" offset="10623060">This Court has repeatedly held that this is not a protected activity, the Sands case and so on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.174" offset="10648660">Furthermore, if the argument which is advanced that an act not prohibited by 8 (b) (4) is a fortiori protected by 7 is adopted, then it means that the very thing that concerted activities has intended to produce, a collective bargaining agreement may be broken with impunity and the parties engaged in the breach of the contract are protected under Section 7 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.128" offset="10736431">Such a construction would be obviously self-defeating, I think there's no question that this activity was not primary, and I think the only question which is open for discussion is the question Your Honor has raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.492" offset="10913959">I respectfully submit that's the only question I am obliged to answer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.587" offset="10930260">When the case comes up involving questions of 8 (b) (4) then I think I'll answer that, but I shall just like to address myself to the question of the railroad's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.292" offset="10973100">Section 2, which contains the definitions, expressly excludes a railroad as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.627" offset="10998491">Section 2, I think its subdivision 3 which defines employees similarly and by express language excludes employees employed by a railroad.Now, this is interesting to observe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.978" offset="11047811">Under the original Wagner Act, the railroads were expressly excluded from the definition of employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.705" offset="11078740">When the Wagner Act was amended, Congress in order to avoid the remote and improbable possibility that railroad employees might be embraced under the terms of the statute, specifically wrote into the law the definition of employees, the language not to include employee subject to the -- to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.370" offset="11181453">Now, under the Wagner Act, the Board never assumed jurisdiction over railroads or railroad employees and there's a good reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.983" offset="11219905">The Railway Labor Act is one of longer standing than the Wagner Act that it proved a salutary piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.396" offset="11245505">It too has an administrative machinery to test collective bargaining agreement certification and indeed in case of national strikes and emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.076" offset="11284271">Congress never thought it necessary to set up a procedure for dealing with secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.809" offset="11303184">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.763" offset="11307050">Because the railroads have traditionally been accorded special statutory treatment, the railroads were not under the same restrictions and inhibitions as most businessman and were able to get relief from the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.345" offset="11353339">Now, we have to conclude that Congress secretly and by implication intended to cover railroads and Your Honor said in one of your opinion, if one cannot see the plain meaning in a statute and surely the statute is not clear, it is full of dark places, I respectfully submit that, then one looks to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.725" offset="11434841">And the debates on the House and the debates in the Senate demonstrate inclusively that the Act was never intended to be applied to railroads at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.859" offset="11471412">I think Senator Taft, in response to a question put to him by Senator Morse at the time said, "Of course not, railroad labor is always been covered by the Railway Labor Act and we don't intend to cover it under the 8 (b) violation which included the cause of that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.956" offset="11535778">Now, there's one other clue which is I think very significant, in order to bring the railroads within the framework of this Act, one must have a piecemeal application, one must assume that Congress not only was unsophisticated, it was irrational because there are at least five instances in which it would be impossible to apply this Act to railroads and a railroad would be a direct dictum of the secondary boycott and have no remedy, not before the Board and not in the Court perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.855" offset="11655419">For example, if a railroad union were to induce railroad employees to engage in a strike for prohibited objects as defined in 8 (b) (4) (A), you could not have a secondary boycott by definition because a railroad union is not a labor organization under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.438" offset="11717695">Contrary wise and despite the ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, if there was an inducement of employees of a railroad to engage in a strike, you could not have it because the employees of a railroad are not employees within the meaning of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.987" offset="11771925">You cannot have a violation of 8 (b) (D) because there you will trench on the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.103" offset="11804317">The assignment of work which is the end-product of a proceeding in 8 (b) (D), where the Board says there's a jurisdictional dispute, I assign the work to Union A, is manifestly impossible because that kind of an adjudication can only be made by National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.549" offset="11866175">Now, how then is a railroad brought within the compass of this Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.986" offset="11879863">In one situation, the Board in the International Rice Milling said, first, when Congress said the employees of any employer in the A part of 8 (b) (4), it meant any employer irrespective of the definition, then that's an absurdity because Section 10 which deals with the prevention of unfair labor practices says that when any person commits an unfair labor practice as defined in Section 158, a charge may be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.318" offset="11985189">Well, any person can include a railroad there because a railroad can never commit an unfair labor practice under Section 8 (a) which is the employer unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.537" offset="12022073">Now, when the unfair labor practices were included for union, railroad unions were expressly excluded just as railroad employers were excluded from Section 8, the employer unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.012" offset="12072020">Now, in this one remote case, where a railroad is a victim of a secondary boycott, it is suggested that the railroad must then pursue the remedies before the Board because in all other cases its position is worse, not better, but worse than every other employer because you can never be the victim of a direct secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.601" offset="12146312">Now, this would be a foolish way to write a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.686" offset="12158642">It would not only be bad draftsmanship, it would be impossible of application and construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.920" offset="12167628">It would mean, as I've said in my brief, that you'd have two acts like tenancy in common jointly occupying one field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.838" offset="12203259">There is no such doctrine of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.955" offset="12211722">Now, I confess to some difficulty, I've had considerable difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.257" offset="12228963">And the difficulty is this, it may well be that there is a remedy in the Board when the railroad is a victim of a secondary boycott as it may have been in this case conceivably, it may have a remedy in the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.936" offset="12283716">I suggest that the doctrine of preemption does not grow out of the existence of a remedy, it grows out of language which expressly says we occupy the entire field or there's a congressional intention to occupy the entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.743" offset="12334916">Now, it's true perhaps that the railroad could have filed a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.063" offset="12348186">It is also true that the United States of America can file a charge but would anyone suggest that the United States of America, in order to protect itself from a secondary boycott, must file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.443" offset="12397714">The Board said no in surprise and made a very silly distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.747" offset="12410984">They said it was based on the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.190" offset="12420702">But in the Sherman Act, in the Maritime Act, in a host of other regulatory statutes, the word "person" has been construed to apply to United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.123" offset="12460408">I suggest that an interpretation which would require a railroad to go to the Labor Board in the one instance would make this candidly as this law incapable of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.316" offset="12501264">I suggest that the intention of the Congress in enacting the Taft-Hartley was not to bring railroads within the compass of the Act or to make it subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.765" offset="12543060">I suggest that Congress intended at all times that where a railroad was impeded in the performance of its common carrier duties, the railroad could have recourse to the Court and many District Courts have so held.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.424" offset="12953600">I don't think that this kind of a case particularly calls for the technical knowledge, the skill, the expertise of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.226" offset="12980872">And I suggest further, Anheuser-Busch did one more thing, it pointed out that the Garner case -- the dictum in Garner case suggested by the late Justice Jackson that wherever interstate commerce was involved, you necessarily had preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.664" offset="13034580">It's suggested by the three categories of cases that if the matter was not covered by the Act or protected, not prohibited, then the state would be free to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.031" offset="13072091">Now, I submit that a state court is competent to decide, to give an action in the light of the persistent denials, remember that my pleadings weren't the only papers before the Court, my very able adversary not only denied the allegation, the conclusory allegation but he joined in my motion to conform the pleadings to the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.531" offset="13146070">The proof never established a secondary boycott and the mere fact that I plead badly, the mere fact I asked for relief I'm not entitled to does not bind a court in the light of the evidence as educed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.148" offset="13228513">A complaint was filed in a federal court and Judge Wyzanski said, "Oh, I can't give you relief under the Labor Management Act because a railroad is not an employer."</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.436" offset="13265711">I respectfully submit that the complaint was bad for other reasons but in any event Judge Wyzanski did suggest that we could not claim relief under the Labor Management Relations Act because the railroad is not an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.791" offset="13455151">We started with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.245" offset="13460898">I confess that from time to time amendments were made to the pleadings but they were conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.269" offset="13481064">They were abandoned in the course of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.045" offset="13488170">We moved to conform the pleadings to the proof, the only case before the Court and the only case that was brought to this Court on the petition for writ of certiorari was whether this activity was protected and therefore the state court was ousted of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.123" offset="13540415">I respectfully conclude by saying that I do not believe these activities were concerted nor protected under Section 7 and the judgment should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.589" offset="13606348">I -- I should like to point out to the Court that enjoining and the motion as -- as my brother suggested to conform the pleadings to the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.163" offset="13640620">That was a traditional motion as I understood it at the time to correct dates, times, places, names, spelling things of that nature which is why I get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.263" offset="13669042">As a matter of fact, the first time he cites my joining in into that motion was that the conclusion of a hearing with respect to a preliminary injunction and he even filed that pleading at that stage and that's why the motion was joined in that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.146" offset="13724526">I don't think in any event that such a motion to change the entire picture of the theory of the case, both as it was tried in Massachusetts and as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court determined the case, mind you pointing out that with respect to the secondary boycott allegations with respect to 8 (b) (4) (A), the Supreme Court of Massachusetts found that we had engaged in such a violation with respect to the New England Transportation Company who is subject to the National Act.</text>
