            <label>Mr. James F. Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="10.183" offset="40647">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.259" offset="52976">Yesterday, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me where in the record the Assistant Attorney General had indicated that he believe that if the judge granted an injunction of what constitute a modification of the decree, that colloquy will be found at page 6 of the record and I think that in conjunction with that, in fairness, you should read what Mr. Karsted later said at page 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.946" offset="191739">That was the second hearing, and while on the -- at the first hearing, he felt that the -- an injunction would constitute on unwarranted modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.460" offset="229773">After he returned home to Washington, he changed his mind and then informed the Court that he thought that an injunction would not constitute a modification, and it's at page 36 that he so informed the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="295184">Now, before proceeding with my argument, I would also like to refer to a -- a portion of the record which I think bears upon the question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked yesterday as to what implications could be drawn with respect to Liquid's consent to the decree, and I said that such implications could be drawn as only we're consistent with a limited language used in Section 9 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="106.652" offset="426527">And I said further that I thought that the district judge had no power to resort to the philosophy of the Sherman Act or the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.832" offset="467278">And down at -- at -- fully on 53, in the middle of the page, page 29, the judge asked me, “Was the purpose of that,” that is of Section 9 (e), “to furnish new competition in an area whereby agreement between the parties,” it was determined not decided, “but determined that Liquid exercised a degree of monopoly,” and I rejected that contention and said that no such inference could be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.103" offset="596323">But nevertheless, that is the inference that the judge drew that we had been found guilty of a violation of the Sherman Act and I express again that there is no basis whatever for any such deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.334" offset="737280">I think in large part, that followed the usual kind of decree that the Government asked the defendant to sign, except at various places where modifications occurred and Section 9 (e) is one of them, those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.289" offset="809064">Now, as I was saying yesterday, the -- the Court rationalized its order in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.396" offset="845531">It said that the purpose of the consent decree was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.469" offset="861832">First, to divest Liquid of its plants and secondly to bring competition into the area and opposition of course was that the purpose of this Section of the decree was to bring a competitor into the area and that we can send it to sell our plants on the assumption that the Government would find a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.950" offset="975726">Although, we had pointed out, and this appears in the record, to the district judge that we have reminded the United States and reminded the judge in the course of the -- the negotiations on the consent decree, that in our opinion, these plants would not be bought by anybody who would operate them as to CO2 manufacturing plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.544" offset="1078126">So, really, what was involved here when the decree was submitted was a contention on our side that these plants would not be sold but let -- we were willing to take the risk on our judgment on that point against the Government's insistence that they should have an opportunity to bring a competitor into the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.859" offset="2103380">He was kept informed that we were having these negotiations and some of them took place in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.398" offset="2129502">And from time to time, he asked us a reason for insisting on this or refusing to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.681" offset="2166700">But when the decree was presented to him, so far as I can now recall, he -- he signed the decree as -- as a Pro Forma Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.947" offset="2215706">Now, the judge -- the judge said, “Well, since I can't compel a sale of the plant under this decree, I'll do the next best thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.378" offset="2293447">I'll stop you from using it, and in that way, we will have achieved one of the purposes of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.874" offset="2327406">Then, we will put Liquid out of business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="585.890" offset="2343497">And now, any -- his decree has brought enough as I said yesterday to prevent us from using the plant for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.156" offset="2384562">We were in effect compelled to sell that plant as quickly as we can to avoid the cost of maintenance of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.923" offset="2415595">So, he -- he then entered an order which he said, “Your enjoined from using this plant and I'll deny the Government's motion for an order of sale without prejudice to a renewal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="628.362" offset="2513398">Now, the reasoning, it seems to me, becomes more involved on the judge's part, because in the first place, he said, “I can't compel a sale under this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.951" offset="2551745">I have no power, but I'm going to imply that -- draw the inference that I can require association of use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.574" offset="2586227">And then, I asked him why.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.053" offset="2596153">He gave a Government leave to renew a motion, to put an order of sale when he's denied it, and his reasoning run this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.026" offset="2632098">He said, “Well, the Government has said in a brief that an injunction might involve it in a -- in a difficulty of policing, see that we're obeying it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="670.409" offset="2681626">And he said, “So, I then decided that if you didn't obey, they should have a right to come in here and ask me for an order of sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="681.724" offset="2726870">In other words, he deemed it that and within his power of punishing for a contempt, should we disobey this order which had not yet been ended, that he could compel to us sell the plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="695.090" offset="2780264">The power which I think can't be found in -- in the equity powers of the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.855" offset="2811402">Now, it is our position that no searching for sustenance of power such as he endeavor to find here, going to the pleadings, going to the philosophy of the Sherman Act is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.334" offset="2877336">And we say that such an attempt is in -- it -- it contradicts the language of this Court in the Ford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.106" offset="2924356">Your Honors will probably recall that in the Ford case, Ford had agreed to disaffiliate itself with a finance company, on condition that the Government should within a specified time compel General Motors likewise to disaffiliate, and a consent decree was entered on that basis by the Government and Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.092" offset="3040340">And for years, thereafter, the Government let lay a -- an action in the federal court against General Motors, didn't prosecute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.685" offset="3094674">And in Ford, a mode in -- in the District Court for an order releasing it from the shackles of this restraint that had been placed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.849" offset="3139396">The district judge denied its motion, gave the Government more time and this Court reversed the -- the District Court and required an order to be entered releasing Ford from the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.574" offset="3194253">And in connection with that release, this Court said that the district judge had no power to resort to the allegations of the complaint, because there, the district judge said, “Well, Ford in effect is -- is guilty of a -- of a violation of the Sherman Act,” but this Court said, “No such finding is permissible, because the decree was a consent decree.” That's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.160" offset="3296549">There's no finding that we have violated the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.945" offset="3331762">Now, I would like briefly to go over the subsections of -- of this Section 9 (e) to show, Your Honors, that there is no possibility of an implication of a right to issue an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.533" offset="3418070">Now, that -- that consent decree is in the record at -- what page is that one?</text>

            <text syncTime="885.718" offset="3542831">Now, it's not worthy that the plants includes not merely real-estate buildings and production equipment, but also production and sales records, which indicates that the plant was to be sold to somebody who would come in and operate it for purposes of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.359" offset="3609391">And subsection 2 provides that the plants shall be sold through a trustee forthwith.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.993" offset="3635931">Now, terms of office were to be one year with the right of the Court to extend it, whenever a showing was made that there may be persons who have an interest in operating the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.709" offset="3690789">As I said, his time was extended and he was unable to find anybody who would operate the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.693" offset="3710746">Section -- subdivision 3 is designed to protect us from his for sale at an adequate price and as you will see, to bring a new competitor into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.939" offset="3751706">It provides that the purchase price shall have a -- do regard for the evaluation made by the Court appraiser and that the plant shall not be sold to anybody who is connected with this defendant or with any of the other defendants in the action and -- and only to a person who will operate the plant for CO2 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.988" offset="3831850">And subdivision 4 requires us to maintain the plants at our customary standards until sold by the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.141" offset="3868526">Now, the judge -- now, the -- the Government of course insisted that -- that a sale of this plant would have the effect of -- of precluding us from selling or from operating within this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.905" offset="3947520">That's the very basis upon which this order is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.852" offset="3963402">Yet, that is a -- a truly erroneous conception because if the judge has power to enjoin us, then under Section 9 (g) of this decree, we can instantly commence the construction of a new and larger plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.848" offset="4047308">So, obviously, it wasn't the purpose of this decree to put us out of the carbon dioxide business in these two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.924" offset="4087641">The main -- the purpose and the real purpose was to bring a competitor into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.358" offset="4105404">Otherwise, why would Section 9 (g) permit us to come in and build a new plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.877" offset="4135497">Now, the -- the decree or the order of the judge in this case, also is in contradiction to this Court's decision in the Hughes case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.993" offset="4823876">And it makes very clear that the parties themselves consented to appropriate modifications, appropriate constructions, appropriate orders -- orders for carrying out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.553" offset="4986149">And I would think that an appropriate modification or construction was one which fell within the initial consent of the parties, but since the decree itself is based upon the consent of the Government and the defendant in the case, the modifications must in turn the based upon that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.487" offset="5065874">And so, it must fall within the scope of the initial consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.793" offset="5091161">Turning from that, I turn to the Section which is directly involved in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.994" offset="5115925">That's 9 (e) of the decree which appears at page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.582" offset="5142256">I may say that this is a suit which was brought against this defendant and several other defendants who are manufacturing carbon dioxide and dry ice, alleging monopoly and restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.070" offset="5200248">And with respect to this defendant, it was specifically alleged that Liquid Carbonic, one of the -- one of the actions complained of was that Liquid Carbonic had acquired a certain number of additional plants leading to monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.673" offset="5258658">So, it was -- it was natural that in the decree, there should be provisions for divestiture of -- of some of these plants which was alleged had resulted monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.800" offset="5299200">Section 9 (e) deals with that particular subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.885" offset="5311530">It starts of by providing that within one year from the date of the entry of the final judgment, “Defendant Liquid shall,” pursuant to the terms and conditions of this subsection (e), “dispose of as complete units its existing plants at Long Island City in New York and Indianapolis, Indiana, a divestiture provision, a provision that they should get rid of these plants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.674" offset="5414661">But not consent -- not content with merely honoring divestiture as a finished twist to this particular section of the -- of the consent decree which required not only that they divest themselves of these plants but that they sell them to potential competitors so that there could be active competition in these particular areas unless a reduction of the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.904" offset="5523540">And that provision contained in Section 3, subsection (3) of this 9 (e) which states that the trustee shall dispose of these plants to persons who will manufacture on carbon dioxide and dry ice or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.292" offset="5601071">In other words, an attempt was made to force the defendant to sell to competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.781" offset="5631060">Now, as Mr. Dwyer has told you during the year and a half following the decree, the trustee was unable to make this decision of these plants in accordance with Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.384" offset="5677453">Unfortunately, the decree couldn't say what was going to happen when that -- when that occurred.</text>
