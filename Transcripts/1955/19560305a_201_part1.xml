            <label>Mr. William B. Murrish</label>
            <text syncTime="39.696" offset="158720">And it is a -- a cause in habeas corpus to review a final order for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.406" offset="205531">The substantive basis for deportation was a charge under the 1950 amendment to the 1917 Immigration Act for charged membership after entry in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.414" offset="285571">This deportation more than many affects the liberty and life of the individual in sharp manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.402" offset="345548">This man is 39 or 40 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.110" offset="360385">He came to the United States lawfully, entered it lawfully, and has resided here ever since the childhood age of seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.461" offset="405838">He knows no other land, he knows no other language, he is married to a citizen, he has two children, both sons, both citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.400" offset="469577">To him, deportation means a separation in the words of the Ng Fung Ho case of all that makes life worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.549" offset="530181">And before I reach the nub of the issue in the case, I would make one further point about the special circumstances here and that concerns itself with the place of deportations specified in the warrant and the record, namely, Korea and the circumstance that in the record in this cause, the alien established to the administrative service and made evidence of circumstances which are so known historically as to also lie within the area of judicial knowledge, namely, the jeopardy to life or of even physical persecution should deportation of a person critical of the regime of Syngman Rhee in Korea placed him within the physical control of that nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.333" offset="817319">We have, therefore, the -- in human terms, the most serious consequence to an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.531" offset="866116">Now, I don't pretend that consequence alone controls anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.452" offset="889731">A death case in criminal law also involved the most extreme consequence but it does lay the premises upon which we reach the basic law question of the cause which is a question of the quality and content of procedural due process of law in such a deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.971" offset="1007804">The question factually, I believe, may be very briefly described.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.601" offset="1038315">The alien, at the time of his hearing, was physically in the custody of the Immigration Service in confinement in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.078" offset="1084291">His hearing was conducted in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.857" offset="1095367">However, at the very outset of his hearing, and everything I say is included in our very brief record here and I will simply paraphrase it in -- in my opening statement, in the early moments of the hearing after no more than the opening preliminaries and questions going to alienage only and after merely discussions of question of a continuance, a motion was made to take depositions of four witnesses in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.077" offset="1236219">And as developed, these four witnesses were called in Hawaii and did give their statements in deposition form and this was the soul and only evidence introduced of the substantive basis of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.600" offset="1346351">Now, at the proceedings held in Hawaii, the -- the alien defendant was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.781" offset="1399118">He was in jail in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.334" offset="1413329">Neither was he present or represented by counsel either the counsel representing him in Los Angeles or any other counsel appearing in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.671" offset="1470589">That is simply factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.259" offset="1476963">There was no one present in Hawaii except the service and its examining officer and the witnesses.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Murrish</label>
            <text syncTime="392.015" offset="1567974">Your Honor, there was a reference at the outset of the depositions which appear at the very end of the transcript does in exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.750" offset="1610919">There was a reference by the hearing officer to the fact that an attorney had called him and had said that he had been -- this attorney had said that he had been asked to consider appearing for the alien and that he had been instructed not to so appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.517" offset="1678002">It later appears in the record when the depositions were offered into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.399" offset="1701512">It is stated by counsel for the record that although it was considered having counsel other than Los Angeles counsel appear in Hawaii without the attendance of the alien that it was concluded that this was impractical, I believe, in counsels where he said impossible that he would not be able adequately to handle the representation without conference and presence of the alien and he was no such counsel was authorized to appear for him and no counsel did appear for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.378" offset="1853440">Although, I think, it is correct to say that it was contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.796" offset="1875174">As a matter of fact, there are several points in the record where it is shown that the alien having once made request for the basic rights which I will argue for of his right to be there himself in present during his hearing and to have his own attorney be present with him that less than that he did consider alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.284" offset="1973081">He did consider whether that being denied, he might submit written interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.777" offset="1999099">He did consider whether he might have counsel other than his own in Hawaii appeared for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.463" offset="2025848">I suppose he may have canvassed in his mind some other conceivable alternatives to him none other than the basic ones which were not granted to him appeared to have the meat and substance to furnish an adequate opportunity and he, therefore, did not resort to either written interrogatories nor did he attempt to have counsel appeared for him in Hawaii without his consultation or his presence.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.469" offset="2189793">Mr. Murrish, why, if -- if you know, did not, the Government, take the main hearing of this case to Hawaii?</text>

            <text syncTime="558.201" offset="2232738">Well, Your Honor, I'll be very frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.780" offset="2243082">I am counsel on appeal and I did not know until I saw on the government brief that in an earlier and not in an earlier proceeding not related directly to this, at least not in this record, there was some motion evidently made to transfer the proceedings to Hawaii and this was resisted by the alien who desired the proceedings to be held in Los Angeles, I presume, where he was and where his counsel was.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.545" offset="2386129">However, from that, I would make the comment that the alien basically asked that he be present to confront, to consult with his counsel and to participate in cross-examination at his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.840" offset="2491350">Where that hearing might be, although, he might also have positions respecting that, was not as crucial as that the fact that he should, at least, be present wherever it be.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.249" offset="2540983">As a matter of fact, he did at some stages in his -- in the record urge that -- that he'd be taken to Hawaii.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.318" offset="2593228">Well, I was just going to ask if you conceded that -- that he could have had his hearing -- his entire hearing in Hawaii.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.039" offset="2700121">However, the -- I would say 90% of my reasoning would be met by a hearing and which the alien was present with counsel whether it had been in Hawaii or Los Angeles that the real nub of the vice was that he was in jail while his hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.975" offset="2947866">But passing that, if he were present in Hawaii, I feel that a hearing in Hawaii would then have rendered him due process of law.</text>
