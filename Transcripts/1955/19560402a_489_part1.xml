            <label>Mr. Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="27.238" offset="108878">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.647" offset="118491">This case comes to this Court by way of certiorari to review a final decision of the Supreme Court of Florida denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.519" offset="166034">The petition was filed and denied without a hearing and without requiring any response thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.460" offset="205740">The petition claimed a denial of federal rights and it claimed that the petitioner was imprisoned and had been convicted in violation of rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.586" offset="266344">Two basic grounds were asserted in support of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.405" offset="285571">One of those was a claim that petitioner had been punished three times for a single offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.203" offset="312738">And, moreover, that he'd been twice so punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.308" offset="329143">In short, that he had been punished six times for two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.664" offset="350563">The other ground, in support of that claim, was a contention that petitioner had been convicted solely and exclusively on the basis of perjured testimony of two codefendants, former employees of his who had been tried together with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.953" offset="431752">Petitioner did not make any allegation with this use of perjured testimony was known to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.164" offset="460591">No such allegation appears in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.918" offset="471667">His contention was simply that where he could make a showing such as he did in this case, a prima facie showing as strong as he could in this case, that the obligation was imposed upon the State under the Due Process Clause to afford him some remedy to rectify such a grievous wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="140.174" stopTime="148.713">
            <label>Justice Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="140.174" offset="560692">Now, absent -- absent a allegation that the State knew that he was using perjured testimony what federal question do you ask?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="148.713" offset="594756">Your Honor, the -- the petitioner, of course, realizes that the Due Process Clause applies only to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.886" offset="623491">But it's petitioner's contention that the continued imprisonment of petitioner after such a strong prima facie showing as was made in this case constitutes state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.075" offset="664242">The State is keeping this man in prison, is depriving him of his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.709" offset="678766">And it continues to do so after he has shown that two -- the two witnesses who supplied the only, the exclusive evidence in support of his conviction within six months after the trial admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.840" offset="727353">One under oath and the other one admitted it to a fellow prisoner that they had framed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.385" offset="741460">That they had deliberately decided before they went into their illegal enterprise that if they were caught, that they would implicate falsely their employer because he had a good reputation in the community, he'd never been in trouble before and they thought that so doing, they would take the owners of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.246" offset="820976">As it so happens, both of them did receive lighter sentences than the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.223" offset="844800">And it is our contention that due process requires that a State afford some remedy in that situation where a man who makes as strong a prima facie showing as this man did where he shows that the exclusive, the only evidence used to convict him was perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.228" offset="908852">There was no other evidence according to the allegations in the petition for writ of habeas corpus in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.296" offset="1009162">Your Honor, we don't necessarily contend that a new trial would have to be gone in two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.216" offset="1024836">We -- we submit that the State should afford some remedy, some -- even if that the -- the State required him to show beyond a reasonable doubt the same burden that was imposed on the State to convict him in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.070" offset="1076245">That his conviction was based solely and exclusively on perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.997" offset="1095889">Then we submit that if -- if he could make such a showing beyond unreasonable doubt, well then the State should -- should grant a new trial or should discharge him.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.575" offset="1122220">Well -- well, of course, at the trial, he had the same opportunity to show that he's perjured than he would now.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.383" offset="1157433">Except this fact, and that is that within six months after the conviction, these two codefendants came in and admitted that they had framed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.682" offset="1186691">One of them said, “May I stand before my God and say that Dan Durley is innocent of the charges that I --that I made with against him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.533" offset="1222113">And the -- the man, as according to the allegations of the petition here, the crime charge was stealing cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.025" offset="1256072">And his two codefendants took the stand and admitted according to the allegations of the petition that they were guilty of that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.602" offset="1294315">The petitioner in this case denied his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.825" offset="1307272">And the only evidence against him was the testimony of these two defendants that he was there and that he was a party to the crime or that he -- that he was a -- a member of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.646" offset="1346560">That he had conspired in any -- any event to -- with them to perform this offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.344" offset="1373309">It seems to me what you're really arguing is that if you have a little perjured testimony in the state prosecution then you can't that you don't raise a federal question as the State knew about but if you have a lot of it and you do raise a federal question even though the State didn't know about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.260" offset="1432973">Your Honor, I would certainly concede that if these were a case where there was other evidence, where say, he was captured at -- at the scene, at the (Inaudible) precisely that then perhaps the mere recantation of testimony by one of the witnesses would not be -- would not raise a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.948" offset="1511758">But where, as the allegation is here, the sole and exclusive testimony that is used to convict is perjured testimony and his admitted perjured testimony where the perjurers come in and can -- and confess their perjury that there should be, under due process of law, some remedy for a man in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.970" offset="2147788">Actually, I believe it was two steers, and two cows and one heifer, all belonging to one owner on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.578" offset="2182269">The charge, however, was contained in one information and it contained three counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.636" offset="2298462">And petitioner has -- has shown and cited in his case, in his brief, a Florida case clearly stating that under such circumstances, there is only one offense committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.878" offset="2339422">The same as whether you steal $10 or $20, whether you steal five cows or one cow, it's just one offense if you do it at one time, at the same place under the same circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2666.416" offset="10665587">As to the second question, the waiver question, and the petitioner just briefly make -- make the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.484" offset="10693904">The Florida court has held, that first of all, this Court has certainly committed the doctrine and so is the Florida Supreme Court that it will not be quick to rule that a man waives his fundamental constitutional rights and that courts will indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of such fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.365" offset="10773420">And certainly, that rule is most appropriate to apply in this case, where the man drew up his own petition at one time and in the other case where he -- where he drew -- where his lawyer drew up a one-shot, very technical one, attacking the face of the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.723" offset="10838831">And certainly, the whole that is failure to -- to raise this double punishment point and his perjured testimony being the exclusive evidence against him would be the most -- argue his result to -- to say that by -- by failing to include all of those in one petition, he'd waived, he'd consented to being imprisoned in violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.819" offset="10943216">I had submitted that if the Florida Supreme Court had so held that it would have stated so, rather than simply stating that there is no -- that he'd failed to show probable cause that he was imprisoned and that unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.913" offset="10995566">In that connection, I'd like to call attention to one of the cases cited by our respondent Washington v.Mayo where -- where the Court did refer to the fact that petitioner had made a prior petition and had not and it either probably represented this point had it determined or had not chosen to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.629" offset="11078426">And the Court, in that case, in Washington v.Mayo, nevertheless, went on and fully considered the merits of -- of petitioner's contentions and ruled against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.697" offset="11118759">In short, in that case, even though there was a pleading made of res judicata and even though the Court discussed the fact that there'd been a prior petition and that the matter might well have been determined in that prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.046" offset="11172153">Nevertheless, the Court, the Florida Supreme Court went on and considered the merits of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.813" offset="11195246">And we cite a case, a recent case by the Florida Supreme Court, adopting the very reasonable rule that res judicata is not an absolute doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.150" offset="11256581">It's not one which the Court is bound to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.955" offset="11271732">And that the Court is more interested in reaching a reasonable and a right result than applying a fiction of the law that was -- is designed merely to terminate litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.203" offset="11312797">So that even if, even conceding, way down the line, that the petitioner was barred by res judicata, the Florida Supreme Court was certainly not bound to -- to deny him on that ground and certainly in this case, we submit, on the face of its order, did not rely on that ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.562" offset="11598158">It can't be used for any legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.328" offset="11617280">Certainly, the decisions of this Court, particularly going back to the Ex parte Lange decision, as stated eloquently and simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.103" offset="11672346">That this Court will not permit the same sovereignty to punish a man twice or three times for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.840" offset="11699304">To do so offends all sense of fairness and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.434" offset="11713724">The State certainly has the right to exact it pound to flesh or to take its tooth for a tooth, or an eye for an eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.772" offset="11743086">But to do it twice and three times out in (Inaudible) is a matter that is so shocking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.655" offset="11766596">And it certainly must be held to be in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.214" offset="11788852">And particularly in this case, where that error is compounded by the fact that the man's conviction was obtained on the admitted facts in this case, solely and exclusively by the perjured testimony of two of his former employees, who'd decided that because of his good reputation, because he was their former employer, that if they put the onus on him, that they would relieve themselves of full blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.130" offset="11896477">Certainly, where you have that combination of circumstances, right and justice cry out that a man not be subjected to more than what the State itself has prescribed to be the maximum penalty for that crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.592" offset="11998354">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.564" offset="12002220">I submit that this Court has no jurisdiction to review this case because it is well-settled doctrine that where the State decision might have been based upon non-federal grounds, this Court has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.982" offset="12067840">And I say that in this case there were two probable, not just possible, but probable state grounds in which to sustain the state court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.763" offset="12114965">Now, one of those grounds is state res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.416" offset="12125623">I realized that the federal courts don't have any such rule but that does not say that the State can't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.455" offset="12157806">No attack is made in the brief of petitioner upon the State's rule of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.951" offset="12183719">It's been the law of Florida for many years in section 79.10 of the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.438" offset="12205662">He's got it and it's appended to his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.211" offset="12216842">And it has been interpreted by our court to mean what it says, without a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.618" offset="12242442">Then, if there were no res judicata involved, we would still have an alternative state ground which is perfectly valid and adequate and that is to say our court has flat-footedly ruled as where a person has had a fair and reasonable opportunity to present the claims which he now makes, and has not done so, he will not be heard to present them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.762" offset="12354978">Now, in 1952, Mr. Durley had counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.471" offset="12385802">He went into the Circuit Court of Union County, Florida, and filed a petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.419" offset="12413597">As far as we know, after full consultation with Mr. Durley, both of them filed a petition, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.196" offset="12436689">It's made -- it's a -- it's a prior assumption that they had gone over his case before that petition was prepared and signed and filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.848" offset="12475350">That petition contrary to Mr. Rutledge's contention, as I construe it, is not bottomed upon the face of the record alone, but as I construe that petition, it says that the first count, there were two separate information, before them had three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.471" offset="12521848">It says that -- that the -- that the second count of the first information alleged the same crime as was charged in the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.976" offset="12575869">That the third count alleged the same crime as was charged in the second count and in the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.082" offset="12600320">Then it took the other information and dealt with it, likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.716" offset="12614844">And in that petition, it said that he was being -- he had served enough time whether you gain time to make it 10 years, that -- that two separate sentences of five years each with a maximum that it could have lawfully been imposed on it because he said he was -- he had actually committed only one crime in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.448" offset="12709721">And therefore, 10 years is the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.210" offset="12716826">He said, "I have served that, must have been or got better, gained time."</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.755" offset="12730932">He alleged also that his right for his -- he was united -- he was being detained contrary to his United States constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.415" offset="12765623">He didn't mention the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.107" offset="12772415">He didn't mention due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.679" offset="12778684">He didn't mention equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.213" offset="12788820">He didn't mention anything else except contrary to the -- to the provisions of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.111" offset="12816405">A writ was issued upon the basis of that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.805" offset="12827167">The respondent who had the same response as you see here before this Court filed a -- a return in which he admitted certain things, denied others, and among the things he'd admitted was that he had served enough time to make 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.723" offset="12894877">It was a gain in time to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.822" offset="12903236">So, the question was gradually before the Circuit Court, has he -- is he being held to serve multiple sentences contrary to the United States Constitution or has he not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.508" offset="12957989">The Circuit Court, after issuing that writ, heard the argument and quashed the writ and remanded the petitioner to custody, the appeal of the Supreme Court of Florida which dismissed his appeal upon the respondent's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.863" offset="13011383">Now, I submit that in that case, he raised exactly the same question that he now raises before this Court as to multiple punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.551" offset="13274175">I believe that their statement to the effect of the decision of this Court as to what it takes and -- and to respect particularity and definiteness in raising a federal question in a -- in a state court is in a state of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.128" offset="13336451">While the reading I've done on the question, conventions mean that they're absolutely correct on that and that this Court has -- has enough separate doctrines and -- and inconsistent and as the law now stands, it is a trifle uncertain as to how you must go about raising up the federal question below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.964" offset="13419833">I know that there are some of the old decisions said you had to just put your finger right squarely if you're on this ground with the Due Process Clause in Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.526" offset="13458077">You had to say, Due Process Clause, Fourteenth Amendment, United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.903" offset="13483572">I know, though, that in (Inaudible) it was decided many years ago, this Court, in effect, recognized that in all instances that wasn't the exactly the law and that it could be done without being quite so specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.903" offset="13547520">I know that in the recent decisions of this Court, there are notable examples of where they'd practically raised no federal question at all so far as -- as in -- in compliance with the old (Inaudible) is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.648" offset="13602586">You take the Braniff Airways case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.381" offset="13609482">They came up here on a -- on a Commerce Clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.526" offset="13626096">They never thought about Fourteenth Amendment was parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.439" offset="13637695">They never mentioned Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.568" offset="13646263">They relied on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.770" offset="13655040">But when he got up here, this Court says and that's where it -- and this is where the Court cited in the (Inaudible) and support of this is its holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.490" offset="13685864">This Court says they raised the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.452" offset="13693806">(Inaudible) says they raised the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.204" offset="13700807">They set up their facts showing that the tax situs were not in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.699" offset="13718779">They say -- said it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.631" offset="13726511">That, we are not going to be too tight about whether they said Fourteenth Amendment or a due process, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.122" offset="13760470">They have substantially raised the due process question and I think this Court proceeded to decide the question on the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.685" offset="13798713">In the Gibbs-Burke case, that is equally far from the -- some of the earlier cases decided by this Court in Gibbs against Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.314" offset="13841241">He came up here and I haven't read the record but I have only this Court's opinion to go by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.859" offset="13859422">And it -- it quotes him as having relied on the original ten amendments from Article 6 of what -- of the pharmaceutical guide of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.836" offset="13923265">Nobody from this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.520" offset="13934028">It's just that indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.334" offset="13945313">Nevertheless, this Court just cast aside all of its failure to mention the Fourteenth Amendment or due process of the Constitution of the United States and said that meticulous insistence upon regularity in procedural allegations is foreign to the purpose of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.697" offset="14038727">And so, the Court took that petition and decided it on the Due -- Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.654" offset="14062550">On the Fourteenth Amendment it says, if it's in Court, all in good shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.509" offset="14078015">So, in the light of the Brennan's case and Gibbs against Burke, I say that when he filed this 1952 petition in which he distinctly claimed that he has committed only two crimes, one of each information, that each of the three types is only the information charged the same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.927" offset="14151680">And that each of them and the other one charged the same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.780" offset="14163069">And he wound up, he was more particular than some of these other cases have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.305" offset="14181146">He did say that he's been held contrary to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.821" offset="14199223">And I see it in the light of the Gibbs case and the Brennan's case, he made a wonderful showing that he -- his federal constitutional due process rights have been violated so far as to put this thing on the United States Constitution is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.829" offset="14255229">I recognize that in Gibbs against Burke, he was not represented by counsel and that in -- in Durley, this 1952 petition, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.863" offset="14295353">But if the Brennan's people were represented by counsel when they were allowed on the Due Process Clause and you -- and --and the Court decided the case on the -- on the -- I mean they relied on the Commerce Clause and this Court decided the case on the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.666" offset="14358570">And I say that in the light of this Court's pronouncing in Gibbs that about the meticulous regularity or procedural allegations thing foreign to habeas corpus in view of that pronouncement, I'd say that in spite the fact that Durley was represented by counsel in 1952, that he said adequately raised the same federal constitutional question which is now before this Court with regard to multiplicity of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.759" offset="14567027">I want to mention that res judicata just a little bit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.212" offset="14576744">Mr. Rutledge doesn't construe the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida just like I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.459" offset="14601822">I got the impression from his argument that he feels that nothing is res judicata in habeas corpus in Florida unless there has been a writ issued and testimony taken and then a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.621" offset="14658456">That isn't the law of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.523" offset="14666083">I know there are some cases where that's occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.056" offset="14676219">You take State ex rel.Davis against (Inaudible) and the State ex rel.-- somebody -- against Prescott and some other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.867" offset="14707461">In fact, the argument, I can find you several where that actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.312" offset="14725224">The issue to the writ took testimony and then decided against him and then the -- they -- they tried to forget about that and run up to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.601" offset="14762318">That was in the -- in the Circuit Court and ran up to the Supreme Court and said, "Give me a writ on this -- on the same factual allegations" and the Supreme Court said, "Oh, no."</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.109" offset="14796382">It says, "You -- you have had your day on these facts there down at low end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.525" offset="14822087">The Supreme Court did point out the issues of the writ they'd taken in testimony."</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.060" offset="14836193">But that isn't essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.882" offset="14843507">If you read Moat against Mayo, in 82 So.2d, you'll find that the rule goes just this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.431" offset="14873704">That if a former petitioner has raised the same question that is now raised by the current petition and that petition has been denied even without the issuance of a writ, no testimony, no writ, no nothing except denied the petition, that is a bar of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.244" offset="14960953">They cited Section 79.10, if I'm not barely mistaken, in Moat against Mayo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.531" offset="14986031">That's the most recent pronouncement of our Court on that particular face of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.705" offset="15010795">But it wouldn't make any difference to the decision of this Court whether there was any res judicata in the mind of the Supreme Court of Florida or not because of the corollary rule that if he has had a fair and adequate opportunity to present the matter which he now presents, the issues to the question, he will not be heard now, even if he didn't present before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.711" offset="15118838">In State ex rel.Johnson against Mayo, I think it's in 69 So.2d -- it maybe 66-- the Supreme Court of Florida later said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.800" offset="15167112">He said that the petitioner, it recounted the various proceedings the way it had been in Court before and then said that petitioner makes no attempt to give any reason why he did not raise in the trial proceeding the question which he raises here or the question which he raises here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.872" offset="15251435">Under the decisions, therefore, he has waived the questions that he now seeks to present.</text>

            <text syncTime="4116.274" offset="16465084">I -- I tell the Court, if it be true, I said now, he raises the same question in a -- in a petition he filed here last year or from two years ago, whenever it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.648" offset="16522553">And if it be true, I say, he had a fair and adequate opportunity to have raised those questions in the former petition or petitions, sometimes, we have a lot of them to come in through the years from the same man, tell the Court what those -- I point those two things out to them and they enter the -- perhaps for many years entered the same order that they entered in this case here of denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.720" offset="16630805">That is to say the substance of it is that he -- that we've -- that the petitioner has failed to show probable cause to believe that he is being unlawfully detained.</text>
