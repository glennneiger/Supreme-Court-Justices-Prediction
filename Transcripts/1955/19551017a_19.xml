            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="39706">Mr. Fitzpatrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.969" offset="131866">You may proceed, Mr. Fitzpatrick.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard H. Fitzpatrick</label>
            <text syncTime="34.915" offset="139598">If the Court please, this case is here on petition of -- for certiorari for the examination of two questions decided in the first instance by the National Labor Relations Board and affirmed on appeal by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.667" offset="210651">The two questions will designate, first, the loss of status question that arises under Section 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, which we'll advert to at more length in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.345" offset="277316">The second question which was allowed on the petition for the writ was the contract question, that is, whether the Board properly found that the strike involved in this issue -- in this proceeding was not a violation of a no-strike commitment made in a contract by one of the unions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.649" offset="394553">Now, I'm going to make a rather brief truncated statement of the facts because that is all that's required to raise the strict issues of law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.589" offset="442305">However, I may, later on in the argument, advert to certain facts which I do not state at this time not because I think that there are necessary to raise the issues, but because they may throw some light on the reasons why Congress undertook to an Act as brought an Act as it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.438" offset="529659">The petitioner, to get on with the facts, operates a plant in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.965" offset="563827">In 1949, it entered into a collective bargaining contract with a union, Local 22045, a federal union of the American Federation of Labor which, then, was unquestionably the representative of the employees concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.919" offset="659644">That contract contained a no-strike clause, the language of which we will get to in its appropriate place.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.214" offset="708754">The contract was about half expired when, in August of 1950, a CIO union, Local 65 of the Merchandise Workers, I believe it is, made an organizational attack on the plant and it met with a good deal of success, at least sufficient to enable it to file a petition for recognition for the National Labor Relations Board in the latter part of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.051" offset="856189">Meanwhile, the incumbent union, Local 22045, had demanded on about September 7th, some weeks before its 60-day renewal period of its contract approached, an increase of wages in the amount of 12-and-a half cents per hour, and that was all.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.242" offset="964963">The petitioner here was admittedly concerned with the reputation of the assaulting union, Local 65, as being inflicted or infiltrated with Communism, which he opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.386" offset="1037479">He proposed, therefore, to the incumbent union that they join together to take steps to combat the rating union, Local 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.246" offset="1092963">They believed, however, that the incumbent was a bit too weak to cope with the situation and, so, he got in touch with another union, a Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.267" offset="1157016">And, he sought to induce the incumbent, Local 22045, to turn over the bargaining agency to this Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.273" offset="1233084">That attempt to induce a voluntary turnover of the agency failed and it is found, and we do not now deny before this Court, that the petitioner, thereupon, committed a series of unfair labor practices which may be summed up as supporting an organizational drive in support of Local 318 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.305" offset="1369130">There was one additional unfair labor practice to which I'll advert in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.693" offset="1394730">In October of 1950, we have this situation then that the representation proceeding was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.393" offset="1441541">The employer supported, and which Board -- the Board properly held to be an unfair labor practice, an organizational drive to unseat the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.284" offset="1501100">And, the bargaining agent itself reacted by upping its demands to 25 cents per hour and including a demand for a welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.601" offset="1542374">At some later point, in the dealings between then and the time of the strike which I'm about to come to, Local 22045 concluded that it itself wished to transfer its bargaining rights to the Carpenters Union, a Local 3127.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.288" offset="1633071">The reason why it said it wanted to do that was because the bargaining -- because the Carpenters Union was equipped to administer the welfare fund which it had demanded, and it itself was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.772" offset="1707050">We come down to November 10th, then, with the situation of three, at least, contending interests on the union's side, Local 65, Local 318, and this hybrid Local 22045-3127.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.068" offset="1792209">On November 10th, there was an employee by the name of Ciccone, employed in the machine shop, and he had, unquestionably, been soliciting on behalf of the 22045-3127 combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.103" offset="2300343">The Board -- the Board draws a conclusion or, rather, counsel for the Board draws a conclusion which is, I think, supported by the Board's own opinion of the case, and his conclusion is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.786" offset="2351125">That you cannot assert, as a defense, your no-strike clause for the reason that the strike was caused by unfair labor practices and you cannot take advantage of your own wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.975" offset="2407863">Now, we would say that if “course” were used in the absolute scientific sense by the Board, that that would be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.286" offset="2445061">However, intervening between the unfair labor practice, which is the stated cause, and the result which is the strike, you have the voluntary action of the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.408" offset="2509531">They don't have to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.909" offset="2515592">Nobody forced them to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.978" offset="2559896">I would say that, in this precise connection, if there were such a connection between the asserted cause and the asserted result that one inevitably flowed from the other, the connection would be scientific, but they are voluntary intervening acts of parties not under the control of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.947" offset="2671700">And, I say that when the Board says the strike was caused by the unfair labor practices, we will admit that but only in the sense that the strike action was taken voluntarily in response to the unfair labor practices which were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.042" offset="2756127">On November 10th, then, Ciccone is employed in the machine shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.002" offset="2783922">He is distributing literature or soliciting signatures on behalf of the -- let's call it the incumbent Carpenters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.622" offset="2830420">I think for all practical purposes, we may assume that the incumbent and the Carpenters Union were one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.726" offset="2858841">They had the same officers, same offices, and one appeared to be the alter ego of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.798" offset="2887158">They have been so treated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.330" offset="2909309">The president of the petitioner tells him to stop his duties which were of a roving character and confine his activities to the machine shop for the balance of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.082" offset="2976287">The president's -- the president of the petitioner was going downtown to a Board of Directors meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.817" offset="3023203">At about -- that was about noon time.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.809" offset="3039190">At somewhere around the hour of 3 o'clock that afternoon, it was reported to the president who had called into the plant over the telephone that Ciccone was out of his department, he ordered Ciccone fired, the rest of the machine shop stopped within 10 minutes after the firing of Ciccone.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.886" offset="3147442">Some other departments stropped within, let's say, a half-hour after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.251" offset="3168967">The balance of the plant continued working that day, including the night shift which came on later but, the following morning, there was a picket line -- I should say, a picket line was established outside that afternoon rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.127" offset="3228421">And, the following morning, there picket line continued under the auspices of the Carpenters Union, Local 3127 and the plant, for all practical purposes, was down and on a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.553" offset="3286204">That was November 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.037" offset="3304072">The plant did not resume operation until December 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.387" offset="3329463">And, at that time, all who did not return to work, some-70 odd in number who are the dischargees which are the subject of this order, were discharged by the company and they have never been reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.877" offset="3407412">Now, they are the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.450" offset="3425698">There were two defenses asserted by petitioner below.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.564" offset="3450253">And, the first of these was that the employees involved strikers, which are the subject and the reinstatement order, had lost their status under Section 8 (d) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.328" offset="3517231">One of the phrases in -- in Section 8 (d) is “any employee who strikes” -- I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.518" offset="3610018">Oh yes, they made a bid for reinstatement but not until March of the succeeding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.831" offset="3651291">And, there is no question that none of them -- that any of them has ever been reemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.354" offset="3685355">The specific portion of the Act involved -- reads, “any employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Section 8, 9, and 10 of this Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.290" offset="3785143">But, such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="953.987" offset="3815863">Now, it is not enough for me merely to read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.711" offset="3830805">I will summarize what goes before.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.160" offset="3844598">That appears in a Section, 8 (d), which is basically designed to define what collective bargaining is, and it gives, in the forepart of the section, a generic definition of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.702" offset="3934772">And, in the latter part of the section under a proviso clause, it gives a definition of what collective bargaining consists of where there is in existence a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.751" offset="3998929">Roughly, that runs, provided that where there is, in effect, a collective bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification takes several steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.339" offset="4101329">Among which, are notifies the other party to the contract that it desires the termination 60-days prior to the termination desired, notifies the mediation service 30 days thereafter of the continued existence of a labor dispute, offers to meet and confer with the other party on the terms of the renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.018" offset="4216059">And, finally, continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lockout, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of 60 days after such notice as -- is given or until the expiration of such contract, whichever occurs later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.903" offset="4307592">Now, then, with some intervening matter of no immediate consequence, we find the loss-of-status clause, which goes on as I read before, “any employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period, and specified in this subsection, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Section 8, 9, and 10 of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.439" offset="4437682">Now, that defense was asserted below, that is, we said these employees struck within that 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.226" offset="4488882">A notice of termination had been served on October 10th, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.784" offset="4527125">That would have made a 60-day period extending from October 10th to December 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.339" offset="4557322">The strike here occurred on the 10th of November and continued thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.269" offset="4588983">We said, therefore, these employees have lost status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.387" offset="4609463">The Board has no jurisdiction to enter the order which it has entered here because none of the subjects of that order are employees within the meaning of the Act, having lost that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.064" offset="4676232">Now, the treatment of our objection and defense by the Board was this, and I must admit that I can't quite say what the scope of the decisions below is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.500" offset="5529913">Let me pick up now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.594" offset="5546318">The treatment of these objections below, I said I was a little bit uncertain as to just how far the Board and/or the court below wanted to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.724" offset="5610893">They say that the loss-of-status clause is a part of the section as a whole and, of course, no one can gain to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.148" offset="5668571">And, they say the section as a whole is devoted to the problem of termination or modification of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.862" offset="5707442">It specifies the method whereby collective contracts ought to be terminated and modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.201" offset="5744744">Therefore, the loss-of-status clause, although its language, nobody disputes that its literal language supports the construction of petitioner here, although its language is broad, its intent must be narrowed by the obligations laid upon the parties in the foregoing part of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.793" offset="5867102">Therefore, when we have a strike question before us, under the loss-of-status clause, the question becomes, is it a strike to terminate or modify a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.900" offset="5931572">Now, I've said that I was a little dubious as to whether that was only the holding below or whether the holding was to be narrowed a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.006" offset="5983922">The language used is susceptible of the interpretation that only unfair labor practice strikes are excluded by the Board in -- under its rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.592" offset="6058318">I think the Board, perhaps, was a little bit more clear on that, and I would be inclined to say that what the Board held was that only a strike designed to terminate or modify a contract would be held to be a strike within the purview of the loss-of-status clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.369" offset="6133447">Now, that leaves a number of strikes which are completely in the neutral ground, for instance, a strike to procure recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.487" offset="6173884">Let's say that there is an incumbent bargaining agent that a foreign union, such as Local 65 in this case, came in but, instead of adopting the feasible procedures of the Board, suppose it said to the employer, “We want you to recognize us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.543" offset="6246087">And, the employer said, “No, I won't recognize you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.734" offset="6258834">Look, I've got an incumbent union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.562" offset="6266149">And, Local 65 said, “We'll strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.307" offset="6277224">Well, it might well be that they would be in a position to make that strike effective whether or not they represented the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.881" offset="6311497">Under the Board rule, as I read it to my best judgment, the Board would say that such a strike, again, is not within the ambit of the loss-of-status clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.202" offset="6372728">In other words, the striking employees in that case would work no forfeiture of there remedies upon themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.879" offset="6411494">The Second Circuit, I think, was a little bit more cloudy in its construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.483" offset="6441900">I don't think it knew quite whether it wanted to hold the position that I've just described or whether it merely wanted to see that unfair labor practice strikers were not denied the remedies prescribed for them in the Act by virtue of the loss-of-status clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.273" offset="6533016">The situation there was that, between the time we had got the Board decision and the time the Circuit Court of Appeals heard our argument in the -- on this case, the Eighth Circuit had decided Local 3, United Packing House Workers against NLRB, that was the Wilson &amp; Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.629" offset="6638446">And, the Board had predicated much of its opinion in our case on the Wilson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.829" offset="6683272">But, by the time we got in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Eighth Circuit had reversed the Board on the Wilson doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.965" offset="6719843">And, that left the Second Circuit rather hanging in midair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.859" offset="6739383">And, so, it finally came to the conclusion that perhaps there is a distinction between the Local 3 case and this one lying in the fact that, here, we have unfair labor practices antecedent to the strike, and in the Local 3 case there were no such antecedent unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.041" offset="6840111">Now, let me argue the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.189" offset="6888699">I've already adverted to the observation that there is really no fact question underlying the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.478" offset="6921822">Everybody concedes that the strike occurred within the prohibited time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.852" offset="6947318">Everybody concede that none of these employees has been reemployed so as to restore his rights, nor is there any question that, if the words of the loss-of-status clause be given their literal meaning, the defense should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.451" offset="7025789">The question relates solely to whether is -- whether the literal meaning is the meaning to be adopted or whether that meaning is to be modified by something else in the section or in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.055" offset="7092140">Now, let me call the Court's attention to the language of Congress that we are going to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.194" offset="7124741">Any employees starts off with, “any” is a term of universality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.016" offset="7160059">It is put there to broaden deliberately the ambit of employees to whom this is to apply, “any employee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.294" offset="7225156">Now, you'll notice later in the wording, any employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period, and so forth, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.323" offset="7313241">Now, those words, particularly “of the employer engaged in this particular dispute,” are an aversion by Congress to the basic definition of employer which is contained in two-three of the Act, in which it says the term “employee” shall include any employee and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer unless the Act explicitly states otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.698" offset="7442704">Here, the section is explicitly stating otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.071" offset="7472274">And, you will notice that two-three goes on further to include any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of or in connection with or because of any unfair labor practice, and we seek to draw from that, from the particular aversion to that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.399" offset="7573525">This, that the Congress, when it rejected a particular implication of that definition, accepted what remained and what remained was a definition which included an employee whose work had ceased in connection with or as -- as a result of an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.473" offset="7669864">Now, let's go further into the language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.257" offset="7696927">Any employee who engages in a strike, take the word, "strike."</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.736" offset="7726916">That is a word which has a statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.906" offset="7743530">Section 501 of the Labor Management Relations Act which amended the Wagner Act contains a specific definition of “strike” which, again, contains the broad term, "any strike."</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.718" offset="7814792">Now, not only does it refer to any strike, but that section gives internal evidence of having been drawn precisely with the contract renewal problem in mind for one of the inclusions in that definition is, specifically, the no contract-no work strike which Mr. John L. Lewis made famous several years before the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.973" offset="7943837">That's further made clear by Section 502 which follows it, which excludes safety strikes as rather narrowly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.130" offset="7992424">They define a safety strike as a strike occurring by reason of the immediate presence of danger at the status of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.028" offset="8040072">So that, we know that Congress, when it was dealing with this problem, had fully in mind the problem of whether they wanted to exclude strikes on a qualitative basis or on a temporal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.668" offset="8110602">Let's return again to the provisions of the specific loss-of-status clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.433" offset="8157727">Any employee who engages in a strike within the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.757" offset="8183014">Now, that is clearly a temporal standard of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.802" offset="8207151">There is nothing qualitative about it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.324" offset="8221257">It's measured exclusively as a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.411" offset="8241633">Now, did Congress mean that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.688" offset="8254694">We have some evidence that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.371" offset="8273398">The language of the loss-of-status clause came out of the Senate version of the bill, S.1126.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.072" offset="8316238">As it originally appeared in that bill, the loss-of-status clause didn't say within the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.637" offset="8370469">It said prior to the expiration of the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.387" offset="8397531">That version of the bill obtained through the initial report and through its inclusion by the Senate in the bill which went to Conference, and it was changed only by the Conference Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.204" offset="8476735">Now, we have further evidence along the same line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.984" offset="8503902">Every reference to this in the commissioner -- in the committee reports, and there are only two of them, I have collated them in an appendix to the reply brief, refers exclusively to a temporal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.368" offset="8573388">There is no suggestion anywhere that a qualitative measure of conduct was intended by Congress, all quantitative temporal, within the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.603" offset="8642351">Now, at this point, you'd have to assume, if you wanted to follow the Board construction, that Congress made at least three independent language errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.477" offset="8693864">Now, the assumption that Congress made three independent language errors in a very short sentence is rather farfetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.211" offset="8744751">And, I think if we will examine this section further, we'll see that Congress was not erring at all, but Congress was dealing with a separate facet of the renegotiation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.708" offset="8798772">Let's go on with the wording, any employee who engages on a strike within the 60-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of Sections 8, 9, and 10 of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.672" offset="8898664">Now, Your Honors will notice that there is no condemnation of the conduct of the person who strikes within this 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.086" offset="8948297">This loss-of-status clause does not say that a strike within the 60-day period is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.451" offset="8985704">It doesn't attempt to characterize the conduct to say that, just because you strike within the 60-day period, you are committing a misdemeanor or some sort rather or you are -- you are committing conduct which should be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.315" offset="9057176">It doesn't say anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.929" offset="9071700">It deals solely with the status of the employee under the remedial sections of the Act, those are Sections 8, 9, and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.667" offset="9122586">It says, nothing whatever about his status under Section 7 of the Act, which is the substantive section giving him the right to organize and bargain collectively and to engage in other concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.913" offset="9183608">It leaves that section -- his rights under that Section complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.308" offset="9205133">Of course, a certain number of men, to a certain degree -- to a certain extent and to a certain degree, they are unenforceable because the remedial Sections 8, 9, and 10 are being denied to him by this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.480" offset="9265842">Now, what is the significance of that selective language?</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.194" offset="9292696">Let's take Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.818" offset="9307220">He's barred from his rights under Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.169" offset="9320594">That means that he can't be a protagonist in a representation proceeding brought before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.308" offset="9357166">He can't be a voter in its elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.019" offset="9372003">He can't be a respond -- a party respondent to a proceeding bought -- brought by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.757" offset="9410978">He's completely divorced from a representation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.126" offset="9432503">It's the literal language of this before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.975" offset="9443892">Now, why should that be so?</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.326" offset="9453296">Unless Congress had contemplated that organizational difficulties, representation questions, might be pending at or about the time of contract renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.575" offset="9530201">Congress knew that very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.727" offset="9546815">Congress, in enacting this situation or enacting this whole section allowing 60 days for renegotiation, was quite cognizant of the contract bar doctrine of the Board which permitted questions from being -- representation questions from being raised until pretty near the 60th day prior to the expiration of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.724" offset="9646811">It knew that representation proceedings would be pending during, rather, in a certain number of the cases which would fall under this section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.303" offset="9709192">Therefore, we may infer that Congress had in mind denying a striker who went out on a recognition strike, a status in the type of proceeding which a recognition -- which a representation proceeding would be designed to circumvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.199" offset="9808771">All right, that's Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.632" offset="9818488">Now, they bar him also from Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.655" offset="9834580">Section 8 is the section which defines what an unfair labor practice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.526" offset="9874077">Under the old Wagner Act, it was unilateral in finding the employer only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.361" offset="9893407">Today, it's bilateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.921" offset="9919634">Why does the Congress bar an employee from access to Section 8?</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.955" offset="9963729">Unless it presupposes that he has been the victim of an unfair labor practice or that he will be the victim of an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.614" offset="10018377">The very relief that it denies to it is the relief that he would need when, and only when, he had been ousted from his job, demoted, or been the victim of some other discrimination where he would need the Board to lift him up again and reinstate him in his former place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.946" offset="10111687">Now, of course, we also have Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.562" offset="10142198">Section 10 is the procedural section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.150" offset="10172500">That's the section under which he goes to the Board, files a charge, the Board issues a complaint, has a hearing, makes a finding, issues, and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.335" offset="10229238">Now, there is no point to putting in a denial of relief under Section 10, unless the Board was aiming at the unfair labor practice at -- at knocking out the employee's -- the strikers' access for unfair labor practices which had been committed prior to the strike and which were pending undetermined before the man hit the breaks, as the saying goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.243" offset="10368940">Section 10 appears to have been put there precisely to block the contention that the loss-of-status clause does not apply to antecedent unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.685" offset="10446681">What Congress has done under this section -- Your -- Your Honors will further notice that the concluding words of the section restore the man's loss-of-status immediately upon reemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.532" offset="10510106">Now, let me equate what Congress has done here to the notion that we have in other fields of law of an election of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.604" offset="10558380">Congress hasn't said this conduct of striking is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.923" offset="10575621">It merely says “we buy your remedy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.048" offset="10596101">You have a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.590" offset="10610312">You may have a remedy by strike or you may have a remedy by the processes of the Board, but you cannot have both in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.871" offset="10671438">If you think that a strike is an efficacious remedy for your problem, you may go ahead and strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.013" offset="10708010">We don't condemn your action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.557" offset="10714175">We say not a word about it being unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.443" offset="10725669">We don't make it an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.886" offset="10735491">Nobody consents you, but you can't go to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.648" offset="10754508">You can't ride the two horses at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.049" offset="10764121">If your strike interferes with renegotiation, however, and you have -- and your strike was the wrong remedy, we will leave you precisely where we found you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.760" offset="10834965">We will not, again, put you in a position to resort to the remedy which you thought was so slow or inefficacious that you disregarded it in favor of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.996" offset="10891912">In other words, you may follow the ways of peace and, if you do, you have your full rights before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.145" offset="10924513">On the other hand, you may disrupt negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.197" offset="10944784">And, that refers not only to the incumbent bargaining union, but to the contesters, to the other unions, to political factions within the incumbent union, to anyone who, for his own designs and for his own purposes, whether or not those designs and purposes accord with those of the incumbent union, loses the remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.744" offset="13642919">The net of Mr. Fitzpatrick's argument, seems to me, is -- and when I speak of his argument, I'm also including matters attached on in the brief but not in the course of Mr. Fitzpatrick's oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.112" offset="13704359">The net of his argument, it seems to us, is that the no-strike clause in the collective bargaining contract between the parties and Section 8 (d) of the Act, in effect, licensed the employer to engage in the most serious, the most provocative type of unfair labor practices during the life of the contract or during the so-called waiting period prescribed by Section 8 (d) without risking a lawful strike on the part of the employees to protest that kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.591" offset="13850331">Now, the Board and the two court of appeals which have passed upon this issue, namely, the court below and the Seventh Circuit, have held that neither the no-strike clause nor Section 8 (d) of the Act confer such a license upon the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.190" offset="13924728">Before I come to discussing these two questions in this case, I think it is important to an understanding of this case to focus attention upon the setting in which the two questions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.532" offset="13970077">I'm not sure if they've been -- that the setting has been completely covered by Mr. Fitzpatrick's opening argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.910" offset="13999543">As Mr. Fitzpatrick said, there was a collective bargaining agreement here between the company, the petitioners, and the collective bargaining representative of the employers which, for purposes of simplicity, I shall call the “carpenters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.551" offset="14054191">That contract was about to expire sometime late in November and, because it was about to expire, it would make possible a redetermination of the employees' bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.969" offset="14107794">And, as a matter of fact, because of that possibility, Local 65 had filed a petition with the Board asking, in effect, the Board to hold an election upon the expiration of the contract to the then current contract to re-determine the employer's choice of bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.380" offset="14181460">The company was strongly opposed to Local 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.238" offset="14196924">At the same time, it felt that the incumbent union, the Carpenters, could not successfully oppose Local 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.441" offset="14229734">The company felt, however, that a third union, which I shall call the “paper workers,” could oppose successfully the organizing efforts of Local 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.003" offset="14267977">And, accordingly, the company concluded to give the Paper Workers assistance in succeeding the Carpenters as the employers bargaining representatives upon the expiration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.490" offset="14317923">To that end, the employer, as the record demonstrates, engaged in a course of conduct which was designed to coerce the employees to dissert the incumbent union, the Carpenters, and to insure the succession of the Paper Workers as their bargaining representatives upon the expiration of the existing contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.713" offset="14402769">And, to this end, the company here gave of its time, its money, and its effort assisting the Paper Workers in organizing the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.036" offset="14448118">And, indeed, the company went even beyond that because the company worked with employees with economic reprisals if they did not join the favored union and promised those -- and promised -- and also promised the employees with economic benefits if they did join the union favored by the -- by the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3728.652" offset="14914560">The -- as I was saying, a majority of employees subjected to these pressures by the employer signed application cards for membership in the Paper Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.876" offset="14979448">Upon reflection, however, though, a substantial number of these employees revoked this application membership cards and reaffirmed their allegiance to the incumbent union, the Carpenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.181" offset="15032633">Now, one of the leading opponents of the Paper Workers Union and, by Paper Workers, I mean the union favored by the employer, one of the leading opponents was an employee named Ciccone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.125" offset="15088431">On November 13th, the company climaxed its support of the Paper Workers and its opposition to the incumbent union by discharging Ciccone on a very flimsy pretext but, obviously, because he was opposed to the Paper Workers which Ciccone termed as the boss' union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.411" offset="15169620">When Ciccone was discharged, his fellow employees in Machine Shop walked out and when representatives of the company threatened other employees with similar reprisals if they failed to join in the favored union, the upshot was that all the employers walked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.429" offset="15245688">Now, the record is clear and the Board and the court below so found that although the incumbent union had given notice to modify the contract, the record is clear, nevertheless, that the strike, although triggered by Ciccone's discharge, was caused fundamentally by the employer's efforts over a period of time to destroy the employee's choice in the -- in the selection of their bargain representatives and to unseat the incumbent collective bar -- the incumbent bargaining representative upon the expiration of its contract and to substitute in its place the favored Paper Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.304" offset="15425202">Now, that brings us, I think, to the fresh old question in this case in which, unfortunately, Mr. Fitzpatrick, because of lack of time, wasn't able to touch upon but, nevertheless, I do think we have to consider it because it is a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.184" offset="15488731">If this question should be resolved against the Board, the Court would have no occasion to reach the interpretation of Section 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.897" offset="15531572">The no-strike clause in this contract is cast in a somewhat comprehensive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.028" offset="15560098">It includes -- it says, in so many words, that the union shall not engage in any strike or work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.220" offset="15584862">Nevertheless, we think that, despite the comprehensive language of the clause, it may not fairly be read in isolation.After all, the no-strike clause is part of the bargain which the employer and the union have struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.335" offset="15653303">And, because it is only part of that bargain, it must be read in the light of the entire bargain which a -- which two parties have reached and which they have incorporator in their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.291" offset="15697084">Now, obviously, the no-strike commitment which the union gives is a prize or a quid pro quo which is -- it is willing to pay in exchange for a contract covering terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.806" offset="15759151">In this particular case, the union has obtained a contract establishing the substantive terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.364" offset="15797394">And, by the no-strike clause, by the no-strike commitment, it agrees that, during the life of contract, it will not engage in a strike to compel a modification or termination of the agreed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.811" offset="15847236">Likewise, this particular contract sets up a grievance and an arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.700" offset="15882762">And, under this grievance and arbitration procedure, the disputes which arise between the parties in the course of their normal relationships under their -- under the contract and disputes which arise between the parties with the respect of the meaning or application of the -- of the contract, these disputes are to be submitted to the grievance and arbitration procedures established by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.994" offset="15991954">Now, in establishing this procedure, we think that the parties have implicitly agreed that, to the extent that these procedures are available, namely, to the extent that these procedures are available for resolving whatever disputes may arise between the parties respecting their normal relationships under the contract, to that extent, the parties have agreed by virtue of the no-lockout -- the no-lockout and no-strike clause, the parties have agreed to refrain from self-help with respect to disputes of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.836" offset="16131344">And, by the no-strike clause, the union has, in effect, given a solemn commitment that, with respect to these matters which may be properly referred to the arbitration and grievance procedures and with respect to which the contract has made -- has provided an ordinary procedure for the resolution of such disputes, to that extent, the union has agreed to forego the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.828" offset="16231236">The commitment, I believe, does not go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.765" offset="16250984">I think, perhaps, that no one had a greater insight in these matters than the late Dean Harry Shulman of Yale University.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.290" offset="16297064">As the Court undoubtedly knows, Dean Shulman served as the permanent arbitrator under the fourth contract with United Auto Workers and, in the course of his duties, he had occasion to comment on the scope in the breath of a no-strike clause, and I think it is significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.863" offset="16379402">He said, this is quoted at page 30 of our brief, “Now, the whole procedure of a grievance procedure with a terminable step of arbitration is to substitute that method of adjustment for strikes, lockouts, and similar measures of self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.455" offset="16445753">The very provision of a grievance procedure, have an umpire whose decisions are final means that there must be no-strikes on matter -- on matters within his jurisdiction or for the objective of avoiding the effects of his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.100" offset="16496327">Section 1, that refers to the no-strike clause in the fourth contract, Section 1 merely makes that meaning expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.182" offset="16528718">That, in substance, Your Honor, is our position on the no-strike clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4438.077" offset="17752294">Two, it requires that party to offer to meet with the other party for the purpose of renegotiating a successor -- a successor or modified contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="4478.302" offset="17913208">The section further provides that neither party is required to discuss or to agree to any modification of the contract terms prior to the time when the contract, by its own terms, permits a reopening.</text>

            <text syncTime="4998.546" offset="19994122">And, I think that when we do take a look at the consequences which flow from the company's reading of the statute, it becomes all the more apparent that Congress could not have intended that interpretation and that, certainly, we should not impute that interpretation to Congress in the light of these very strange consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.397" offset="20069564">The interpretation which the company imposes upon this section means that if you have a union which is satisfied with its contract, and therefore is given no notice to either terminate or modify as required by this section, and the employer in that situation commits unfair labor practices, then the union may engage in a lawful strike against the employer's unfair labor practices without the loss of employee status by the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.944" offset="20179696">On the other hand, it means that if, as in this case, the union is dissatisfied with its contract and has given notice to modify and terminate it and that the employer then proceeds to engage in unfair labor practices, that the union's hands, as the Chief Justice said, are tied except by way of filing charges with the Board -- with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.768" offset="20274991">It also means that a union which is negotiating its -- a contract for the first time is free to engage and is free to strike in protest against the employer's unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.311" offset="20333192">But, on the other hand, in the situation where a union is -- is negotiating a second contract to succeed an existing one that, in that situation, the employer enjoys the extraordinary privilege of engaging in unfair labor practices which is the union cannot protest by way -- by way of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.592" offset="20406335">I submit, Your Honor, that these consequences are so in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.383" offset="20421486">That, again, in the absence of explicit language that Congress meant to bring about such -- such results, that we should not impute a purpose to do so on the basis of the language which is now contained in Section 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.580" offset="20486269">I come, finally, to the argument which has been pressed with this bar, and that is that the specification of the loss of status under Sections 8, 9, and -- excuse me, under 8, 9, and 10 which is set forth in the concluding sentence of Section 8 (d) clearly establishes that Congress meant to reach unfair labor practice strikers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5161.175" offset="20644676">Now, there are two answers I think to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.632" offset="20666514">First of all, all that the last sentence of Section 8 (d) does is simply proscribe the sanctions which the employees will incur if they go out on strike -- they go out on the strike of the kind that Section 8 (d) contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.358" offset="20741329">In other words, Congress is saying, if you go out on the type of strike that we have set forth or described in Section 8 (d), you will lose whatever right you may have had to complain about the employer's failure to reinstate you as an unfair labor practice under Section 8, you will lose whatever voting rights you may have had under Section 9, and you will lose any -- you will lose any right to invoke the processes of the Board under Section 10 for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.044" offset="20884167">But, in order to determine, however, what kind of strike Congress had in mind and to what kind of a strike these sanctions apply, we have to look to the rest of this section, as I have indicated.And, when you look to the rest of the section, as I have said, its seems quite evident to us that what Congress had in mind was a strike in support of contract demands during this waiting periods and not strikes to protest the employer's commission of unfair labor practices, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.262" offset="20997016">Secondly, there is a simple and, what I believe to be, an adequate explanation for Congress having provided that the employees who went out on a strike of this kind would lose their status under Sections 8, 9, and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.931" offset="21059709">Under Board decisions, an employee who engages in a strike misconduct does not necessarily lose his right to read his employee status, vis a vis to a particular employer, or his right to reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.356" offset="21117388">The Board, in such situations, weigh such factors as employer provocation, the seriousness of misconduct, and other surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.752" offset="21158975">And, weighing these factors, the Board then comes to the -- determination, makes a judgment whether it would or would not effectuate the policies of the statute to require the reinstatement of this particular employee who was engaged in a certain type of strike or misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.092" offset="21220310">The legislative history indicates that Congress, in considering the 1947 amendments, was aware of the Board's practice in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.942" offset="21263673">And, Section 8 (d), it seems to us, discloses an intention to take away form the Board any power, with respect to Section 8 (d) strikers, to make a determination whether or not the reinstatement of the strikers who had failed to abide by the requirements of Section 8 (d) whether or not their reinstatement would or would not, in the particular circumstances, effectuate the powers of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="6286.037" offset="25144111">I can't add very much to what Mr. Manoli said in answer to Mr. Justice Black's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.767" offset="25175040">As far as I know, the bill was originally reported, the language originally appeared in S.1126 as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor to the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.456" offset="25257796">In that form, it was a second proviso clause, that is, the section first to find what collective bargaining was generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.090" offset="25296353">Then, it says “provided that where there is a contract, these obligations follow,” and then, at the tail end, in the same position that it is now, it said “provided, further, that any employee who strikes during this period shall fall from the status,” using substantially the words of their mouth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard H. Fitzpatrick</label>
            <text syncTime="6355.969" offset="25423830">It was offered in the Senate by -- it was a committee bill as originally offered in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.210" offset="25456744">I do not know whether it appeared in any of the antecedent bills which went into the makeup of 1126.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.664" offset="25510557">I would like also to comment a moment on, perhaps a little differing concept evoked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question to Mr. Manoli, concerning the relationship between the contract issue and the loss of status issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.511" offset="25594044">I would think that the logical way for this Court to approach the problem would be to consider, first, the loss of status issue because, apparently, that goes to the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.908" offset="25647543">If there are no employees, the Board has no jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding, and the effect of this loss of status clause is to rob these men of whatever status they had as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.791" offset="25715148">I would think that it was rather an absurdity to have the National Labor Relations Board conduct a proceeding to determine whether there were unfair labor practices in order to determine whether or not it had jurisdiction to determine whether there were unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.574" offset="25790276">I would like to say, further, concerning my little passages arms with the Chief Justice, that the arguments used by the Chief Justice were the arguments used in some part by the minority in attacking this piece of legislation in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.662" offset="25906573">I am told by my opponents that the use of minority members are no criterion of what the intent of the legislation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.979" offset="25943876">I merely mention that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.700" offset="25950772">I think it was appropriate that those arguments were used on the other side of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.243" offset="25980970">I think it has no bearing, perhaps, as they say, on the construction of the statute that such arguments exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6506.420" offset="26025587">One other thing, again adverting to a notion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's, expressed in the questioning is the odd mixture of motivations which the Board must unravel in any one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.999" offset="26099984">Now, ordinarily, when you think of unfair labor practices in this connotation, you think of somebody being fired over an issue of discrimination, and that's the simply way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.400" offset="26149512">But, it isn't always the simple way in which an unfair labor practice is -- an unfair labor practice occurs because one of the unfair labor practices is refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.707" offset="26198727">Let us say, the fact situation -- the fact situation based on England -- on Inland Steel case is assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.037" offset="26232059">There, the union came in and asked for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.334" offset="26253270">The employer said, “Well, we will bargain with you on all other demands but we will not bargain with you on your pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.771" offset="26295066">We think that is not a bargainable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.363" offset="26305411">We're not required to bargain under it.”</text>
