            <label>Mr. Sidney A. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="43.806" offset="175125">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.427" offset="185678">The petitioner in this case, Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., has been granted a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.785" offset="219115">This Court originally heard this matter in March of this year and the judgment of the court below, the court below being the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, was affirmed by an equally divided court, Mr. Justice Harlan not being a member of the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.754" offset="306991">Upon reargument having been granted in this case, the same questions and the same briefs are presented to this Court at this time as were before the Court in March of this year and the facts which are projected for this Court's determinations are briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.607" offset="402390">On July 20, 1949, Frank Palazzolo was a longshoreman employed by the petitioner Ryan Stevedoring Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.695" offset="446694">And he was injured on board a certain vessel known as the SS. Canton Victory which at the time of his injury was lying in navigable waters in Brooklyn, New York and the Canton Victory was owned or at least was operated, managed and been controlled by Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.293" offset="529136">He was injured when a roll of paper pulp, which Your Honors may have seen carried on newspaper trucks in the city, jumped out of a bottom tier in a certain hatch or a hold which was known as number three and crossed his leg and he sustained severe injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.251" offset="624953">To recover pecuniary damages, Mr. Palazzolo instituted an action in the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn and that action was brought against Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation in which action and in which complaint, Mr. Palazzolo, the injured longshoreman alleged that Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation was negligent in the manner in which it had loaded and had permitted and suffered a certain stow to be loaded upon its vessel at Charleston, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.833" offset="779285">Now, that stow and particularly hold number 3 had been made by Ryan Stevedoring Company at Charleston, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.573" offset="834247">And I respectfully say to this Court and I think the record will show that at all times the cargo mate who was an employee of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, was in actual control and supervision of the manner in which the cargo was still in this particular hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.693" offset="914704">Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation when it was sued in the state court removed the action to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.866" offset="943438">And after the action had been removed, Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation by a third-party complaint impleaded Ryan Stevedoring Company, the employer of the injured longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.952" offset="999758">And at this point and at the very outset, I would respectfully call the Court's attention to the crux of the third-party complaint of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation against Ryan Stevedoring Company, which is found at page 12 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.598" offset="1086380">Paragraph 10th of the third-party complaint says, “The plaintiff in his complaint has alleged that a pile of rolls of pulp collapsed as a result of which one of them fell upon the plaintiff causing him to sustain severe and permanent injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.050" offset="1164121">It is further alleged that the defendants, their officers, crews, agents, servants and employees caused, suffered and permitted the rolls of pulp to be loaded and transported in a reckless, careless and negligent manner without being properly tiered, piled and secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.474" offset="1241861">As a result of which one of the said piled was cause to collapse and to strike the plaintiff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="316.037" offset="1264118">The plaintiff in his complaint further alleges that he was not furnished with a seaworthy vessel and this is the complaint that Pan-Atlantic makes against Ryan Stevedoring Company, the employer of the injured man.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.645" offset="1318557">The loading of the rolled of paper pulp was performed by the third-party defendant, Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., and at the time, the SS. Canton Victory was turned over to the third-party defendant, Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., said vessel was in a seaworthy condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.327" offset="1381251">If the rolls of pulp were loaded improperly or in a negligent manner without being properly tiered, piled and secured and if the SS. Canton Victory at the times mentioned in the complaint was thus rendered unseaworthy, such unseaworthiness was caused and created solely to the conduct, negligence, carelessness and recklessness of the third-party defendant, Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., its agents, servants and/or employees in the manner in which they performed the aforesaid work and in their failure to make proper preparation and to take proper precautions in the carrying out of the aforesaid work.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.745" offset="1522939">Now, the action came on to the trial before Chief Judge Inch of the United States District Courts for the Eastern District of New York and it was stipulated at the very outset of the trial that the right of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation to recover over as against Ryan Stevedoring Company would be reasserted on the facts and the law for the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.905" offset="1635579">But that all evidence would be adduced at one time and the case which was originally triable by jury would go to the jury only for its determination as to whether the injured longshoreman was entitled to recover as against Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.069" offset="1704229">And so the action was tried and the action went to the jury for its resolution solely against Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation and on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.239" offset="1752921">One, was Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation negligent?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.708" offset="1770789">And two, was the vessel that it operated, managed and controlled unseaworthy?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.097" offset="1792313">The jury brought back a general verdict in the amount of $75,000 against Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.764" offset="1818958">And after that verdict has been rendered, Chief Judge Inch upon the submission of the entire record to him and upon the submission of briefs, determined the right over and he denied a right over in favor of Pan-Atlantic against Ryan Stevedoring Company in an opinion which Your -- Your Honors will find at pages 316 through 319.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.275" offset="1937032">And the crux of Judge Inch's findings, which dictated as far as he was concerned as the trial of the facts, no right of indemnity in favor of Pan-Atlantic, is found at pages 318 and 319 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.083" offset="2012264">And there extensively, Judge Inch refers to the uncontradicted testimony which was elicited from the cargo mate, in which he had testified that he was in overall supervision and control of the loading of the vessel at the port at Charleston, South Carolina and he was in overall supervision and control of the discharging operation here in Brooklyn, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.160" offset="2132637">I might indicate to the Court that he testified time and time again that he was in the hold at the time of the loading of hold number three and that he actually saw the bottom tier from which this one pile -- one roll came out and injured the plaintiff being stowed and that it was stowed to his entire satisfaction, if it had not been, he would have complained and would have seen that the work should be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.062" offset="2260219">In addition to that, the proof shows that this cargo mate was in the hold at the very time of the happening of the accident here in Brooklyn and that he was in there for 5 to 10 minutes and had seen the actual Stevedoring operation going on and that as far as he was concerned, everything that Ryan had done was done properly to his satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.284" offset="2353110">And Judge Inch denied a right over and he said in his opinion, in view of this testimony which he outlined at length dealing with what the cargo mate had testified to, “It is plain that Pan-Atlantic's cargo officer did not perform his admitted duty to supervise the safe and careful loading of the vessel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="610.940" offset="2443703">Now, I should indicate at this time that there was a question of law raised before the trial court which he did not decide and that was whether the statute which we had invoked, the U.S. Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and specifically Section 5 of the Act whether that was a bar to any claim of indemnity implied in law and I should indicate also at this time that this case presents a question of indemnity implied in law amongst other questions, there being no express contract of indemnity between the third-party plaintiff and the third-party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.513" offset="2617992">There is simply a contractual arrangement which was evidenced by letters that Ryan Stevedoring Company for an agreed price with stevedore, the vessels of the Pan-Atlantic at the various ports in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.462" offset="2705763">And as I understand that term and as I understand Judge Inch's decision, he found that Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation had been held negligent by the jury on the basis of the cargo mate's testimony as to his control of the situation, having been loaded to his satisfaction which the jury didn't find to be satisfactory and he also found that Ryan Stevedoring Company was negligent also so that both of them actively and affirmatively participated in bringing the injury to Palazzolo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.887" offset="4019513">We think this error, the trial court found Pan-Atlantic guilty of negligence and that its cargo officer did not properly perform his admitted duty to supervise the safe and careful loading of the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.654" offset="4154514">So that both courts, the District Court and the Court of Appeals have both held that the record shows Pan-Atlantic to be both negligent and to have furnished an unseaworthy vessel and the jury so determined as far as Pan-Atlantic was concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.575" offset="5258240">And in disposing of the petition there for indemnity, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit merely said the dismissal of the cross libel against Turner and Blanchard, who in that case was the employer and who was the respondent impleaded which paid libellant under the provisions of the Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was without error 33 U.S.C.A. Section 905.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.669" offset="5418632">And there, the Court of Appeals in denying contribution said, “To impose a non-contractural duty of contribution on the employer is pro tanto to deprive him of the immunity which the statute grants him in exchange for his absolute though limited liability to secure compensation to his employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.455" offset="5501806">And Chief Judge Learned Hand in a concurring opinion said that the statute was a release and he said it in these words, “And the reason why I think it should be so construe is that it has imposed upon employers an absolute though limited liability in exchanged for a release from the preceding unlimited liability, conditional upon negligence.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.535" offset="8690103">I say it's unique because ordinarily, this whole problem of whose insurance company pays the loss or who pays the loss if they have enough insurance is taken care of by the contract between the ship and the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.704" offset="8762723">That's the ordinary case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.274" offset="9689025">Now, he wasn't there all of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.207" offset="9696758">That's the first point in writing my brief because I suspected there was going to be a lot of talk about what the mate did and he didn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.656" offset="9730612">I very carefully keyed to the record at pages 4 and 5 of my brief exactly what the mate did do and this is what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.694" offset="9766766">First of all, to recreate that picture, there was this cargo being loaded simultaneously into five different hatches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.100" offset="9808353">One mate, the loading took 20 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.869" offset="9827474">This particular mate that Judge Inch talks about was there for 4 of the 20 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.581" offset="9854224">Now, what did he have to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.824" offset="9867285">Well, he couldn't spend all of his time in any one hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.212" offset="9884839">This happened -- to have occurred in number three, but he had five hatches to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.133" offset="9912529">He had no authority to direct any of Ryan's men in the manner of loading the cargo and did not supervise the detail of the stow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.694" offset="9950772">This question of supervision is just the other way around in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.395" offset="9965505">He didn't supervise it, indeed he couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.872" offset="9979402">He testified and nobody questioned him that there were proper chocks on the vessel and the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.250" offset="10000927">Now, the mate said he'd seen them use proper chocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.024" offset="10016078">Came the witnesses for the injured longshoreman and they said, oh, no, this weren't properly chocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.876" offset="10039484">The chocks underneath them weren't adequate chocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.107" offset="10056411">But now, from time to time during the loading of this cargo, he couldn't know as a matter of fact and as a matter good sense whether Ryan had chocked them or he hadn't, why, because as each roll was put in place and the chocks are put under it, you roll the next -- roll along side of it, you can't see whether its chock now or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.640" offset="10134465">This mate was in and out of five holes, presumptively, the only one on watch for 4 of the 20 hours and that is the activity which Mr. Schwartz constitutes as some active affirmative negligence which even Judge Inch didn't find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.531" offset="10210116">And I'll tell Your Honor what Judge Inch did find and why this question became so important as to unseaworthiness and negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.003" offset="10343967">That is what the original plaintiff had asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.959" offset="10359745">That is the issue we had tried and that was the issue the jury was to pass on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.757" offset="10559007">Oh, that is a fundamental fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.602" offset="10574367">It has been decided by a jury that the stow was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.716" offset="10590772">Now, the next question comes if the stow was bad, where do we get by separating negligence and unseaworthiness?</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.604" offset="10630374">That was one of my big complaints before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and one of the things that I thought required the result that we did achieve there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.377" offset="10681469">We are all familiar with a difference between negligence and unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.874" offset="10707487">This Court has written of course unseaworthiness is the species of liability without any fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.008" offset="10731938">And certainly, negligence has in its essence some fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.529" offset="10754090">When the judge charged the jury here, he put those two concepts into a pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.104" offset="10792333">He intermingled them and he intermingled them so that no lawyer and certainly no layman could separate them and he threw that issue to the jury as one whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.402" offset="10841548">And when the jury verdict came back, holding the stow was bad because that was the fact issue, then when it came time to find out about my rights over against the stevedore then he started for the first time to separate negligence and unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.969" offset="10919811">And to go on this theory of negligence which has now been characterized as active or something of that type in order to put a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.990" offset="10967876">He made no fact finding we were joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.951" offset="10979788">He put a legal label upon an admitted set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.318" offset="11005179">But I thought of course he ignored the contractual relationship between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.911" offset="11027644">The fact that we had a binding agreement was utterly ignored and so he went exclusively to find out if somehow or rather he could put negligence on us, although when he gave it to a jury, he threw it to the jury in one piece, negligence and unseaworthiness intermingled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.591" offset="11114266">That was one of my first and greatest and sincerest complaints in the Court of Appeals, that with that posture of the case, it really wasn't fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.669" offset="11158674">It was almost like changing the rules in the middle of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.861" offset="11171422">If there wasn't any difference between unseaworthiness and negligence as far as the plaintiff against me, now why should you start to chop him in half when you look for my claim over -- against the stevedore?</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.134" offset="11228473">Now, what did Judge Inch actually find?</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.920" offset="11239654">He found the mate failed to discover that these people had done a poor job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.363" offset="11257417">That's what he held against us and that's all he held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.045" offset="11272150">And here's what he wrote that the cargo officer in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered and corrected the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.321" offset="11309244">In other words, we didn't find out that these people would do -- had done a bad job when they have been paid to do a good work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.245" offset="11348950">When we've got into the Court of the Appeals, the Court unanimously could find two basis upon either one of which we were entitled to have in fact whatever this accident had caused us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.372" offset="11413420">One basis might be called court, the law of active and passive negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.818" offset="11439229">The theory having been expressed in the Second Circuit and in other courts on many occasions that if the conduct of two persons has contributed or caused an event and the one has been the primary or active or substantially responsible and the other merely negligent in a negative or passive way that the Court will work out contribution and the hold the one harmless and for whom it -- him who was negative and who failed to do this and failed to do that to reproof his damage from the one who is active.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.565" offset="11606204">But I never briefed substantially or urged in this Court a great deal on that subject because the Court of Appeals found something I thought was so unimpeachable that if Your Honor's could find one basis of soundness for the conclusion they had reached that that would dispose the problem and that's the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.161" offset="11708604">I think it's so sound but there is no brief in opposition to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.482" offset="11733891">The point is simply this, that if I hire an expert to do a job by his -- hire someone because of their peculiar skill or knowledge, it's understood they'll do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.085" offset="11796271">Now, there isn't anything particularly maritime about that, it lies to affairs on the land as well as on the sea if I hire a man to repair the raptures in my house so the roof won't fall in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.978" offset="11851860">I don't have to put down in lawyer's language or with seals or ribbons that he will do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.540" offset="11878087">That's an implied part of his undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.613" offset="11890416">So in this case, it was an implied part of the undertaking that Ryan as a special, let's say, stevedore embarked upon that they do a good job in stowing the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.746" offset="11938900">Now, they did a bad job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.346" offset="11945378">The juries found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.868" offset="11951438">The stow was poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.804" offset="11959171">They breached their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.811" offset="11967216">I don't think they deny it and so -- well, if they come here to do is to confess and avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.462" offset="11993757">Yes, we breached our contract but because we fulfilled our obligation to our employees, we -- we don't owe you anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.605" offset="12038374">Because of 905 of the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act, we've been good to our employees and therefore we can't be held liable for breach of contract or a suit for rent or such other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.670" offset="12090619">What the whole argument fails to see is that there are these two separate and distinct lines of obligation to which Mr. Justice Reed referred a few moments ago, that as an employer, Ryan did oath to Palazzolo, an employee, certain obligations and put to us in the status of contract with us being the other point, they owed us some obligations too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.862" offset="12195422">And when they satisfied their obligations to Palazzolo, what sense is there for them to say, “We owe you nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.079" offset="12224261">We owe our landlord nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.427" offset="12229695">We owe no one else in the world anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.438" offset="12241711">Because the effect of the argument here about 905 is that this immunity runs in favor of the whole world that a stevedore procuring compensation to his employees can't be guilty of breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.304" offset="12309211">Now, that's the basis of the first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.503" offset="12321959">What's wrong with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.954" offset="12331781">Mr. Justice Frankfurter has referred a few minutes ago to looking at a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.834" offset="12359262">I'm not reading it too literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.446" offset="12373682">I say let us look at the history of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.780" offset="12383086">Let's look at the history of this statute in this Court, what had this Court done that caused this statute to come into being?</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.107" offset="12424359">Back in 1913, an attempt was made to bring a longshoreman in under the New York State Workmen's Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.573" offset="12462289">It was as far back as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.763" offset="12475037">When the case came up here, this Court held that you couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.510" offset="12498024">That longshoremen where engaged in the maritime work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.580" offset="12518296">They work to be governed by maritime considerations and it is our maritime policy that there'd be uniformity, that you couldn't apply a state law of workmen's compensation whether it was promulgated by one state or another or a fourth or a fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.499" offset="12593946">And so in the Jensen case, this Court held that wouldn't be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.169" offset="12608575">You couldn't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.123" offset="12620487">So Congress tried to get a workmen's compensation law in for longshoremen and they tried it in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.531" offset="12654028">They amended the Judiciary Act, a couple of years later, to give jurisdiction to admiralty courts of claims by injured workmen under state compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.692" offset="12706691">The constitutionality of that was challenged and this Court said, “No, you can't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.827" offset="12731246">You can't blank in it 48 different state compensation laws, you've got to have uniformity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.973" offset="12759876">So Congress tried to get another workmen's compensation law through for longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.896" offset="12779520">Mind you, we're talking about workmen's compensation and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.415" offset="12797597">They put in the so-called Mills amendment, again trying to blank it into a federal system, the different workmen's compensation laws of the 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.296" offset="12841169">And again this Court said, “You can't do it that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.785" offset="12851096">And then this Court said how it could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.661" offset="12866560">Congress would have to enact a workmen's compensation law that would be a uniform application throughout the United States and with that history and that background of attempts to put into effect the workmen's compensation law, finally in 1927, this Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act came into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.542" offset="12958093">If it was anything more than a definition of the rights and remedies of employer and employee, there wasn't anything in its history that would indicate that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.563" offset="13010233">Now, we are interested in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.638" offset="13018488">What did the -- they say about in the Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.606" offset="13030400">Any Congressman have any different ideas as to what this statute meant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.682" offset="13046700">And the answer is that the petitioner admits there wasn't a word on it at anytime while this was going on in Congress for years that would support the idea that they were doing anything except dealing in the field of employer-employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.320" offset="13117231">And certainly, I think that any of those legislators would be amazed to hear that this legislation between employer and employee is now sought to be some sort of -- have some effect upon the rights of a contractor, landlord and tenant or who knows what when all that Congress said -- about to do was to put a workmen's compensation law into this maritime field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.328" offset="13229244">Now, so far as the generalities of the situation are concerned as much has been said about Hydra-headed litigation, that there's something wrong here, that something about the conduit theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.209" offset="13328823">That indirectly something is being done that can't be done directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.920" offset="13351602">I -- I'm trying to admit that at first blush sometimes that looks that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.117" offset="13380441">But actually by our use of third-party practice, I don't think that all procedural mode of operation can obscure the two lines of rights which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.824" offset="13439269">Indeed, the Court of Appeals in New York many, many years ago, and to let the problem with our own workmen's compensation law and which indeed is the basis of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.595" offset="13498305">It's modeled after our New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.127" offset="13508441">They held that that won't bare analysis that after all an employee has rights against his employer and those are solved by the compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.454" offset="13545744">But when it comes to the obligations of that man, no longer as an employer but as a contractor, he's got to stand on his own feet and he can't point to a satisfaction to these other obligations.</text>
