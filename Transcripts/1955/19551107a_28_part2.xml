            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Alderman</label>
            <text syncTime="3.489" offset="13897">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.407" offset="37616">I was referring to the decision itself by the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.463" offset="69799">On my brief, the gray brief, pages 8 to 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.121" offset="100415">I admitted very careful, restatements of the case and of the holding of the court below with pertinent quotations beginning at page 11, and on page 12, from the Court's language in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.973" offset="179827">In the first quoted paragraph, it will be observed that the Court did not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the District Court as to what precise amount of damages were justifiable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.307" offset="245133">The District Court said 60 was excessive, 50 was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.291" offset="269061">The Court of Appeals dealt with the evidence in the case, they admitted the evidence as to contribution the actual evidence, and it dealt with what in railroad rate problems as often referred to as the zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.784" offset="339069">It fixed the zone of reasonableness for the damages from bottom -- it gets $18,000 to $19,000 and top brackets which it describe as fantastic on the evidence of $38,000 to $39,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.043" offset="440111">Leaving it for a subsequent jury trial to fix something reasonable in that zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.183" offset="480653">Far from denying to this plaintiff a jury trial, the Court dealt liability issues as well as damage issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.067" offset="520255">Both courts held that the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury to find the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.740" offset="558916">The Court of Appeals reversed for a jury trial on the issue of damages alone, the most perfect situation in which a plaintiff in a damage suit can be whether defendant has no defense on negligence or liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.430" offset="637701">As a frightful matter, if this Court affirms the court below, that's what will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.571" offset="666227">Plaintiff will have a new jury trial under those favorable circumstances on damages alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.457" offset="697783">Maybe he has new evidence, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.437" offset="717740">The other alternative, if this Court should hold, and I think it would be a most serious holding, that is there is no appellate jurisdiction or power in the federal judiciary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.298" offset="781166">To review a judge for abusive discretion, a trial judge on the matter of this kind, but then this Court would reverse the Court of Appeals below and it would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Alderman</label>
            <text syncTime="216.438" offset="865698">That's the phrase that the Court of Appeals below used, and I was leading up to inviting you to the language of that court in the middle of page 12 as quoted in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.363" offset="925362">Its ultimate conclusion was a total contribution of $50,000 by young Neese to his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.519" offset="962038">And he and they lived out there with normal expectancy, seems to us far beyond the pale of any reasonable probability and entirely without support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.655" offset="1022537">Then he cited cases from the Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, from other Circuits and particularly the 1948 decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals this same Court in the Virginian Railway against Armentrout.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.888" offset="1095471">And the -- and the Court quoted from the Armentrout case this language, which is its statement of what it understands the law to be and the law as it applies perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.416" offset="1141656">Much more better than the argument act it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.551" offset="1158165">The Court of Appeals below said, ordinarily, of course, the amount of damages is for the jury, and whether a verdict should be set aside as excessive is a matter resting into the discretion of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.755" offset="1222949">This, however, is not an arbitrary but a sound discretion to be exercised in the light of the record in the case and within the limits prescribed by reasoning and experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.883" offset="1287523">And where a verdict is so excessive, that it cannot be justified by anything in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.507" offset="1313959">All of which the Court can take judicial notice, it is the duty of the judge, that is the trial judge, to set is aside, failure to do so is an abusive discretion analogous to error of law and as such reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.959" offset="1391804">Now that's the very question which Mr. Justice Brandeis to this Court pre-committed and reserve for future decision in Paramount Glassworks case, and I remind the Court that that case was decided in 1933, I will come to hit its historical setting in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.228" offset="8380813">It's now 1291 of the United States Code, Title 28, 1952 edition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.479" offset="8857913">September 24 and 25, 1789 or perhaps two of the most significant days in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.075" offset="8900232">The first Congress -- first session at that time was dealing with two documents of the greatest importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.697" offset="8930743">First was the Judiciary Act which established the federal judiciary and regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.407" offset="8953626">The other was 12 proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.200" offset="8980793">The Judiciary Act and the proposed amendments went through the legislative history of that Congress almost hand in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.739" offset="9018932">They were considered in the light of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.519" offset="9033979">There were two views in that Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.511" offset="9042024">One was that the Judiciary Act should be affixed first and then the amendments passed upon in the light of the Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.554" offset="9078178">Others thought vice versa, but they did go hand in hand and that was the most extraordinary effort that's harmonizing the Judiciary Act and the proposed amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.979" offset="9131886">You recall that the first two of 12 proposed amendments whenever ratified by the States so they became the first 10 Amendments of the Bill of Rights and proposed amendment nine became Amendment Seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.882" offset="9203461">Now that very Congress in that very Judiciary Act while they put in Section 22 which is common on -- on Mr. Justice Brandeis in Fairmount, also carried Sections 17 -- Section 17 I've quoted on page 38 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.761" offset="9286949">And I think it's a profound significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.681" offset="9302622">The Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of Appeals -- oh I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.000" offset="9347971">I picked up the wrong words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.040" offset="9368137">Oh, page 34 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.212" offset="9384751">Section 17 of the original Judiciary Act provided this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.206" offset="9408784">That all of the said courts of the United States, District Court, Circuit Courts, and this Court, appellate courts and trial courts, that all of the said courts of United States shall have power to grant new trials in cases where there has been a trial by jury for reasons for which new trials have used it and granted in the courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.629" offset="9510452">Now at that point on page 34 of my brief is the defect in my research.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.486" offset="9533858">I said that that language remand the same except for a comma that was properly put in by the Act of 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.811" offset="9571161">I was wrong about the comma was put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.642" offset="9586521">The phrase was properly punctuated by revised statutes Section 726 of 1878 and then the Act -- the Act of 1911 added that second summons quoted on the middle of my page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.061" offset="9668232">Another defect and a more serious one in the research set out on my brief is that I should have shown how long these two provisions, Section 17 and Section 22 of the original Judiciary Act, remained hand in hand in the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.524" offset="9766034">They remained there together until 1948 under when reversal was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.230" offset="10060904">The other was dealing with the matter in fact as the old language had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.063" offset="10088176">But one article clearly discloses that the purpose of Section 22 in the Original Act was identical with the purpose of the Seventh Amendment, merely, to prevent the Courts of Appeals from ruling or reversing on pure questions of fact as distinguished from questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.695" offset="10186710">Or, not only was I think those two documents, the first judiciary act and the first ten amendments or the -- proposed first twelve passed by the same Congress constitute probably the most extraordinary mutual contemporaneous practical construction of each other by two documents in all history that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.091" offset="10304261">Not only does it clearly appear that there was no conflict between Section 17 and 22 in the most rabid anti-federalist never raised his voice against Section 17 declaring that all of the said Courts of the United States shall have the power to grant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.600" offset="10390361">But Congress evidently saw no conflict between the two and both of them remained in the Judicial Code until 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.570" offset="10438217">And I do think that that's a considerable significance as bearing on the historical problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.537" offset="10990132">I based my argument on the constitutional point squarely on Galloway against United States, the most recent case in which this Court has dealt with the Seventh Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.784" offset="11047079">In that case Mr. Justice (Inaudible) writing for this Court, absolutely fairly assimilated as raising exactly equivalent questions of law subject to appellate review that the merit of the evidence the motion to set aside the verdict for a new trial and motion for direction of verdict and one other as raising exactly equivalent questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.554" offset="11186155">This Court held that there was no inconsistency between an appellate court dealing with that kind of question of law in the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.056" offset="11232131">And throughout that case, depending of this Court stresses the fact that's led the practice applies to a motion for a new trial to set aside the verdict and for new trial equally with direction of verdict for one of the sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict and they all (Inaudible) to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.319" offset="11337247">I take a careful consideration of that case in the light of this case will answer any constitution problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.708" offset="11398792">What is the question of law and what is what counsel referred to as a factual question?</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.461" offset="11441842">I don't know of any questions of law that arise except directly or indirectly out of factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.912" offset="11483638">If that were not true, there would be very little for this Court or any other appellate court to decide these questions of law if you could not deal with a question which directly or indirectly proceeds from factual considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.282" offset="11553123">But in my opinion for a United States Court of Appeals to review and reverse a district trial judge for abuse of discretion on the ground that he has approved the verdict and refuse to set it aside which is not warranted by the evidence and write in the case and it's beyond the bail of all reasonableness is distinctly a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.634" offset="11670465">If that'd be true and I feel that it is, there's no violation of the Seventh Amendment for the very same reason that there's no violation of -- even the original provision 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.163" offset="11752594">I feel that the decision in the Galloway case is dispositive of this case on both questions.</text>
