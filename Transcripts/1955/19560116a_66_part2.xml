            <text syncTime="79.398" offset="317544">And if they had intended that it'd be a mere matter of the place where found, then it would have abolished the word residents entirely and to put the defendants entirely on the word found.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.511" offset="550034">That question may have to be decided as well is whether the state rule, the technical meaning of doing business is using that language will be applicable in a federal question case.Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="230.423" offset="921600">Now, it is not procedural in the sense of the manner in which the Court has conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.322" offset="945215">It is a right, which is -- has its outcome determinative effect and the doctrine of Erie versus Tompkins has its vitality because of the versatility that it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.063" offset="1000176">And that drives out versatility, I believe, from the decisions of this Court and this Court has not have difficulty over this simple distinction between substantive and procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.902" offset="1055556">It went to the fact of what would happen and whether or not the case would have preceded in the state court or whether it would not have proceeded in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.385" offset="1105502">And the decisions have made it plain that it is -- that is the result of this to be the criterion and not any narrow question of technical meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.154" offset="1168614">The -- the importance here in this case of not adopting an exception to the Erie rule has very plainly brought out by the fact that you can treat this thing if you want under a technical term of procedure but the result would be diametrically opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.436" offset="1261714">The case would proceed in the federal court while they block down the street and the state court case would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.386" offset="1289509">And that is a sort of thing Erie doctrine is applicable to.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.820" offset="1307272">And as I say, the vitality of a doctrine has always depended upon the versatility that this Court has been able to give to it and I don't think it would be any difficulty at all in applying the general principle of the doctrine in this case.</text>
