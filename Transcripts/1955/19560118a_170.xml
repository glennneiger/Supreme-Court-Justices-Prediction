            <label>Mr. Aaron Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="15.810" offset="63216">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.260" offset="80980">This is an appeal by certiorari for the Court of Appeals Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.730" offset="106893">The petitioner, General Stores Corporation, seeks to reverse the -- the decision by an -- a divided bench of that Court which affirmed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.660" offset="154540">The Court of Appeals held that the debtor in this case, which filed the petition on arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act with its unsecured commercial and trade creditors, cannot proceed in Chapter XI unless the debtor amended its petition to comply with the requirements for a corporate reorganization under Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.024" offset="296020">In filing its petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI, the debtor was seeking first an extension of time for the payment of its general, unsecured and commercial trade debts, and during the pendency of the proceeding, it hoped to obtain the liquidation of the balance of its very burdensome leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.490" offset="433946">General Stores was formerly known as the D. A. Schulte, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.196" offset="456725">It operated a large chain of the small shops selling tobacco and sundry offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.306" offset="493192">As a result of the gradual change in merchandising in that type of business and perhaps the borrowing habits of the public, the company decided that if it continued in that type of business it meant financial disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.616" offset="570410">It decided that it would be necessary that it acquire successfully, established chain drugstore outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.676" offset="622655">This aim, on the part of the debtor company, was accomplished in 1953, and in 1954, by the purchase for some $4 million of the Ford Hopkins Company that had about 56 or 57 chains of drugstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.071" offset="716278">And the purchase of the Stineway Company that had approximately the same number of retail drugstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.755" offset="754939">Now, the acquisition of these two successfully established chains indicated to the debtor company a return of approximately 17% on the investment or the rather the purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.315" offset="829231">And it should be noted that this 17% was anticipated to be a net return, a close to a net return because of the benefits of the tax laws carry forward that the company hoped to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.609" offset="902374">The continued operation by the debtor of its remaining used units that it had and the very substantial expense that was occasioned by its burdensome leases was gradually resulting in a point arriving where it was unable to pay its commercial and trade debts as they were maturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.390" offset="1009476">In order to obtain the relief from its inability to pay its commercial debts as they were maturing, this debtor filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.160" offset="1080633">General Stores is a public stock corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.073" offset="1100278">It has but one class of stock, common.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.513" offset="1118041">The stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.803" offset="1131207">Part of the stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.233" offset="1156911">There are about 2 million shares of this common stock outstanding that has a par value of $1 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.263" offset="1188989">And there are approximately 7000 shareholders in all, the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.258" offset="1220963">Now, except for this common stock issue, there is no other stock or security whatsoever issued by this debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.599" offset="1274358">At the time that the petition was filed for an arrangement, the debtor owed about $2 million to the former owners of the stock of the Ford Hopkins Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.909" offset="1339559">This debt, which represented the balance owing on the purchase price, was secured by all of the stock of the Ford Hopkins Company and by all of the stock of the Stineway Drug Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.186" offset="1396715">This is the only secured debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.006" offset="1415941">And, of course, this obligation to this secured creditor was not to be affected by the proposed plan of arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.151" offset="1460558">In addition, this debtor owed to general unsecured, merchandise and trade creditors an amount somewhat in excess of $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.061" offset="1516147">It also owed to its wholly owned subsidiary, the Stineway Drug Company $1,300,000 representing moneys borrowed from time to time from that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.532" offset="1578109">The assets at the time of the filing of the petition amounted to about $5 million and consisted of the capital stock of the two wholly owned subsidiaries, the Ford Hopkins and the Stineway Drug at about $4 million an inventory cash and other miscellaneous assets of about $1,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.193" offset="1688764">Now, the plan of arrangement filed by the General Stores proposed an extension only for the payment of its generally unsecured merchandise and trade debts as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.767" offset="1758981">20% in cash upon the confirmation of the plan, 20% annually thereafter over the next four-year period and the only obligations affected by this propose plan of the general unsecured commercial and trade debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.527" offset="1846021">They're represented here by the creditors committee and by the attorney for the wage claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.367" offset="1881443">The Commission moved in the District Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="473.497" offset="1893982">In other words, it was then that the arrangement touched only these unsecured creditors and therefore, if General Stores had gone on with the business subject to eventuality of the (Inaudible) events seems nothing new, the situation of the stockholders will remain the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.424" offset="1977678">And there were no other security holders of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.774" offset="1998994">Now, the Commission moved in the District Court for leave to intervene in the Chapter XI proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.101" offset="2028356">And it asked that the petition be dismissed which was filed for an arrangement unless it was amended to comply with the provisions of Chapter X for corporate reorganization as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.541" offset="2086139">Now, the reasons advanced by the Commission and the basis of its motion is its contention that Chapter XI is not available for corporations with publicly held securities.</text>

            <label>Mr. Aaron Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="583.854" offset="2335347">Well, I -- I can best answer that question this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.984" offset="2351856">After this stockholder, Shlensky started the proceedings then for the first time, that the Security and Exchange Commission stepped in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.382" offset="2385502">It was made a party to the proceedings by the motion of this small stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.774" offset="2415073">The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals granted the motion of the Commission on the grounds that a large corporation with publicly held stock may not have an arrangement -- may not have an arrangement with unsecured creditors regardless of the plan through Chapter XI proceedings but that it must resort to a corporate reorganization through Chapter X so that the appraisal of the Commission could be obtained by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.711" offset="2586749">Neither of the courts below found any express statutory provision in Chapter XI which excludes a large corporation with publicly held stock from seeking an arrangement with general unsecured commercial and trade creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.200" offset="2664699">Both courts and the Commission in this Court rely exclusively upon their interpretation of this Court's decision in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.427" offset="2729691">We believe that it must be conceded that nowhere in Chapter XI is it expressly provided that large corporations with publicly held stock issues cannot file a petition for an arrangement under that Chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.583" offset="2802312">And we believe that it must further be conceded that on -- on at least three occasions, Congress was faced with the suggestion to so legislate and Congress refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.553" offset="2858109">The first occasion was in the formative stages of the Chandler Act in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.710" offset="2894785">At that time a special committee of Congress recommended that the acting clue to provision that large corporations with publicly held stock of over 100 stockholders should not be or should be excluded from the benefits of Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.270" offset="2977019">It was not enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.640" offset="2986527">The second occasion was in 1940 after the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the U.S. Realty case held that there was no exclusion in Chapter XI from the large corporations with publicly held securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.155" offset="3068552">At that time, a bill was introduced in Congress to exclude such corporations from the benefit of Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.095" offset="3108362">Congress again failed to enact any such exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.463" offset="3137829">The third occasion was in 1952, and that was after this Court's decision in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.393" offset="3177535">And particularly after it was noted from Mr. Justice Stone's pointing it out in the U.S. Realty case that there was a lack in the statute of any definition of a large corporation with publicly held securities on which definition the Court could find the basis for an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.312" offset="3285159">Congress at that time codified one aspect of the U.S. Realty decision but again failed to enact in Chapter XI any exclusion against large corporations with publicly held securities.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="837.214" stopTime="855.554">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="837.214" offset="3348793">Mr. Rosen, your burden to establish that or proceeding under Chapter X is forbidden by Chapter X, in order to establish the -- an arrangement under Chapter XI is allowable.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.554" offset="3422145">Had this corporation filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter X seeking in that proceeding, only an adjustment or extension of its commercial and trade debts, it would not have been filed in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.136" offset="3500513">And the statute says that when the Court receives a petition for reorganization and before it approves it, it must find that it's filed in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.036" offset="3576059">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.726" offset="3578880">And as I'd like to finish my answer to your question, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it is considered bad faith if the relief requested under Chapter X, had this company filed the petition for reorganization, could have been granted under Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.993" offset="3667905">Now, if I may, in the absence of any statutory exclusion of large corporations with publicly held securities, what are the substantive criteria for dismissing a proceeding in Chapter XI which would justify excluding certain corporations?</text>
            <text syncTime="942.260" offset="3768947">The only substantive rule for dismissing a petition is, and it always has been, contained right within the Act in Section 376 and Section 366 of Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.200" offset="3832790">Section 376 empowers the Court to dismiss the petition wherever the plan fails of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.639" offset="3882527">Section 366 states the conditions of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.738" offset="3910949">Now, the conditions for confirmation at the time of the U.S. Realty case was that the Court be satisfied that the plan was fair and equitable and in the best interest of creditors also feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.305" offset="3997153">At that time, if the Court was not satisfied in either point, the plan could not be confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.871" offset="4039471">And the Court was empowered to dismiss the proceedings right in the Section 376.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.642" offset="4070504">This was statutory law and that was the law we submit which the majority of this Court applied in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.162" offset="4112614">As a matter of substantive law, the majority opinion stated that the most important consideration was that the plan by affecting unsecured guarantee of the mortgage certificate holders without compensating advantage, contributed -- contributed by stockholders couldn't confirm such a plan under any circumstances because it was not fair and equitable under the Boyd and the case in Los -- Los Angeles Lumber case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.552" offset="4262139">Secondarily, the Court said, and found, as a matter of discretion, that in view of the Securities Act of 1933, it could not be satisfied as to what was for the best interest of creditor without an appraisal and a report from the Securities and Exchange Commission who, under the Securities Act of 1933, were the special guardians of the particular creditors that were affected by the plan in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.284" offset="4429113">Now, what is there in the U.S. Realty case which could justify this Court in excluding the General Stores from the benefits of Chapter XI on the facts, the two cases are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.304" offset="4509153">The decision in the U.S. Realty case, I submit, was based on the facts peculiar for that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.468" offset="6201783">It just hadn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.071" offset="6208261">Because you couldn't tear down or pay less to general creditors under that rule without some compensating benefit being paid by the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.814" offset="6255177">It is our contention that the majority holding in the U.S. Realty case is based upon the inadequacy of Chapter XI to confirm the plan that was presented by the U.S. Realty Company in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.414" offset="6329574">And Mr. Justice Stone, after making the observations which existed in that case that Chapter XI was not intended for the large corporation with public securities, said, "Still more important are the differences in the remedies obtainable under the two chapters which results from the differences in the nature of the two proceedings and in the securities affected by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.382" offset="6493518">We believe that we're confirmed in our opinion as to the basis of the U.S. Realty decision by the fact that Congress, in 1952, changed the standards for confirming a plan in Chapter XI, rather than in enacting any legislation which would exclude large corporations with publicly held stock from the benefits of that chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.300" offset="6613159">This Court in the U.S. Realty case pointed out that the fair and equitable rule as I stated made it almost impossible to confirm a plan of arrangement without affecting stockholders who therefore, must be permitted to become parties to the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.028" offset="6688078">And that couldn't be done under Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.374" offset="6709394">In 1952, Congress removed the fair and equitable requirement for confirmation of arrangements under Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.815" offset="6751190">And it removed the necessity for making stockholders parties affected by the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.831" offset="6811272">Well, I -- I see that my time is getting very close and I would like to state, if I may to the Court, the five important points that we stress for the reversal of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.259" offset="6868950">The first is, that there's nothing contained in the statute which excludes large corporations with publicly held securities from the benefits of Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.013" offset="6924016">My second point is, the only substantive criteria for the dismissal of petitions under Chapter XI are contained within the law itself, Section 376 and Section 366 as I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.316" offset="6997264">My third point is that, the Court, this Court in the U.S. Realty case did not add to the criteria for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.667" offset="7034567">It merely applied the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.990" offset="7051912">And my fourth point is that the result in the U.S. Realty case does not apply to our case at all, because as Justice Stone stated in the U.S. Realty case, the important consideration is the plan which adversely affected the public security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.664" offset="7154625">And my last and final point, is that the 1952 Amendment, which is Section 328, did not add any additional criteria for the dismissal of the petition by -- by saying large corporations are excluded or certain types of corporations are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.448" offset="7245740">It merely added a procedural remedy from that portion of the U.S. Realty case which was codified and nothing else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.789" offset="7395056">There are 174 wage claimants here with claims approximating a quarter of a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.462" offset="7429747">There are also priorities totalling some approximate $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.210" offset="7456810">Now, pursuant to Chapter XI Section 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act, these claimants are entitled to a priority which amounts to this $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.407" offset="7501531">Now, under the order and the judgment appealed from, these wage claimants are completely deprived of this priority if the order below and the judgment below are left to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.415" offset="7549597">Because under the provisions of Chapter X, Section 102 of the Bankruptcy Act, it is specifically provided that Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act shall not be applicable to proceedings under Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.752" offset="7610932">Now, the order of the District Court is self-executing in that either the petitioner change or amend its petition to Chapter X or it be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.344" offset="7657326">And were to be dismissed, we would automatically lose this priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.565" offset="7682194">Now, the wage earners therefore, would be left at the mercy either of the debtor where he -- were it to amend to Chapter X or at the mercy of the general unsecured creditors were they to file an involuntary petition for bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.289" offset="7749068">Now, the rights of these wage earners can only be protected by a continuation of the Chapter XI proceedings or by an adjudication of the debtor under the direction of said proceedings be continued as a straight bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.995" offset="7807896">Now, I need not point out to this Court that the wage earners have been under the special protection of Congress and the courts and there are many, many cases have been cited in our brief in conformity with this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.219" offset="8080823">Now, of the quarter million dollars only $90,000 represents a priority approximately $155,000 represents general unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.578" offset="8122305">We would come in under both phases of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.371" offset="8133381">However, it is our contention that we do not want to lose this very real advantage we have of having a priority because all of these wage earners no longer work for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.368" offset="8185417">Many of them have worked as long as 30 years, have spent their lifetime on this particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.254" offset="8208927">Many of them are not employable elsewhere and this small sum of money represents to many the savings that they may have accumulated over 30 years of employment with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.777" offset="8259082">Now, it is apparent that the provisions granting these priorities to wage earners are the result of considerations of social policy by the Congress and has been enunciated in several of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.871" offset="8307461">And it's our contention that the Court should give special consideration to the congressional policies intended by this statutory enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.181" offset="8344660">Now, we must consider the impact of the order and judgment appealed from below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.047" offset="8364095">We have 174 families affected directly and adversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.473" offset="8381858">Some of these claims total, some odd $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.757" offset="8395024">Some $1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.758" offset="8402965">These people have not received that money since the debtor has filed its petition on October 18th, 1954, some 15 or 16 months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.252" offset="8452911">Now, if the petition is amended to a Chapter XI, it is without question established from experience that a Chapter X proceeding would take a considerable time in the appointment of a trustee, his attorney in going on to examine all the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.511" offset="8521979">We might then have a situation where this would continue for an even greater period of time that we have had today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.639" offset="8554475">And it is our contention therefore, that since no other creditor seeks the reversal or rather seeks the change from XI to X that the judgment below should be reversed and should be permitted to stay in Chapter XI.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.147" offset="8896575">Now, the creditors in this case feel that the decisions below are oddly irreconcilable with fundamental principle of bankruptcy in corporate law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.272" offset="8941087">And that is of the rights of stockholders whether of a close corporation or whether of a corporation whose stock is publicly owned is always subordinate to the rights of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.909" offset="9003572">Throughout the decisions below, it would seem that the courts were more concerned with the protection of the stockholders than the protection of the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.995" offset="9063967">Now, any plan whether it's one of reorganization under a Chapter X or whether it's one of arrangement under Chapter XI, must we submit these in the best interest of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.893" offset="9131572">And the creditors in this case believe that their interest would be best served if these proceedings continue in Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.241" offset="9172950">And it shall be my burden to demonstrate that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.546" offset="9190087">Now, simply to hold that a large corporation whose stock is publicly owned may not avail itself of the privilege of obtaining an extension of payment or for that matter a composition of its debts does violence to the very intent and purpose of Chapter XI which concededly was to permit an adjustment of unsecured debts with a minimum of delay and a minimum of expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.250" offset="9344940">Otherwise, it would seem, if it may please the Court, would be tantamount to forcing such a corporation to a choice between an involved Chapter X proceeding or liquidation and straight bankruptcy, notwithstanding, that there may not be present either a need or a desire or a possibility of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.860" offset="9463432">Now, the effect of the decisions below, if I may suggest to Your Honors, would require a large listed corporation with stock publicly owned whose assets, and if I may paraphrase the standards suggested by Judge Frank below, whose assets are in excess of a million dollars, perfectly solvent, otherwise, and as to which there isn't the faintest suspicion of the conduct of management and which for example desired and required an extension of its bank obligations or which may desire or require, let us say, a composition or adjustment of damage claims which may have arisen out of an action on anticipatory breach of contract where the corporation concededly receive no benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.225" offset="9724865">And even though that that class of creditors, a majority, may have indicated a willingness to extend credit to such a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.378" offset="9773453">If the decision below stands, that corporation must go through the involved cumbersome expensive procedures of a Chapter X.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.571" offset="10486282">The -- there is a very substantial (Inaudible) in this case which is subjected to parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.958" offset="10519824">And that is the stock of the two subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.945" offset="10543752">There is an equity of $2,000,000 in those subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.571" offset="10562247">But there is still unpaid approximately $2,000,000 of the original purchase for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.679" offset="10590668">And that stock is held by a trustee and there is a record foreclosure of that security if we're going to a X.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.582" offset="10630269">I say there's a threatened foreclosure because the trustee has specifically waived the right to foreclose pending termination of these proceedings with the hope that we'd be able to work something else in arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.039" offset="10692127">Now, the Commission suggests that, well we shouldn't be bothered by that threat because the District Court has the power to restrain such a foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.370" offset="10737476">I agree that the District Court has such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.946" offset="10755762">But that power rests in discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.359" offset="10765375">And there's no warranty that the discretion would be exercised in favor of a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.428" offset="10813649">The Commission also suggests that the trade creditors could voluntarily in a Chapter X proceeding, agree to accept payment of their claims at a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.714" offset="10870805">I say that, that's not so because absent the consent of every single creditor in the Chapter X proceeding, notwithstanding, that the required two-thirds had consented to take less in the Chapter X proceeding under the doctrine of this Court in the case against Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.126" offset="10980415">Even though the two-thirds it so agreed, the plan would fall of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.933" offset="11007687">Now, we justly feel that we will be prejudiced by further delay and further dissipation of the assets in this case and I think that it may have been suggested by a question asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.719" offset="11062857">I think that had not these interim appeals, this litigation with respect to our right to have remained in Chapter XI intervened, the debtor, by now, would have had its plan of arrangement confirmed in the ordinary course of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.487" offset="11165884">I should like to -- to add one further point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.564" offset="11190230">If as Judge Frank suggests, in his concurring opinion that it's necessary to establish monetary standards to determine what is a large corporation and what is not a large corporation, it would seem to me that the Circuit Court is suggesting something which Congress, in the first instance, should have put in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.507" offset="11313946">And the very fact that Judge Frank saw it necessary to delineate what standards constitute a large corporation and what do not I think bares out the fallacy of the opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.088" offset="11388343">Best to force this doubt into a reorganization whereas Judge (Inaudible) points out, there's nothing to reorganize, can bring about only a liquidation of the debtor to the detriment of its creditors and to the complete elimination of its stockholders who bought for one representing, as Mr. Rosen point out, two-tenths of 1% of the entire capital stock of indicated no desire to reorganize this corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.378" offset="12389460">On our side of the case, that is on the respondent side, we both agree that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.633" offset="12422478">The Commission, on the grounds that I have just stated, the right representing Mr. Shlensky, supports us except that he would put it on the basis of the appropriate exercise of discretion by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.823" offset="12507220">Now, if I may first answer or try to answer Justice Black's question while it is still fresh in mind what to, have asked counsel, spoke to whether there are any stockholders or any stockholder interest as it has expressed itself either against the plan or in favor of the plan other than Mr. Shlensky, may I respectfully point out that under Chapter XI, by virtue of its very terms and in view of its basic function, stockholders have no opportunity to be heard, to be notified, and brought that may appear in the record, know nothing about these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.646" offset="12706482">It is true that Judge Clark in the majority opinion in the court below made this statement and I assume, let's say, finding was supported by the record that -- that the stockholder seemed to be generally opposed to this plan and were worried as to the ultimate outcome of their equity and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.715" offset="12874815">Now, to be perfectly frank with the Court, I know nothing in the record to support that other than Mr. Shlensky's petition in the position that he has taken in this Court, or has taken in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.140" offset="13024549">And if I'm not incorrect, the courts have held that once a stockholder like this brings such a suit know not tasked in the usual representative capacity form that he would not be permitted to discontinue with or withdraw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.839" offset="13103334">It could not be brought off on the theory that he does represent the stockholders as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.218" offset="13124859">So, I think Your Honor is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.223" offset="13140846">Now, the petitioner's argument to this Court, with respect to the Realty case, breaks down in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.396" offset="13189538">First, that it's not applicable because the facts differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.052" offset="13208137">Sure, it differs, we don't have two identical cases but the controlling principles are the same because of this fundamental fact that, I submit, we simply cannot get away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.887" offset="13259546">That is, that this debtor General Stores like U.S. Realty, has a substantial public investor interest which needs protection, cannot get it under Chapter XI but only under Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.870" offset="13339376">And therefore, the language of the statute, the adequate remedy that is required is available only under Chapter X and not under Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.199" offset="13384725">Have in mind here, we have 7000 public stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.655" offset="13406563">That happens to be the same number that we had in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.472" offset="13429864">The stock is actively traded on the American Stock Exchange which is, in and of itself, is an indicium of a substantial public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.145" offset="13476571">Furthermore, it is a company that has had a checkered financial history, using the words of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.875" offset="13515442">It had its ups and down and by virtue of the fact that it now has invoked the rehabilitation powers of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.167" offset="13560581">I would respectfully submit to the Court that that alone indicates that there has been a sufficient deterioration in its position, financial position to be of concern and deep concern to the public security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.758" offset="13634978">Now, the Court may very well inquire but we don't regard their regarded difference and observe a difference between the character of the public investor interest in the Realty case as distinguished from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.361" offset="13697358">I think that was implicit in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.119" offset="13724421">There is a difference in the character of that interest because in the Realty case, there were public debenture holders, public creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.510" offset="13762038">But that was not the controlling fact nor the decisive factor upon which this Court decided the Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.863" offset="13807386">This Court was most articulate in spelling out and we don't propose to re-plead or ask this Court even to reconsider those factors, which in the aggregate constitute this public investor interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.356" offset="14161398">That where you've got a large corporation, large public corporation, by that, I assume, you mean with a large number of public security holders that in 90 -- 95% of the cases, Chapter XI does not afford an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.375" offset="14229420">I -- we can conceive of cases where there might be a -- a large number of public security holders where the question would be a little closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.278" offset="14277068">For example, if all of the stock were underwater and there was no present equity in favor of the stockholders and you had only stockholders, you certainly would have to reexamine a little bit more carefully to see whether the substantial public investor interest there justified resort to Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.303" offset="14365153">I would submit that even there, it would be important to look at the financial history of the company and to determine whether the -- there was a fair prospect that the stockholders though, having no present equity, might as a result of the thorough reorganization possible under Chapter X, might very well come out with some interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="6810.609" offset="27242371">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.674" offset="27258671">With the -- with respect to certain questions which the Court had, may we point out that a description of the proceeding in Chapter XI is contained in at page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.851" offset="27323350">In that case we show how extremely wrong it is to make the statement that all the proceedings in Chapter XI are under the control of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.566" offset="27366191">As a matter of fact, once a debtor files his petition in Chapter XI, the proceeding moves under the control of the Court and the creditors as represented by the Creditors Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.327" offset="27421257">Now, we believe that is one of the most important distinctions from the way the case is being argued by the S.E.C.and by the stockholder Shlensky.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.340" offset="27469322">In other words, we, representing the debtor, are here between if you like to fire us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.938" offset="27495654">We have the creditors who, as we show in our brief, have real control over this Chapter XI proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.658" offset="27530553">And on the other side, we have the S.E.C.who, regardless of the interest of creditors as expressed by them, regardless of the fact that it can be so easily shown that stockholders get a worse deal in this type of case in Chapter X, nevertheless, move ahead and ask that we go into Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.435" offset="27613727">The stockholder Shlensky, petitioning in his own behalf, not joined by anybody else and there is nothing in the record that the stockholders are with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.287" offset="27657091">In fact the record shows just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.800" offset="27667122">The record shows that the things that Shlensky is unhappy about, the investments in the new enterprises were fully presented to the stockholders with proxy statements which were cleared by the S.E.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.735" offset="27734936">And then not a small block of management stock voted for it but the stockholders voted four-to-one and there are 7000 stockholders outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.872" offset="27783419">Now, this situation is, that when this motion was made below in the District Court, there were no facts shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.148" offset="27824588">As they said, they didn't even suggest wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.175" offset="27848620">All they said was, “You're in the wrong chapter because you're a large stockholder, because it's a large corporation with publicly held stock and you have -- you have invested in this new drugstore group and you're getting out of the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.751" offset="27930958">As if a matter of business judgment created for some reason or other, a right in the S.E.C.to transfer the management and control of this company from the management to a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.658" offset="27998563">Now, that's in effect what they're trying to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.623" offset="28014446">Now, with regard to -- and I only have time just for the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.079" offset="28036284">In regard to the U.S. Realty case, we want to point out that the majority opinion in that case did express itself in terms of large corporation publicly held, what not, to be in Chapter XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="7023.141" offset="28092500">But the Court by Mr. Justice Stone, did not point out the statute, the basis for such an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7032.852" offset="28131370">The Court then went on, and this is what we feel is the important thing about the U.S. Realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7039.118" offset="28156447">Then it went on and said at page 452 at 310 U.S., still more important are the differences in the remedies obtainable under the two chapters which result from differences in the nature of the two proceedings and in the securities which may be affected, affected by the two proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.799" offset="28251115">And then Mr. Justice Stone starts quoting the statute and what does he quote?</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.395" offset="28269505">366, "The standards for the confirmation of a plan and if you can't confirm a plan, Congress said, the Court has the power to dismiss."</text>
            <text syncTime="7079.350" offset="28317362">Now, Mr. Justice Roberts wrote the dissent in that case and expressed himself as unsatisfied with the proposition that a Court in bankruptcy has the equity power to withhold rights which Congress has given to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7094.814" offset="28379220">And we ask that that matter be seriously reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7098.648" offset="28394580">But we don't believe that this Court came to that conclusion in the U.S. Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7102.849" offset="28411298">It certainly wasn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.931" offset="28419657">And Mr. Justice Stone said in unmistakable language, what was the most important consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.088" offset="28444317">He said, what was the basis of his own decision.</text>
