            <label>Mr. Otto E. Koegel</label>
            <text syncTime="7.509" offset="29989">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.205" offset="48797">I have heard it said many times that hard cases make bad law, it might make bad law and I hasten therefore to make this as least hard as my powers will avail.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.183" offset="116715">There is more than a fake suggestion here that there has been callous indifference on the part of the appellee municipality toward the plight of the incompetent whose affairs are now in the hands of a committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.704" offset="190798">In New York, we say committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.016" offset="196023">If I mispronounced that word, it's because of my earlier education in Washington where they call it committee, I believe still.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.871" offset="235416">I would like to dispel emphatically any such notion and as quickly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.498" offset="261956">I'll take just a minute to plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.153" offset="280555">I'd like to discuss, sir, but very briefly the municipality and its geography.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.210" offset="304797">Somers is a township called "Towns of New York State," organized in 1788.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.428" offset="333636">It comprises approximately 26,000 acres and some points are eight miles distance -- distant from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.139" offset="368536">It is not a homogenous community.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.526" offset="382015">A considerable portion of its population is to be found in so-called Somer developments, housing families from New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.280" offset="421094">Generally, they are adjacent to lakes, privately owned by the property owners associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.789" offset="451082">One of several in the community is Lake Purdy, where the property of Nora Brainard, the incompetent here, is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.629" offset="486504">Another is Lake Shenorock, where Mr. King lives, five miles distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.585" offset="510328">I have a country home in Hamlet called Granite Springs, seven miles distant from Lake Purdy.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.281" offset="537078">Another community is Lake Lincolndale in the north-central portion of the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.317" offset="557244">South Somers is seven miles distant from Lake Purdy's and that is where Mr. Chambers lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.294" offset="585143">The town is bisected with lakes belonging to the water supply of New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.210" offset="612833">It takes more than the equivalent time per mile to get from place to place as it would say in Arizona or California.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.184" offset="660689">The town house or seat of government is two miles from Lake Purdy in a building known as the Elephant Hotel, built by Bailey of circus fame to commemorate an elephant he brought into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.328" offset="713247">None of the elected officials from the Town of Somers come from Lake Purdy.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.824" offset="735295">The first attorney for the town in this litigation, Mr. Stanley Anderson, has never lived in the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.130" offset="764447">At the time of his employment, he lived at Katonah in the Town of Bedford adjoining, which was the home and place where he died of -- the first Chief Justice of this great Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.003" offset="835918">Also living in Katonah in another township is Mr. Covey, the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.560" offset="858175">He is a lawyer too of this incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.346" offset="877296">As I have said there is no elected official, public official in the Somers Government from Lake Purdy.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.603" offset="902374">Now, this is not to suggest that Somers official then do not know people in Lake Purdy, they most certainly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.928" offset="927660">But everybody's -- everyone's business is not every other person's business in a far flung township as would be the case in a small more closely confined rural town.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.404" offset="977607">Appellant states at the outset in his brief that the facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.272" offset="1005087">He is more or less justified in that because we have not come to grips with it and I should much prefer to see this case decided on the applicable principles of law rather than upon a narrow factual issue which he says doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.855" offset="1087321">He says the facts are undisputed because no affidavits were submitted and no proof produced controverting statements made by the appellant, Mr. Covey, the Committee of Nora Brainard and the affidavit of the counselor Mr. King.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.463" offset="1177809">These were moving affidavits in support of an application for -- in order to show cause and a stay addressed to the County Court, County Court under the foreclosure in rem statute being the Court vested with jurisdiction over those foreclosures except in New York County where there is no County Court and in which case it is the Supreme Court of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.616" offset="1302361">I will demonstrate I hope that there was a completely improper procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.534" offset="1330051">The correct one being the filing of a plenary action to set aside the judgment of foreclosure together with the filing of a lis pendens which the statute specifically refers to and makes -- required in the county clerk's office, that was not done either.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.693" offset="1402671">Now, if I may take up very hurriedly these affidavits and I'll accept them at their face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.510" offset="1425972">We'll see how much value they have on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.076" offset="1444258">The King affidavit, from investigation made by me and from conversations have --</text>

            <label>Mr. Otto E. Koegel</label>
            <text syncTime="386.248" offset="1544986">-- of the transcript of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.058" offset="1580199">From investigation made by me and from conversations had -- had with the duly elected officials in the Town of Somers, not merely any of them or the purport or substance of the conversation, much less detailed and narrative, I am of the opinion that the said Nora Brainard was and has been incompetent for more than 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.601" offset="1670374">If that isn't conclusory, I -- I don't know what is.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.917" offset="1683644">I had been advised that more than two years ago efforts were made by one of the justices of the peace of the Town of Somers.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.845" offset="1715304">I'm not saying which one or what advice he got to have her committed to Grasslands Hospital, a state hospital for mental defectives, by reason of her mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.059" offset="1764206">I've been further advised that on many occasions, the state police were called to abate the nuisances committed by the said Nora Brainard.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.539" offset="1798060">It would have been helpful if some slight specification were had in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.327" offset="1829303">In the King affidavit, this is also recited that Mr. King is the attorney for Harry B. Brainard which he goes on to -- whom he goes on to describe also as the husband and sole surviving heir at law of the said Nora Brainard.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.943" offset="1911745">Now, the living could have an heir at law but that's what he says, the said Harry Brainard being a non-resident of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.211" offset="1940793">So, she was living alone by the very necessary implication -- conclusion of this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.419" offset="1973603">Now, the affidavit of Mr. Covey, the Committee on the subject of the competency of Nora Brainard and with respect to an answer to -- previous to her commitment says only the following, "Upon information and belief, the said Nora Brainard was incompetent, although not adjudged for many years passed and was known to the citizens of the Town of Somers in which she resided and to the officials of the town as a person without mental capacity to handle her affairs and unable to -- and understand the meaning of the notices served personally upon her by mail or by publication."</text>
            <text syncTime="535.694" offset="2142772">Now, even allowing face value, as I indicated I would to this -- as evident, I submitted, does not amount too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.499" offset="2177985">It is true that it was not denied in answering affidavit for the reason that no answering affidavit was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.693" offset="2210691">An oral return was made by the first counsel in this series that appeared here for the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.631" offset="2238485">I'm number three.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.285" offset="2249038">He made his conveyance, sir, and a country real estate lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.061" offset="2268160">He made an oral submission -- appearance to return on the return date in White Plains of this order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.374" offset="2313404">He submitted a brief memorandum of law after the manner in which I would consider a common law lawyer would say a demurrer ore tenus to the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.751" offset="3038981">I think the brief of the appellant stretches things a little too far, when on page 5 it suggests that the town attorney, that was Mr. Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.233" offset="3088927">He was the counsel for the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.494" offset="3093943">The town doesn't have an official called town attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.420" offset="3105646">The New York State law provides for one but that town has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.085" offset="3120274">As the counsel for the town especially engaged in this foreclosure work, they begin, Mr. -- the town attorney who applied for the order appointing Mr. Covey special guardian under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.861" offset="3179416">They say, "Why didn't he, since he was so mindful of that, suggest that he should do something with respect to one who he knew to be incompetent?"</text>
            <text syncTime="811.467" offset="3245767">Well, there's no real proof that he knew anyone to be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.643" offset="3266560">All he had before him was the -- were the two affidavits with the conclusory averments.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.035" offset="3308042">The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act provides that to the extent of any adverse effect upon anyone in the armed forces and that even goes into the -- carries into the foreclosure in rem statute of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.087" offset="3388291">A safeguard must be had and that is a special guardian must be appointed to inquire whether any armed forces personnel would be affected by any of these indicated names in the foreclosure proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.429" offset="3453701">Nora Brainard's name was one of the defendant's name, perforce the -- Mr. Covey, the same man later appointed Committee here, appointed their special guardian.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.942" offset="3503752">He came up with the obvious answer, the correct one that no soldier or sailor or marine had an interest affected and therefore he stipulated by order that there were no such -- the implications of that Act and the foreclosure was allowed to proceed on its way.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.813" offset="3599151">But they suggest from this legal factual record here that the town attorney, that's Mr. Anderson, that he was lax, having been so alert on that Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act not to have seen to it that this woman, obviously, incompetent should have had a Committee appointed for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.393" offset="3713567">I say that that is hardly fair to deduce such an obligation on him from the meagerness of this testimony but I -- I don't want this case to rest on that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.218" offset="3756826">The only reason I have advanced this is because it was suggested, I think, by Mr. Justice Burton that just what is the extent of the evidence here, from just what do they draw the conclusions that the town knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.789" offset="3827148">Because if the town did know that becomes certainly, in my book, immoral consideration that a proper government should take account of.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.282" offset="3873123">And I have not prepared on the basis of this record to conceive that this town did something that was patently immoral.</text>
