            <label>Mr. Frank E. Holman</label>
            <text syncTime="32.052" offset="128104">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.303" offset="157153">I appear here in behalf of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the appellant in Appeal Number 117, which is the first appeal in point of time while in this Court of this series of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.559" offset="254224">I'm sure the Court is already weary with its morning labors and looking forward to the recess which I understand is at 2 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.960" offset="311798">But I will begin and proceed as far as possible to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.917" offset="355579">I am also authorized to speak in behalf of the various intervenors who have filed briefs here on the Rio Grande site.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.192" offset="428722">One of those intervenors is represented by Mr. William J. Hickey and is the American Short Line Railroad Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.645" offset="486504">There are several intervenors represented by Mr. Lee J. Quasey.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.541" offset="522136">These intervenors represent a number of Live Stock Associations, Cattlemen's Associations, and only refers to our second page rather of his reply brief where is a list of these intervenors.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.258" offset="612937">I am also authorized to speak for the Public Service Commission of Utah and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Colorado, and a large number of other intervenors represented by Mr. John R. Barry.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.542" offset="714083">Perhaps, it should be said in passing to the Court that I was not one of counsel in any of the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.036" offset="756088">And hence, I have approached the issues in these appeals from a study and an examination of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.505" offset="797989">The appeals in Numbers 117, 118, and 119 are from a three-judge statutory District Court of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.236" offset="856921">The appeals in Numbers 332, 333, and 334 are from a judgment, one of a three-judge statutory federal court in the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.436" offset="917734">All of these appeals concern the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission of January 12, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.739" offset="974890">The appeals, as you know, have been consolidated for briefs, arguments, and disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.730" offset="1006864">The proceedings before the Commission were initiated by a complaint of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company against the Union Pacific and a large number of other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.745" offset="1074887">There were many intervenors on what may be termed as the side of the Rio Grande and what may be termed the side of the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.269" offset="1116996">But these intervenors spoke for themselves, as the record will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.631" offset="1146462">Now, if the Court please, before undertaking to argue any of the controverted issues, I would like the privilege of making a preliminary factual statement in an attempt to clarify the proceedings below and to outline the position that the parties take in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.061" offset="1240189">This factual statement, however, will be better understood if you will permit me to call your attention briefly to the statutes, which admittedly, control a determination of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.891" offset="1319497">As you are well aware of the Interstate Commerce Act, United States Code, Title 49 as a preamble, a declaration of National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.790" offset="1383131">And it recites, in general, that the Act is designed to promote safe, adequate, economical, efficient transportation among the several carriers and to encourage the establishment and the maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation service without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.365" offset="1505384">Now, a great deal will be said here today by all counsel with respect to section 15 (4) of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.796" offset="1551151">There is nothing complicated about this section, in my view.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.708" offset="1574766">In simple English, it is designed and we admit that, It is designed to protect the railroad, unless it consents to waive the privilege in what is called its long haul, which is the longest haul it can make over its own rails when participating in the movement of traffic on a through route over several connecting railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.896" offset="1695556">But this privilege of protecting its long haul is not in the nature of an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.397" offset="1729515">This would produce, if fixed (Inaudible) monopoly of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.303" offset="1749159">So, Congress wisely empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish new through routes whenever the Commission found it to be in the public interest, and found that the no through route is needed in order to provide adequate and more efficient or more economic transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.953" offset="1867755">When no through route exists, and one is to be established -- I have the red light --</text>
