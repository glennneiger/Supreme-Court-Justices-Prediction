            <label>Mr. F. T. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="5.484" offset="21838">Just before the recess, I was stating that the Commission itself recognized there's no area of concept and it's our determination of the just and reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.978" offset="71889">And I referred to a recent decision of the Commission which I mentioned on page 3 of our reply brief where the Commission refused to accept an examiner's holding that there was a zone of reasonableness of -- and the examiner had decided that a 6.1% return could be accepted on a filing because the Commission had previously held that a 6% return was reasonable for that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.418" offset="213577">The Commission said that the one-tenth of 1% return doesn't in itself measure the difference between a fair and unfair return, but it said that we must fix the return in accordance with our own best judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.423" offset="281600">Accordingly, the Commission reduced the file rate there from a 6.1% return to a 6% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.300" offset="317127">Contrast here, the zone of reasonableness that would have to exist if Sierra's position were correct comparing a 2.6% return with the 4.75% return compare the rate which is filed with -- by the PG&amp;E with the old contract rate which yielded only 78% of the revenue yielded by the new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.099" offset="432379">That is no -- certainly, a zone that we could hardly expect a court to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.070" offset="484206">Further examination of what the Commission does will show that the Commission doesn't engage in a two-step procedure, either under Section 205 (e) or under 206 (a) or the corresponding provisions of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.149" offset="556513">The Commission proceeds to determine on the basis of the available evidence from all of the figures and data, what it believes is the reasonable rate for the servicing question, and if the filed rate is different then the Commission orders the rate changed accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.942" offset="655673">And it follows that process under a -- 206 (a) proceeding just as clearly as it does under a -- 205 (e) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.313" offset="717218">The record in the Hope Natural Gas case will show that that is exactly what the Commission did there and that was a 5 (a) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.848" offset="755357">The provision of Section 206 (a) and the corresponding one of Section 5 (a) of the Gas Act, doesn't say that the Commission shall first find that the existing rate is unreasonable and then, if it does so, proceed to a determination of the reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.506" offset="838008">It says that whenever the Commission finds that the existing rate is unreasonable, then it shall determine the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.163" offset="872594">And the process which the Commission follows as I say is not a two-step procedure.If to proceeds that wants to decide for itself what is the reasonable rate and then proceeds accordingly to adjust the existing rate if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.653" offset="938527">And that is exactly what happens under the other proceedings or the utility files at proposed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.353" offset="973322">The Commission doesn't take the proposed rate and determine whether it is reasonable and if it finds it unreasonable then by a separate step decide what is the reasonable rate, it proceeds to determine what in its own mind is the reasonable rate, and fixes the rate accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.129" offset="1096516">It is apparent that the requirement of 206 (a) for a finding that the existing rate be reasonable is in essence a burden of proof or failure of proof requirement, if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.315" offset="1161195">It says in effect what shall happen if the -- if there is a failure of proof, then the Commission being unable to find the existing rate unreasonable or any other rate reasonable must lead the existing rate in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.903" offset="1235592">And similarly, under Section 205 (e), the burden of proof is expressly placed upon the utility to sustain an increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.328" offset="1273208">If it fails to sustain its burden of proof, the existing rate remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.160" offset="1300584">The -- if we are -- if this principle be accepted then that there is one just and reasonable rate to be established by the Commission in its own best judgment using its expert knowledge, its experience, and all of the material which is available to it in a form of regular filings by the utility and the general economic knowledge which it has on the industry then, we submit, there is no difficulty in interpreting the Federal Power Act as setting up two procedures for changes in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.825" offset="1471216">One, the Section 205 procedure is -- for a use by the utility where it proposes a change in the rate, contract rate or otherwise and 206 (a) is for the Commission or a complaining party to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.069" offset="1540180">Now, the procedural difference is that under Section 205, the utility must not only ask for a change, it must say, "We want to change -- we want this rate changed to a particular rate and must file that rate."</text>
            <text syncTime="403.028" offset="1612069">And it has a burden of proof of establishing that rate and that is quite reasonable in view of the utility's knowledge of its own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.155" offset="1644565">Under 206 (a), neither the Commission or a complaining party is obliged to propose a substitute rate of -- the filing --</text>

            <text syncTime="447.241" offset="1788865">The point is that the Act says that when the utility wants to change it, it must propose the substitute.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.298" offset="1861172">It's not necessary for the court below to read into the Act a special treatment for contracts which are treated in Court and the terms with other rates, because a reasonable contract rate it might be displaced by a higher reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.886" offset="1947481">The -- the fear of the court below was imaginary.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.537" offset="2090109">The difference in a fact of the two procedures pairs in the determination of what is to happen while the subject is being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.871" offset="2139429">And Section 205 (e) says that the utility can't have its change for five months if the Commission suspends.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.132" offset="2176522">And after that, it may collect the -- the increased rate, but it has to refund any portion that is not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.530" offset="2210064">So there isn't any possibility under Section 205 (e) of the utility collecting anything in excess of the rate which the Commission ultimately decides to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.895" offset="2263562">And that is exactly what happened in this case pending the litigation, the rate went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.173" offset="2288640">The Pacific Gas and Electric Company was ordered to account for the increase and be prepared to refund it with interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.866" offset="6819422">They can't legally increase that rate until you've looked at it and found out under 5 (a) whether the rate is reasonable and the contract rate is the only legal rate until that's done.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="1883.015" offset="7532042">Now, I would like to turn to the importance of contracts in the electric business as illustrated by the record in this case which I think will meet Mr. Justice Frankfurter's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.407" offset="7589616">In -- at page 28, 29 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.679" offset="7610619">I think it begins at page 27, I discussed and quote from testimony given before the California Commission by Mr. B. B. Beckett, the Chief Engineer of PG&amp;E, Mr. Searls' client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.280" offset="7673104">At that time, Pacific Gas and Electric Company was attempting to get the Federal Power Commission of the State -- California State Commission to authorize a regular schedule or a recognized schedule known as P-31 which was to be used only in connection with contracts for five years or more, which was to be used only for company's sales and wholesale for re-sale to distributing companies to meet -- to enable the distributing companies to meet competition, then threatening because of the Shasta Dam that was being built in the North of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.875" offset="7843422">Mr. Beckett began by pointing out ten years earlier in 1936, they had been before the Commission and got in a similar rate known as P-30, a lower rate to be used to poster the threat of companies and localities and municipalities building their own steam plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.530" offset="7914057">And he say's now, the steam plant danger is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.450" offset="7921789">It cost too much to build a steam plant but we've this threat to cheap Government power from Shasta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.198" offset="7944777">And he said when he was asked whether he's going to pay the full pay return?</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.997" offset="7963899">No, no, then that's not going to produce any full pay return if you mean by that the normal allocated rate of return that we use in rate measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.800" offset="7999112">But he said, "I know of my own knowledge that it's often better to keep business and to lose it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.464" offset="8021786">And if the incremental return, not allocated, exceeds the incremented cost so that we lose less by selling at this low rate than we would lose if we lost the business and abandon our investment in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.924" offset="8087615">That's that for the company, and this -- this contract is a P-31 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.897" offset="8115513">I'll come to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.074" offset="8124291">They said to him, should it always be for five years or at least five years or preferably longer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.571" offset="8154279">There is some talk here especially in the briefs and I think Mr. Searls suggested that it never was intended that this contract should be minding as to rates for each term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.153" offset="8184581">They asked Mr. Beckett, why does the costumer want to enter such a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.829" offset="8207256">So, that he will be assured of the low rate at least for the duration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.810" offset="8231184">Now there, you have from their own mouths an explanation of why it's important to set the company to enter into conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.226" offset="8260859">Now, they entered into some 20 or 25 P-31 contracts prior to the time they began abrogating them in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.911" offset="8295549">Our contract was entered into 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.886" offset="8311536">After about two or three years of negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.040" offset="8320104">After the war in 1946, we discovered that the existing distribution system over the mountains of being inadequate by 1952 or 1953, we needed a new line, and we badly needed lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.159" offset="8372558">The reason we needed lower rates, spread all over the record on every page of the record, was that the people of Nevada whom we served and their political leaders and everybody there said, "Why isn't Nevada never gotten its share of Colorado River Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.724" offset="8426893">Well, it was too hard to bring it over the deadline was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.213" offset="8436820">Why can't we get Shasta power instead?</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.130" offset="8448418">And so, in 1946, two years before the contract was entered into, we went to them and we said we need a new line and we need cheaper rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.970" offset="8483840">They made a study and they pointed out themselves their own engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.689" offset="9762691">It's all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.916" offset="9762586">They said they'd better -- we better think of giving them a lower rate because of this threat of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.282" offset="9762482">But they didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.217" offset="9762377">And they said no, we've given you 15-year contract at the same rates plus an escalator clause or even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.396" offset="9762273">That shows that this rate was meant to be binding when they wanted to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.224" offset="9762168">They put in an escalator clause and we said we won't have an escalator clause in this rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.777" offset="9762064">Well, for a year after that, that was in January 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.434" offset="9761959">For a year, we debated and discussed how can we get Shasta power, Government power of some kind or cheaper power somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.865" offset="9761855">It's all over the record every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.730" offset="9761750">Their own president advisory committee met and said, how soon are we going to get somewhere with Sierra?</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.066" offset="9761646">Oh, Sierra can't -- won't talk to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.742" offset="9761541">They are dealing with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.258" offset="9761437">And finally, in August of 1947, the Bureau of Reclamation wrote to Sierra and said how -- to PG&amp;E and said we've been approached by these Nevada people, how about your winning Shasta power into Nevada?</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.275" offset="9761332">Of course, they didn't like that a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.189" offset="9761228">So, they've got together and they said, guys we've got to do something about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.061" offset="9761123">How about offering them P-31 say's the president of PG&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.076" offset="9761019">And then, the vice president now president, Mr. Sutherland said, “Well we hadn't considered it while you thought of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.757" offset="9760914">We make a study of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.820" offset="9760810">He and Mr. Beckett make a study which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.490" offset="9760705">We found in the last minute of the hearing so that it's not very well presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.497" offset="9760601">There's no testimony about it that it was there all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.202" offset="9760496">The present President Mr. Sutherland and the Chief Rate Engineer made a study on the incremental cost versus the incremental return that they would get first by willing then by buying Shasta power under their own contract and not -- and then selling their power to us under P-31, they said why it's for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.131" offset="9760392">It's just about the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.371" offset="9760287">We make more money and we won't get into trouble by willing Government power will offer investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.653" offset="9760183">They also discussed the line over the mountains and said that was uneconomical all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.329" offset="9760078">It also appears in the record that even after the brief was entered into, Sierra said, can't we have this contract cancelable by us if we can still get Government power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.317" offset="9759974">Well, perhaps how the contract was entered into they've now contend and even the Commission contends there wasn't much competition to it, and just (Inaudible) this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.406" offset="9759869">They went before the Federal -- California Commission the next year for an increase and said, now of course we've got this 25 -- 22 contracts including Sierra, entered into to meet competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.461" offset="9759765">We don't want to increase those Mr. Searls' predecessor then General Counsel of PG&amp;E said,” Well, we've just entered into these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.216" offset="9759660">Anyone who would accuse us of double dot dealing repudiation if we should -- now, I ask for an increase, and I think anyone would and I think anyone now does as myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.725" offset="9759556">Well, at that time of course, they were still in that side of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.772" offset="9759451">But in 1953, they had entered into their own agreement with Shasta.The -- some question in the facts exactly as to whether they did it or whether the bureau did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.628" offset="9759347">They entered into a wheeling agreement with the Bureau whereby they would wheel all the power of the bureau wanted to wheel within an area which excluded Sierra.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.717" offset="9759242">And then, they've entered into another agreement whereby they had wheel 290,000 kilowatts for Shasta power into the City of Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.700" offset="9759138">So, that the Sacramento Municipal District, there was no longer any Shasta power we could get even if we could bring it over the mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.846" offset="9759033">What did they do then?</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.552" offset="9758929">They proceeded as to increase all their rates except the City of Redding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.387" offset="9758824">They said Redding is right at the Shasta Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.617" offset="9758720">They still got a competitive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.081" offset="9758616">We don't want to touch their rate, but that's increased all of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.046" offset="9758511">California Commission said, “No you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.270" offset="9758407">We know how you entered into these contracts and you came here and asked us for the right to make this little rate contracts for periods of years to meet competition, and you've got to live up to them and unless you can get renegotiations."</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.873" offset="9758302">I should bring out because there's much about it in the -- in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.423" offset="9758198">After the contract was entered into, we -- it had to be approved by the California Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.836" offset="9758093">At the hearings before the California Commission, all the Nevada people came storming into the hearing room and said we don't like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.727" offset="9757989">We still want Shasta power, and the president of Sierra and his engineer tried to back up the contract and they said why it would take him too long to build the line over the mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.388" offset="9757884">We couldn't meet our peak in 53 and 54 if we use Shasta power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.591" offset="9757780">Although the rate would be cheaper, the rate quoted by the Government would be cheaper than the rate under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.650" offset="9757675">It's more practical to accept this contract because they couldn't deliver in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.452" offset="9757571">The Commission claims that shows we couldn't ever have dealt with Shasta at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.090" offset="9757466">Well, of course you can forego a peak for a winter by not taking on more loads, if you can get much cheaper power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.212" offset="9757362">That's what the engineer stated at the time in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.024" offset="9757257">So that's why this contract -- (Inaudible) interrupt me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.984" offset="9757153">That's why this contract was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.680" offset="9757048">It stands all over the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.257" offset="9756944">The only thing I'm surprised at is why an attempt was made to prove it isn't so or why anybody contends it isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.561" offset="9756839">I was glad that Mr. Fletcher conceded of course that they entered into their contracts in good faith and telling them to be binding and insert the evidence that these were intended and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.300" offset="9756735">However, and they so swore repeatedly before the State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.425" offset="9765616">They said this was done to meet competition and that's why we did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.190" offset="9784738">Now, they say, oh nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.351" offset="9789336">it's all nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.143" offset="9792470">We want to get out of it and they raised all these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.604" offset="9802397">Now, at the hearing, as I say, we maintained the because of these reasons, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.113" offset="9848372">The Federal Commission followed California Commission but didn't go into the legal question so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.144" offset="9864568">They just said we're going to make to lift the contract with -- two Commissioners did that and that's after we lost our attempt to have them reject the file on the matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.318" offset="9905215">The Commission beat us on the matter of law right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.464" offset="9913783">They said no we don't pay any attention to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.822" offset="9923187">But you may raise your contentions at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.145" offset="9936562">So, we went into the hearing and the hope as I say persuading to them but under the state of facts, they -- they did not accept the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.632" offset="9962475">But, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.635" offset="9966446">Three commissioners said that we have the facts wrong or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.673" offset="9982642">The other two stood by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.147" offset="9988493">They also said because the contract didn't mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.098" offset="10000300">And then they said as much as made to this by Mr. Searls and his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.276" offset="10025064">We may point out that if a finding on the lawfulness of the 1948 contract rate were necessary, or appropriate on the record before us, that finding would have to be that the 1948 rate is unreasonably low and therefore unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.611" offset="10094341">They went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.445" offset="10101760">None of the evidence in this record warrants a finding that any rate would be reasonable, that would produce a return substantially less than the 4.75% resulting from the proposed rate which is the minimum, PG&amp;E is willing to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.940" offset="10167693">Well, it so says that that's a finding and of course it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.438" offset="10185665">They said if it were necessary, it would make a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.034" offset="10196114">That's not the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.651" offset="10202593">They said the finding was not necessary as to the reasonableness of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.215" offset="10224849">If the finding were necessary, the finding may propose to make there, would have to be set aside by the courts because it's perfectly well established that a contract can't be set aside just because it's more burdensome on one party than another, or because it is harmful to the company's stockholders, it must be harmful to the company itself or to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.618" offset="10318472">It must either be discriminatory or preferential or exorbitantly high or the burden must be thrown on other consumers or it must injure the company from performing its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.348" offset="10381375">Well, and Mr. Wahrenbrock in the -- before the Commission conceded that they none of those things, he says well if first he was here -- he was defending the 4.75 rate before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.717" offset="10442815">Well, if PG&amp;E is willing to serve one costumer less than to pay return on that business, and earn only a fair return on all the other costumers which is the situation here because the stockholders have solved the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.889" offset="10495478">It seems to me that the other costumers are not the victims of an undue discrimination because they are getting all that the law entitles into in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.568" offset="10530168">They're paying only a reasonable return on the business to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.575" offset="10542289">Isn't that the situation here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.874" offset="10551484">Mr. Wahrenbrock, after a little more exchange, yes, that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.316" offset="10561202">Of course it is the situation under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.462" offset="10569770">It's been the situation right or wrong under the contract and made it conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.944" offset="10587742">I forgot to point out that when the California Commission approved the P-31 schedule and again when it expressly approved this contract, it made the condition, asked PG&amp;E to agree to the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.174" offset="10644689">The PG&amp;E of course had to agree that in fixing its rates to its other costumers, the other costumers will not be made to bear any higher rate because of the lower rate with which they were serving Sierra that the loss of this business would fall solely on the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.742" offset="10714906">And that of course was agreed to, the management did it for the benefit of the stockholders because they thought it was better to keep this business at the lower rate than to lose several million dollars of investment to building lines over the Sierra Summit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.930" offset="10767673">That was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.048" offset="10772167">It said it over and over that that was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.969" offset="10779794">He swore to it under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.711" offset="10786795">He tried to deny it in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.376" offset="10801424">Again, Mr. Wahrenbrock said in his brief, the only question would seem to be whether in determining what is a fair return for this business?</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.416" offset="10845623">PG&amp;E should be held bound by the representations and agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.799" offset="10859102">It made in 1948 as to a satisfactory return for the term of its agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.899" offset="10879582">In other words, should they be bound by this contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.307" offset="10889195">Under the rate regulation practices heretofore followed by the California Commission, Mr. Wahrenbrock's position and by this Commission, no costumer -- no other costumer of PG&amp;E will bear any greater burden, if PG&amp;E is held to its 1948 representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.696" offset="10954710">And the California Commission has held that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.063" offset="10968189">He points out that California Commission also refused to let them increase their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.138" offset="10992536">But he then goes on and says the fact that only a very small percentage of PG&amp;E's business is involved in this contract, and therefore, it doesn't hurt PG&amp;E's -- I'm reading footnote on page 45 of my brief now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.040" offset="11056065">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.393" offset="11061499">I'll tell you where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.165" offset="11072575">He says that the fact that in this instance, no harm is done to anybody because it's a small part of the company's business, still affects the question of principle that if PG&amp;E entered into a great many contracts, it might hurt itself economically and that would be bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.668" offset="11142583">Well, I agree of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.975" offset="11147807">As soon as that happens, the Commission will come in and set aside the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.010" offset="11164003">But here, it's on the record and this case was so advocated by everybody that nobody but the stockholders of PG&amp;E are hurt when (Inaudible) by our contract even though the contract produces only 2.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.087" offset="11216248">The Commission was correct when it accepted the 4.75 rate proposed by the company absent of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.702" offset="11270792">Assuming there was no contract, for the avowed reason that that was the lowest rate that company was willing to serve at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.261" offset="11309035">I think it's the duty of the Commission to obtain the lowest available rate for it's -- for the costumers in the business provided the rate is not so low, as to hurt anyone or a discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.690" offset="11358668">The difference is, the Commission forgot when it said the 4.75 was the lowest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.423" offset="11381656">PG&amp;E was willing to service that, but in 1948, they'd agreed to service at the lower rate for 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.248" offset="11412898">Because they all say that was in the contract, who cares about a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.912" offset="11423556">They don't exist anymore but I think they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.538" offset="11434109">I think this Court knows they do and I think Congress knows they do and this Court has repeatedly so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.316" offset="11457202">So, that I believe that I'm convinced that if this had been a hearing under 206 instead of under 205, the Commission would have had to find out contract rate reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.904" offset="11519582">The Commission isn't there as the guardian of the stockholders of utility companies, if the management makes the contract for a good business reason to hold a business against competition then later, the competition is removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.972" offset="11575798">It isn't up to the Commission to say now, you can get out of your contract unless somebody is being hurt by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.343" offset="11601293">The management is the guardian of the contract, of its stockholders and the Commission is looking after the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.844" offset="11627311">And the only public is going to suffer here are the consumers in the State of Nevada whose rates will be -- have to be increased if this continues, and there is no refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.170" offset="11708604">They would have found it was too low and therefore unreasonable and went on and said that the 4.75 rate was the lowest rate the company was willing to serve at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.884" offset="11755520">Now, I'm assuming by that that the Commission correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.479" offset="11769835">It was taking to position which I think is the right position that a company's responsive rate, a company proposed rate will be accepted by the Commission even though it produces less than a full return if it is done for a reasonable purpose and doesn't hurt anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.083" offset="11848307">If it's done to meet competition or for whatever reason the management may think a good one to meet what they think is competition, I think their argument is that -- we couldn't have gotten Shasta anyhow, but anyway, PG&amp;E thought we could, they wanted to keep us out and they did keep Shasta out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.382" offset="11917479">There is no reason why the Commission should increase such a rate unless it is found that the public interest is hurt by the low rate contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.053" offset="11956140">And therefore, if the Commission is told that the contract is binding unless the contract is found against the public interest, then of course it is evident that PG&amp;E has agreed to serve the contract rate from the duration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.665" offset="12046629">That becomes the lowest rate at which they are willing to serve, and I think on the record in this case and in the like of many cases that have been decided by the courts, that rate would have to be -- will have to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.074" offset="12120294">Now, on this question of a rate being low, I should like to read briefly to Your Honors a decision of -- from an opinion in this Court, in a case involving this very problem whether a contract had to be increased because the rate was too low -- where is that Arkansas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.198" offset="12208692">I lost my note on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.250" offset="12216947">All right now, here's the Arkansas case, I had its map here because my map has moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.072" offset="12244219">I'll find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.205" offset="12248816">It's in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.387" offset="12253518">There, the question was the company said that the Commission, the State Commission I think it was, must reduce a rate because it falls too heavily on the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.475" offset="12317884">And this Court said -- it is at page 41 of my brief -- there was a contract that forbade on (Inaudible) forbade contracts from being upset in Arkansas so the Court said of course that settles it but says the Court, the question whether in the -- this Court in this case 261 U.S., the question whether in the absence of statute it'd be made to appear that the stipulated consideration was grossly inadequate, the Commission under the circumstances disclosed by the record would have been under a duty to fix state rates in contravention of the contracts may be put aside with great consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.191" offset="12480679">While the State may exercise its legislative power to regulate public utility -- utilities and fixed rates, not withstanding the affect may be to modify or abrogate private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.277" offset="12529058">There is quite clearly no principle which imposes an obligation to do so, merely to relieve a contracting party from the burdens of an improvident undertaking, the power to fix rates when exerted is for the public welfare to which private contracts must yield, but it is not an independent legislative function to vary or set aside to its contracts, however, unwise and unprofitable they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.452" offset="12625711">Indeed, the exertion of legislative power surely to that -- solely to that in is precluded by the contract in (Inaudible) clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.571" offset="12654237">The power does not exist per se, it is the intervention of the public interest which justifies (Inaudible) Mr. Wahrenbrock's reference to state decisions and I think he has 10 States on his side and my brief, I bring out I think we have 10 on ours and don't think he's earned the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.707" offset="12730828">I won't go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.982" offset="12735843">The state cases are usually on slightly different contract -- types of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.363" offset="12757368">There are many State cases that stand exactly for the proposition that we advanced here, some don't, but I would just like to read from a recent decision of the State Commission of the State of Indiana which has just come to my attention in the -- the most recent State decision on this matter in the Commerce Clearing House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.923" offset="12843677">It's a matter of Northern Indiana Public Service Company, there, the United States Steel Company brought what would be a 5 (a) proceeding under our Act to have a statute -- a contract set aside because the rate was too high, it was bind from the electric light company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.767" offset="12915043">It was a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.033" offset="12920059">And it entered into a 15-year contract with a local electric company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.611" offset="12934374">It said it's too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.330" offset="12941270">And we'd like to set aside in the State Commission, although State Commission's pay no attention to contracts, said, such a contract is subject to the police power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.353" offset="12985365">The power of interference of contracts is however an extra ordinary power and should not, and should therefore be sparingly exercised and only on the clear and unmistakable ground that the welfare of the general public demands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.761" offset="13043043">In our opinion, the fact that the terms of the contract there are heavily on one party or the other is not at of itself, sufficient to one of this interference unless it can be shown that the general public welfare is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.100" offset="13100304">The contract between competent and independent parties should not be interfered with by regulatory party except for adequate and compelling reasons of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.808" offset="13139174">Several State Commissions have expressed these views in clear and concise language starting particularly in a decision from the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.313" offset="13177208">So I had Connecticut and Indiana to my list of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.641" offset="13194553">I don't think this is a baseball game and we're going to win by 10 to 8 on the State cases however.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.170" offset="13212630">It is true that States, I think, mostly go along with the view that I have advanced but three or four of them have taken precisely the opposite view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.843" offset="13247321">Mr. Wahrenbrock bears with great confidence in the Midland Realty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.694" offset="13290684">I think the Midland Realty case when you read what this Court said and what the state court said is clearly distinguishable, this Court stated that it was bound -- these questions, I'm reading from page 45 of my brief, are to be decided upon the construction that the State Supreme Court put up on the statute, and that law is to be taken as if it declared that rates made in accordance with its provisions shall supersede all existing contract rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.079" offset="13416281">Now that's a little blind until you go and look at the state court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.185" offset="13436656">You there find in the two state court decision cited by this Court, and the Supreme Court of Missouri held first in the (Inaudible) case that because of our own peculiar constitutional provision, all existing rate contracts are outlawed here since the passage of the regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.163" offset="13512620">The point was the Commission -- the Constitution of Missouri was amended, I think way back in 1873, by adding a provision that the police power may never be bridge, and the Supreme Court of Missouri thought that that gave a police power greater sanctity than it has anyhow, and that when a regulatory statute was passed, any contract would violate the police power, and that that is why they so held is apparent because a month after the -- they decided that (Inaudible) case, they decided the (Inaudible) case at which they overruled some of their prior decisions which had held contracts were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.023" offset="13672072">It refused to overrule one which had so held before the amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.331" offset="13693283">Mr. Wahrenbrock says that that's all nonsense, what the police power got two with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.818" offset="13707180">Well, I'm not here to criticize the Supreme Court of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.371" offset="13721391">That's what they said was the reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.211" offset="13732780">And the only reason for it and because of it, they said that there can't be any contracts in the utility business in State of Missouri and that's all this Court upheld in the Midland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.471" offset="13773845">They said of course if the State says, so that's it, and there's no doubt about it, we -- this Court so held in the railroad business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.262" offset="14132976">I made a motion to the court asking to change that, because I said, according to the Commission's opinion here, all they'll do -- they'll say, we now say that the contract is bad and it's always been bad and validate the rate nunc pro tunc as the date of the illegal filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.779" offset="14211030">And I say this as you agree with us, the filing was illegal, the contract has been the illegal rate until it set aside and the Commission cannot act retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.289" offset="14261081">It must first find the contract unreasonable and then set it aside as to the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="3703.295" offset="14813100">In the other one I think, it's about $150,000 or $200,000 in the Mobile case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3725.816" offset="14903171">I don't think that's how this case is going to be decided, but Mr. Justice Frankfurter had asked also about the practice that the Commission and the cases effects somewhat on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.173" offset="14948624">As I've said, there are many State Commissions and many State cases that show they have followed in general the practice that we advocate, and the Commission to my knowledge in anything that's been presented here has never once permitted a contract rate to be increased over the objection of the other party under a proceeding of this kind until the two cases now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.734" offset="15046844">And there is a suggestion that's been made to the contrary has been disapproved, and I don't think they are even making them anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.586" offset="15070250">They did it one time and say they did it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.763" offset="15082998">I think in the other case I showed you that the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit are disposed of their argument regarding the Panhandle litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.513" offset="15114031">The fact that the Commission itself recognizes great contracts as valid and that -- also United Gas recognizes contracts as continuing to be valid despite all the storm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3807.825" offset="15231269">Mr. Wahrenbrock says no, the Act recognizes contracts but the company can change them anytime they like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.377" offset="15253420">Mr. Searls, as I understand it says, there can be only one rate, and that's the Commission rate and I think from there, reargues therefore there can't be a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.300" offset="15289156">How do I say, there are two rates writing its own case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3876.615" offset="15506390">Well that question, well suggested, we all agreed among each other that we didn't think it made it moot because I've got $140,000 I want to get back or more from my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.523" offset="15562083">So, if it doesn't really make it moot but there was -- we also stipulated that it would have no effect on this when they -- they offered it to all their costumers and of course we were losing an awful lot of money and we didn't know how long this case would go on, so that my client wanted to stop the loss of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.261" offset="15616940">Oh, Mr. Fletcher said why didn't we go and ask for increase rates in Alabama?</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.627" offset="15634495">And he says that something about who you're making too much money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.001" offset="15647974">Well Mr. -- the defendant (Inaudible) company who was here then and alleged, asked me to point out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.265" offset="15677022">He's the one who advised the person of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.560" offset="15686217">He said he didn't want him to go before the Alabama Committee because -- Commission because he believed his contract for resale of that gas was a valid and binding contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.371" offset="15729476">That's what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.846" offset="15735327">But here is the case, decided last month, United Gas Pipe Line Company v. Federal Power Commission, 220 F.2d 206, it's referred to in a footnote on my Sierra brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.712" offset="15794782">I didn't know of it when I wrote to Mobile brief, in which United Gas Pipe Line got into a controversy with Mississippi River Fuel Corporation is only frequently as in litigation, over the proper rate that it had a right to charge Mississippi under its existing rate contract, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.182" offset="15900630">The rate was a very complicated one, it depended of the source of power, and there was to be an adjustment and a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.262" offset="15933022">And Mississippi went to the Commission or to the Court, I guess, I don't know if it went to Commission and said -- they went before the Commission first at one time and said that they had not received the proper refunds and they'd been over charged.Mr. Fletcher didn't file or didn't say well, what's a recontract?</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.095" offset="16012330">He went before the Commission and then before the Court and said, “This contract, as I interpret it, entitles me to the higher rate I was collecting in accordance with the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.527" offset="16050051">The Commission said, “No, the contract provides the lower rate and we order you to carry out your contract and refund $2 million to Mississippi River Fuel Company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.388" offset="16093518">And it falls to contract, the rate contract, the fuels (Inaudible) went up to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals said the only question involved here of course is a construction of the contracts, the contract provides as the court below said and we enforced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.552" offset="16154122">And this Court, oh yes, I know how it brought to my attention now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.775" offset="16167079">This Court a month ago, or few weeks ago denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.613" offset="16182439">And when I saw that, I was interested in what it said about the facts and looked up the case and I quite naturally -- they shouldn't have taken certiorari in such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.226" offset="16216816">It's just a question of construction of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.117" offset="16224444">But my point is that everybody concerned recognized a valid contract to sell in either a -- either 30 cents or 20 cents whatever it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.770" offset="16263001">And they went also to Court to find and figure which rate was right and here they come in and say, all contracts don't count at all in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.914" offset="16291631">Now, I think by the time Your Honors are through looking at the discussion of the cases in the briefs, you will see that there isn't the slightest doubt, that contracts are and must be recognized in this business, and of course if they can be abrogated by any such method as that advocated here, they might as well say there are no contract because they don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.237" offset="16392882">I believe Mr. Justice Black asked Mr. Wahrenbrock how the Commission would proceed if my view were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.567" offset="16426214">I wasn't quite clear as to what his answer was but it seems to me very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.398" offset="16445544">The Commission can amend its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.319" offset="16453172">All these contracts were on file in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.537" offset="16462054">And one thing they can do is to have a clerk go up and see when somebody files an increase whether the rate being increased is embodied in the contract, but that's to come as soon they can say state in every increase whether any part of this rate is involved in the contract and if so who the other party is, and then they notify the other party and the party said we didn't agree to this or we did agree to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.983" offset="16551915">If they agreed to it, it goes ahead like any other rate increase (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.563" offset="16570201">If it didn't agree to what the Commission must reject it and then say, if he wants to, we want to look at this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.068" offset="16604264">And one other point that's been discussed here that I forgotten to raise now is to -- the company can't ask the Commission to review its own contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.548" offset="16646165">It definitely cannot under the Gas Act, because the Gas Act lists the parties that may bring a proceeding under Section 5 (a), under the Power Act, it merely says on complaint, Mr. Wahrenbrock says he construes that to mean that the company couldn't complain about its own rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.984" offset="16711889">I don't know whether it could or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.944" offset="16727771">But this power of Government to abrogate contract isn't made for the benefit of the parties of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.192" offset="16756715">It doesn't exist to enable people to get out of the contract that hurts them.It exists for the public welfare and the public welfare alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.845" offset="16787331">And Congress recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.938" offset="16795690">They said the representatives of the public who may be injured by the contract, they're the ones who may complain under 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.759" offset="16826932">A local distributing company on behalf of its costumers, a State Commission looking after all the people in the State if there is a discrimination, if there's an undue preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.176" offset="16872699">If the rate is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.744" offset="16878968">If the service is inadequate because the company is too poor, if the company isn't able to deliver service, all those are going to be taken cared of by the representatives of the consumer, and of course it's the State Commission, and other representative of the consumers and to local distributing companies, and they have power to initiate a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.872" offset="16959425">Nobody can stop Mr. Searls' client from writing a letter to the Federal Power Commission in saying we're being (Inaudible) by this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.567" offset="16990250">It involves one percent of our business and we are not able to perform our services unless you increase it please, you initiate a procedure, we can't -- they can't compel them, but they can ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.312" offset="17033195">So there's nothing that says that the company is tiny in getting out of a contract when it's against the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.155" offset="17064542">It's merely as time we confided in this contract when the -- when it's gotten all the benefits of it because the reason it entered into it no longer exist and doesn't want to have to pay the price for the benefit, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.854" offset="17111353">They've got the benefit here when we gave up all the chance to deal or keep power for somewhere else, and now we can't get it from somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.159" offset="17136536">They don't want to pay the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.667" offset="17142596">That's all there is to this case as similar in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.208" offset="17156807">I think simply, the principle of law in statutory construction require that will say that such contract be valid until the administrative party and the Federal Power Commission has found the public --</text>
