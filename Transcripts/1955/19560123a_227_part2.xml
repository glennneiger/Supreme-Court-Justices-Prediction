            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="3.614" offset="14420">In order to get the full force in effect of the Arkansas decision, it seems to me if we should consider for a few moments the National Labor Relation Act and how it has been construed by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.116" offset="104385">That Act regardless of how men may differ as to its economic philosophy was unquestionly -- unquestionably a long considered bit of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.684" offset="178678">To my mind it is precision legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.429" offset="201665">It seems to me that Congress knew exactly what they wanted to do and carefully proceeded to do it or to try to do it and its important to note that the Congress at no place put in a requirement that a union must comply or file the documents specified in 9 (f), (g) and (h) in order to have the right of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.200" offset="356728">There is as I see it no legal compulsion on a labor union to file those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.030" offset="420049">They had an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.128" offset="432483">It seems to me that the draftsman on the part of the Senate, the sponsor on the part of the Senate who had mathematics for recreation followed the example of some of the great mathematicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.540" offset="506149">When you have a great deal of trouble proving something approaching it from one direction start over again and approach it from the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.428" offset="553691">And the Labor Management Relations Act is not a law drawn on compulsions, it did make it unlawful from the failure to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.090" offset="620356">It didn't deprive him of any right of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.747" offset="638955">Instead of making it compulsory the statute is framed on an inducement basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.942" offset="683677">A man isn't compelled to file a non-communist affidavit, a labor union is not compelled to file its financial reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.811" offset="739161">The perversions in the law are that if he does not, if they are not filed no investigation will be made by the Board and they will not process a complaint made by a union that didn't file those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.059" offset="844173">No forfeiture of any basic protected right under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.718" offset="874789">It's merely a denial of processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.222" offset="892865">The -- you might call it as some of the cases have done a series of benefits and determents.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.300" offset="925153">But it seems to me that the men framing it avoided constitutional questions by treating everybody alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.642" offset="966531">Anybody that wants to come in and get the benefit of the processes of the Board can get him by filing those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.761" offset="1011043">If he doesn't file the papers, if the union doesn't file them there's no penalty, there's no fine, there is forfeiture in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.494" offset="1057959">The -- as a matter of fact the way the Act is worded, you can look at it from the opposite direction that 9 (f), (g) and (h) are limitations on the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.744" offset="1134968">They set up this machinery, the Congress sets it up and says you can do certain things but here are two things that you can't do under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.365" offset="1201424">So when Congress fail to take make certification a condition precedent, I say that that was not accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.521" offset="1246041">I think every phrase in that law requires careful study.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.475" offset="1273835">Now what Louisiana did, it comes along by this opinion, this ad hoc decision and adds a requirement to the right of representation which the federal law does not impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.769" offset="1358994">Louisiana says since you cannot be certified, you cannot exercise your right protected by 13 of the Act to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.181" offset="1420643">Since you can't be certified and I am not recognized you can't compel anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.357" offset="1445407">Now if they can come along and add by judicial decision a requirement of certification prior to representation, then the Supreme Court of Louisiana has amended the act of Congress in a basic point, on a basic theme and we see that under the decisions of this Court, the Garner case and the Weber case, said, we have a clearcut declaration of federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.522" offset="1610083">The Federal Government has declared certain things to be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.808" offset="1643207">If it's an unfair labor practice a state cannot either by decision or by statute invade upon the province outlined and delineated by Congress for this great administrative board.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.867" offset="1719380">To us it seems as if Congress having entered the field and having said we proscribe certain types of strikes that as indicated in a paragraph in the Garner case and referred to again in the Weber case that Congress having entered this field and having proscribed certain types of strikes would seem to imply that other kinds of strikes are permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.088" offset="1872248">Well now if we are going to have a complicated mechanism of solving the infinite number of problems that will arise in American Labor Relations, a machinery carefully set up by the Congress and then one state can come in and say we will put a requirement of certification in and another state would come in and say as they did down there, peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.976" offset="2007876">No matter what kind of picketing it was peaceful picketing for the purpose of getting recognition from the employer is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.871" offset="2055419">Well if it's protected by the Federal Act it's protected against state intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.347" offset="2093349">The -- the question of peaceful picketing, the cases of Hanker and Gazzam, those cases were not as I read cases involving a right protected by the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.021" offset="2184046">The -- they discussed picketing and differentiated picketing from being the exact equivalent of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.895" offset="2235559">But if the picketing is in a perfectly peaceful manner and if its for a lawful object then it is protected by the Labor Management Relations Act and being protected the state can't prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.324" offset="2325211">As they argue in the -- this Court asked the Solicitor General to file a brief and it does matter according to the opinion of the Solicitor General as written in their brief of whether or not they had certification if they are exercising a protected right, if it's into the field which has been preempted by Congress, then they say that even picketing by a minority would be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.355" offset="2493336">In answer to your question Mr. Justice Burton about the majority, there was never in a question of fact on whether or not the union had a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.381" offset="2541505">They -- they didn't refuse to deal with him because they had no majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.398" offset="2561567">They weren't even willing to find out if they had a majority.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="643.189" stopTime="660.791">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="643.189" offset="2572748">Well, the point that I had in mind particularly here is a suit being brought in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.147" offset="2592496">Now, if one of the allegations is that there is picketing where there was only a minority, that seemed to be a matter that would be within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, therefore the Louisiana case would be out.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="660.791" stopTime="660.922">
            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>

            <text syncTime="660.922" offset="2643592">Now -- and you're arguing that even though they had a majority it's also within the National Labor Relation Board and they're out again.</text>

          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="667.561" stopTime="668.413">

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="668.413" offset="2673580">But I would think they'd clearly be out in the first instance where they are picketing for a -- for a minority because that's squarely comes under the National Labor Relations Board, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="676.951" stopTime="691.664">
            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="676.951" offset="2707749">That would be bringing employer coercion on the -- through a labor union to influence these other employees to join the union.And that would be covered and they charge in paragraph 10.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>

            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="693.345" offset="2773368">They charge what amounts to an unfair labor practice and Mr. McCain in framing his defenses from the very beginning, the first thing he did in his exception ratione materiae -- ratione materiae was to say that this was covered, his exceptions to the jurisdiction, it was an exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.299" offset="2889143">Then when he came to his return to the rule in his answer he added the additional averment that it was not only in the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act but he also added to the averment that it was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.635" offset="2974511">And so far as we've been able to find, no case has presented this question as clearly and succinctly as the facts of this case presented to this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.374" offset="3277427">They can't -- they can't get -- a state court is not the proper court to try questions of unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.513" offset="3317969">This complicated mechanism with a general counsel responsible for filing the complaints with the Board separated from the trial examiners, with the Board made more judicial body, that is a complete system for the solution of labor problems by men who are presumably expert and they certainly have jurisdiction and if -- whether a union is in compliance or not they can order them to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and if they don't they can go before the court under the procedures prescribed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.954" offset="3491736">So we see that Louisiana has trespassed upon the law, it's added an amendment to an act of Congress and it has deprived the Labor Board of jurisdiction and so far as the record showed they never made any effort to see the Labor Board about anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.204" offset="4148767">I am going to have to be more specific in the discussion of the sections of the Labor Relations or the Labor Management Relations Act and Mr. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.935" offset="4207700">The union in this case is District 50 of the United Mine Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.212" offset="4228807">This is a union which has deliberately and as a matter of policy refused to comply with Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h) of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.709" offset="4282828">It was not admittedly inadvertently or temporarily out of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.532" offset="4306024">That is a studied union policy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.901" offset="4323579">Now, if Your Honors please, that's the gravamen of this case in the light of the interpretation of the effective -- the action of this union under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.289" offset="4369136">Now, here is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.770" offset="4387004">A representative of the union called upon the employer and says we want representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.419" offset="4413649">We want to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.928" offset="4423680">The Company was familiar with the fact that this District 50 was a non-complying union that it had failed to comply with the sections of the Act which require the execution of the non-communist oath and the filing of the financial data giving the disclosure to the proper authorities of the -- disclose your financial information dues and things of that type to union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.750" offset="4530991">Now, the employer in this case stated that the Board does not recognize you and for that reason we will not deal with you and we will not bargain with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.226" offset="4596820">Now, the employer here feels that if it had agreed to bargain and deal with this union it would have given up certain substantial rights which it has under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.171" offset="4660663">In the first place, if this were a complying union that had made that demand the employer could have said, "Well now we do not accept your protestation of majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.679" offset="4730671">You see that you represent a majority but we wish to have a board supervised secret election."</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.558" offset="4758152">As one of things that was kept -- would have been taken away from us if we had volunteer to recognize this union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.789" offset="4815099">If Your Honor please, the Board itself has held that it will not entertain a petition for an election even as to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.785" offset="4859089">Now, it's obvious that the union could not go before the Board because it has not complied and that all the Board processes were denied to this union, and the Board is likewise held that we could not go with the Board under those circumstances and petition for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.108" offset="4928366">And the reasoning is this, if the Board found that the union did have a majority, the union on under such circumstances would be indirectly getting the benefit of the processes of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.596" offset="4982282">Now I have cited the several cases which the Board quotes that in the brief and that was one of the material things it was commented upon by the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.827" offset="5147272">Now, the obvious answer to that is that the brief filed by the Board in this case did not even intimate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.870" offset="5175380">We could have gone to the Board and obtained an election and of course the Board has so held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.773" offset="5219056">It just -- it based it under Section -- on Sections 9 (g) and (h), (f), (g), and (h) which denied the services of the Board and the processes of the Board to any non-complying union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.216" offset="5268793">And they say even if the employer is the one who asks for the election, we won't call it an election because if we finally decide that the union wins, we are indirectly defeating the purpose of the Act in giving the result of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.064" offset="5348206">And -- and they say further that if they should find, if they should hold an election and find that the union was successful and had a majority, they couldn't certify them because that is denied under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.628" offset="5402436">So that's one of the first things, there are several other disadvantages that we have given up on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.453" offset="5425737">I'm seeing at the outset the reasons why we object dealing with a non-complying union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.049" offset="5448098">Now, if Your Honors please, that's the -- that's the flat proposition that we have before this Court, whether we have to deal with -- and bargain with this non-complying union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.294" offset="5493133">Now I say this, if -- if we refuse to bargain with this union and Your Honors overrule the state court decision and let them put a picket line back, we still do not legally have to bargain with them because they can't go out before the Board and compel us to bargain with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.528" offset="5598041">That's obviously an unfair labor practice to refuse them -- to refuse to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.182" offset="5624686">So that the Board was -- is the only agency that have a right to hear that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.136" offset="5644539">But they have -- whoever shut them off, seals off, from any possible Board relief by refusing to comply with this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.901" offset="6655582">That's on the appendix, page 27 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.668" offset="6678570">Now, they have gone in that case, they say this, although it is the employer's petition in a Circuit case, and so on the next page 28, it sets the Board's machinery in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.189" offset="6736666">It is an individuals or a labor organization's initial claim for recognition that makes it possible for the employer to invoke that machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.819" offset="6771252">And it goes on to say that under the circumstances they will refuse even the employer any relief under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.187" offset="6824647">Now, so if the Court please, it seems to me that the question before the Court here is whether primary picketing by a non-complying union is either prohibited by the management Labor Relations Act or whether it is as an unfair labor practice or whether it is a fully protected right under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.685" offset="6950661">Now certain practices are enumerated in the Act as unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.260" offset="6980963">These are coercion of employees, coercion of an employer in selecting his negotiator, a union refusal to bargain, a secondary board cut and things of that type, finally they wind up with (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.082" offset="7036238">It is obviously not any one of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.274" offset="7045016">It is not an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.125" offset="7056405">Now, if this were an unfair labor practice under the Act, we could go before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.802" offset="7083154">But it clearly is not and I think the strongest proof or intimation that it is not an unfair labor practice is there is no intimation whatever in the Board's brief that it is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.544" offset="7134145">And the Board has held on a number of occasions that primary picketing for recognition by such a union is not an unfair labor practice and so the Board would not act on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.061" offset="7188167">Now, of course as this Court has said if it weren't an unfair labor practice, you would have a direct conflict between the Board and the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.022" offset="7260056">And in that case we would have an easy decision to the effect that the state courts had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.428" offset="7289626">So to pass from the unfair labor practice or easy phase of the case, we come to the cloudy or penumbral area as it had been referred to by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.185" offset="7356709">And parenthetically when I was attempting to reconcile the various state board, labor board and Federal Court of Appeal decisions, why, I could progressively appreciate the meaning of that word, penumbra, and I always had to come back to what I consider as a -- the (Inaudible) landmark cases regulating labor relations by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.749" offset="11978919">Now in the Anheuser-Busch case Your Honors stated that the federal Act has not absorbed all state action and it pointed out in the Allen Bradley, that in the Allen Bradley case, Allen Bradley Local against Wisconsin Board the states were permitted to enjoin mass picketing and blocking of plant entrances and picketing at homes and that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.768" offset="12095007">And in the International case of International Union against Wisconsin Board, the Court allowed a state injunction against the current wage stoppages, the current owner now for wage stoppages that had a tendency to upset the employer's manufacturing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.317" offset="12173166">And the Court stated that if the particular practice is neither prohibited nor sanctioned by the federal Act then it is left to the regulations of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.470" offset="12229799">Now, we say that there is no definite sanction or prohibition against primary picketing by a non-complying union in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.321" offset="12273267">Now as -- I do not believe that Section 7 and 13 of the Act, in the light of the history of these sections was intended to grant protection in a case of this type where the union has not complied with the direct mandate of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.214" offset="12344842">In the case of International Union against Wisconsin Board, this Court stated that right granted in Section 7 contemplates a lawful strike and does not legalize any and every type of concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.529" offset="12402103">Now I say that under the rulings of these cases and a further statement of the Court at Section 7 (c) and 13 do not give any special dispensation to the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.558" offset="12454139">But outlaw strikes to enforce labor practice to enforce unfair labor practices that this Court could well hold that a strike under these circumstances which denies us the rights which we say we have under the Act is neither prohibited nor protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.324" offset="12541283">Under the -- I believe it to broad purposes of the Wagner and the Taft Acts were to eliminate the economic loss it tendered upon strikes in every case where it was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.063" offset="12596245">Now, you take this particular case right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.806" offset="12607216">If this were a complying union and made a demand for recognition, they would not have to strike to get it, they could go before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.353" offset="12649326">Now if that had been true and we had refused and they had gone before the Board, why, the employees would have been still earning wages and the company would have been in production, you've had no interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.360" offset="12697391">I think if that is a type of thing its intended to be brought about by the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.277" offset="12749009">There's no material change in either of these sections in the -- from the Wagner Act to Taft-Hartley Act in the Act, in the later Act in 1947 Amendment, the conspiracy weapon was taken away from the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.578" offset="12818286">In other words, any union action, it was otherwise lawful was not made unlawful simply because it was undertaken by several persons in concert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.163" offset="12856633">And I believe it those were the principle changes that were made in Section 713 in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.224" offset="12892891">And this Court in the Laburnum case stated that in the Garner case the very care which the Court took to point out that if a -- that if a conflict existed the state court must yield, was in itself on assertion that if there was no conflict then a state action would survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.973" offset="12983798">I say that in this case there cannot possibly be any conflict between the state court and the National Labor Relations Board for the simple reason that this Board has forever shut itself off from any possible remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4169.981" offset="16679915">I -- I just want to discuss a case that I started to mention a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.156" offset="16700604">In one case, a union was recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.386" offset="16733518">It was not certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.029" offset="16740101">The employer voluntarily recognized the union, and the union went before the Board and asked for a certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.041" offset="16768104">And employers says that there's no need for a certification, an election because I have already recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.726" offset="16794854">And yet in that case the Board says that there are certain advantages attached to the status of a certified union and even though the employer has recognized the union you are entitled to go ahead and have the election and be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.861" offset="16851383">Now that's -- that is a stamp of -- puts a stamp of approval on a -- the Board of the advantage of dealing with a certified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.236" offset="16892865">Now, that's one of the things that we think that they'd do under the broad purposes of the Act.</text>
