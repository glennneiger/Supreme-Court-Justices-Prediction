            <label>Mr. Ashton L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="40.133" offset="160496">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.036" offset="168124">This is a boundary dispute between the States of Mississippi and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.597" offset="190380">The dispute actually is made up of two separate areas involving two separate disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.798" offset="219115">The first one is what has been spoken of in the trial and in the briefs as a Diamond Island Towhead area.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.988" offset="251925">I believe I have some charts here from the offerings which will demonstrate more forcefully than what I can say the point at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.196" offset="312738">The Mississippi River in the 1860s that's flowing in this manner, down here, originally as it's probably straight but the point here spoken of is Diamond Point was gradually built and built it -- built out of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.815" offset="403226">And somewhere between 18 -- back in 1866, there was an avulsion that took place that is the water cut itself a new channel through here and left this tip out in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.933" offset="463726">Of course, under the law, the avulsion did not change the boundary with reference to the ownership of this particular island that remained in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.974" offset="507820">Now, the question here in this particular dispute is where shall that boundary be?</text>
            <text syncTime="134.056" offset="536137">The -- this Court in Arkansas versus Tennessee in 1918 had this to say with respect to boundaries that are in running streams between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.160" offset="592562">It is said it's simply beyond the possibility of dispute that whenever a boundary is in a running stream and that stream is moved by the processes of erosion on one side and accretion to the other that the boundary continues with the stream and is not left behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.884" offset="671451">In that case, the question there involved was the exception to that general rule, which is the case of an avulsion when the channel suddenly takes another course and leads or abandoned its former course.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.321" offset="745221">In that case, the Court went on to say that in the case of an avulsion, the channel remains in the former stream and continues to remain there and to be moved by the processes of erosion and accretion so long as that old stream remains a running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.177" offset="852637">That is the point, the interpretation of that very language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.476" offset="873848">The Special Master has cited the case of Arkansas versus Tennessee in his opinion and he has read into the language there that since the thalweg or the deepest portion of the channel is what is meant in the -- all of the jurisprudence of this Court as to where the boundary would be that when this Court used the word so long as this old channel remains a running stream, the Special Master has added to those words that so long as that is a running stream at low water or it seems to me that he has added additionally and is not subject to navigation at low water.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.638" offset="1094531">In other words, the crux of this case is what do the word "running stream" mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.495" offset="1125878">It is demonstrated, I would say very forcefully by this particular point here which was the point up stream from the island that the Master recommended be fixed as the upstream end of the boundary that is going to the main and the old channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.414" offset="1213649">This was -- this chart here was made by Suter's, chart made in 1874 from a reconnaissance of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.461" offset="1249802">Now, our position is that if this remaining running stream and if this, the deepest portion of this old channel, the thalweg mended or was moved by the processes of erosion and accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.269" offset="1321064">By then, this Court has already stated that that boundary was moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.583" offset="1338305">I believe we can better demonstrate by the next chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.719" offset="1358785">This is an excerpt from a Mississippi River Commission survey, different in some respect from the Suter reconnaissance.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.652" offset="1398596">This is the identical same area, four years to six years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.648" offset="1430570">This chart was finished on a survey made by the Mississippi River Commission during the years 1878, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.347" offset="1465365">It obviously showed a channel, still running there to the mouth of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.570" offset="1494204">It obviously showed that some portion of Louisiana here has been built out.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.323" offset="1529208">We have superimposed on this chart since the Master has decided this location of the boundary where it should be at the time that low water first ceased the flow to that old channel and this is it in red line.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.311" offset="1597231">It is clear that that red line goes across land.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.623" offset="1618442">Yet, the channel has still moved on and is still in existence here at the time of this survey in 1878 and 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.947" offset="1667762">To get to the point of issue here, what land is being part of that, we believe that this chart will better demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.533" offset="1710080">I can locate here the last remnant of this little island that is right in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.270" offset="1744980">Now, of course, the Mississippi River through building on this right bank of the Mississippi had pushed on down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.130" offset="1776431">This chart is in 1937-1938 and it has pushed on much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.299" offset="1797120">We used it so the Court would not become confused for the channel is still here too, down south of this particular bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.889" offset="1831497">The Special Master held that this point S was out here, some mile and a fraction upstream from the vast head of the island as was shown on this survey made in 1878-1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.931" offset="1915716">The Master has projected this line around here and then projected it down across the accretion this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.937" offset="1947690">And it is our contention that that line has been erroneously placed and it should be at the -- in the last channel when the water ceased to flow and there was no longer a running stream around that island.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.870" offset="1999412">And if that be so, this is where Louisiana suggests that the line should be here, the streamline here.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.446" offset="2033685">This therefore under this particular phase of the case is the land in dispute insofar as the record is now concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.393" offset="2069525">Originally, I might say that when this suit was first filed and accomplished in much greater area of land, completely around that way, I believe all the down here of many, many thousands of acres but by stipulations, it has been reduced to this point and the other point that I will discuss shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.334" offset="2165238">Now, we say that a running stream continues to be a running stream --</text>

            <text syncTime="604.517" offset="2417998">That's the way it was -- has been spoken of historically and it's shown in that manner on old many charts and it was used, been given that name during a hearing and still being used in all the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.164" offset="2472647">In other words, the Diamond Point, Louisiana admitted that it was a point broad that was built out from Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.546" offset="7886158">So, the next problem, if there are no other questions with reference to this particular old channel here when water last ceased to flow involved actually the same legal point and that is where shall the channel be fixed on the southerly side of those accretions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.432" offset="7965675">Remember that the channel was north of Diamond Point, nesting the Diamond Point was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.016" offset="7992007">That same channel used to be up here and flowing around here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.860" offset="8007367">And then after the avulsion, it flowed around here and has had meanders there and to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.694" offset="8026697">And our point is, that so long as this channel has a running stream in it, and is subject to causing the processes of erosion and accretion and subject to cause this land or this channel to meander while the boundary remains an active boundary there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.696" offset="8118753">The Special Master held that when the water first ceased to flow in this channel here, at low water that the boundary has been became fixed, despite the fact that this channel may have meandered on down considerably, the Master spoke of a third of a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.973" offset="8211853">I believe it's a third to half a mile on some of the evidence that has meandered on down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.543" offset="8238080">In other words, we can see that from the Master's line here that he stopped in the thalweg of this old lane Mississippi, goes over and then come down this old channel which he says was abandoned when the first low water flowed through there and then goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.429" offset="8309656">He does not take it through and still in the old channel which we say continues to flow and we believe is forcefully demonstrated by two things here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.572" offset="8678191">We further offered in evidence the water stages taken by the Mississippi River Commission for the year 1953 and had identified by one of their engineers who was an employee of Mississippi River Commission who testified for them in a private capacity that he took the water stage to the -- when water was ceased to flow in here at a stage of the river at 16.2 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.440" offset="8809744">When water was in this river here, 16.2 feet, it did not flow in this channel across here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.063" offset="8848196">But when water rose above 16.2 feet, it did flow in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.076" offset="8868258">In accordance with this information here form Mississippi River Commission as to the depths of the water there, we find that this old channel here, even in 1953 and at the time we tried this case is with the latest information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.089" offset="8928340">Flowed commencing on February, the 18th and 19th continued for the rest of February, all of March, all of the April all of May and through June the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.683" offset="8986645">The highest that the water got at any time of any portions of the river was 33.52 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.800" offset="9027187">So, it is obvious that the difference between 16th in the fraction of feet is 30 feet, it had that flow in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.125" offset="9064490">Now, of course, it was testified that 1953 was a relatively low water flow, because as this information is here to the effect that flood water is at 43 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.875" offset="9119451">In other words, it was still flowing through here through this old channel for -- about four months of the year 1953, and it was considerably less than the 43-foot flood stage as high as three fifths and 33 in a fraction feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.488" offset="9205864">We also had much evidence in the record to the effect that since the Master's had fixed the channel here, having ceased to flow that it had meandered some 1400 feet, continued on meandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.126" offset="9296457">Therefore, the processes of erosion and accretion were in full effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.815" offset="9327177">That, we submit will take care of the boundary around the island and will divide up the accretion because all of this was in Louisiana, but the dispute is between these two lines and there's no dispute on this side of the channel of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.457" offset="9397812">In summary, I would just want to say on this particular part of the case, that the evidence which cannot be again said that there was a flow in that channel, as this particular chart of the Mississippi River Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.082" offset="9476284">It was a survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.836" offset="9487256">The -- there was no evidence that disputed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.975" offset="9503869">The theory that the Master got away from that was that no low water was flowing through that channel at the time of this survey, but it would be a considerable flow of much water through there subject to navigation at the time this chart was made since this was only at one-third of isolation above low water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.744" offset="9598955">And therefore, it was obviously and according to the -- the data that went with this chart, obviously that there was a running stream there and it's obvious that that is what caused this stream to move over from this particular line where the water ceased to flow and place of low water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.173" offset="9980656">The difference came about that Mississippi wanted to put the last channel which would stop those accretions there and when the water first ceased to flow at low water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.364" offset="10265391">The State of Mississippi contended and that they held that they should be divided by running a line at right angles to the successive thalwegs of the stream as it moved away.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.998" offset="10627971">It's in the record as a stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.593" offset="10638315">And we admitted the Diamond Point was a part of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.207" offset="10664751">In the stipulation, however, we did not admit what the boundaries of Diamond Point were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.578" offset="10694217">It is obvious that we were a complete (Inaudible) heads as to whether where the boundary on the north was because the same legal proposition is applicable to the north boundary of Diamond Point as it is to the south boundary of this Diamond Island towhead area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.316" offset="10761195">So, we did admit that and we didn't admit any boundaries and because with stipulations that are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.073" offset="10792229">Now, this particular point has to do with an island that was formed here, sometime approximately in 1925 or 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.215" offset="10844787">As you can see from this 1913 chart, the channel if you examine closely and one of the witnesses do this on it which we reproduced was, “Put the thalweg over here against the north bank of (Inaudible) bin,” that they speak of here, in the vicinity of where the island first formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.722" offset="10938828">The -- the question of course is on which side of the thalweg did the island first appear?</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.924" offset="10975608">Now, that would determine whether it would belong to Louisiana or to Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.524" offset="10998073">If it formed at this particular time in 1913 is positioned here, it will be obviously Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.023" offset="11640059">Now, if an island is formed or if that ceases to be the deepest channel because the next time is up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.569" offset="11722188">Now, the channel through the south of the area is slightly deeper, so that's where the thalweg would be there at the time of 1925-1926, but we say that the history actually is not there because the history shows that that north channel is a closing channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.430" offset="11805675">And therefore, a closing channel shows that it was the main channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.784" offset="11839112">As you can see, the channel here was the 1913 channel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.557" offset="11862204">It kept eroding back in here, as the 1920 channel, as the 1924 channel right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.992" offset="11887909">It kept eroding back over here and because of developments upriver from this particular point suddenly in 1925 or 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.882" offset="11931481">This channel ceased to be an eroding channel and became -- and in creating a channel because in 1926 back line suddenly comes back over here, the 1926 bank line, the green one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.199" offset="12000758">So, suddenly, it has changed all of its activities from an eroding channel back and it jumped back over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.719" offset="12026776">And during that interval of time, the island formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.560" offset="12042240">We say it is logical that the channel or the leading channel here, that's where the thalweg was and that Mississippi carried the burden of proof and there's no evidence here against that particular theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.353" offset="12133355">I think that we should immediately make known the facts that Mississippi finds itself in complete disagreement with Louisiana, when they say that there's no dispute of facts here and in complete disagreement as to what are the well established facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.832" offset="12223321">Likewise, we found ourselves in disagreement with Louisiana as to the applicable law of the case, as the conflicting briefs of each part into the suit will clearly demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.258" offset="12280999">When this suit was instituted, that was brought by the State of Mississippi to establish its right and sovereignty in the boundary line between the two states affecting an area of something over 20,000 acres of land that were being in whole or in part adversely claimed by Louisiana and which in Louisiana's answer, their certain title adverse to the title claim of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.990" offset="12407954">Subsequently, after the investigation of the case and proceeded by Louisiana, Louisiana did enter into two stipulations that appear in the record and in the Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.805" offset="12467200">One to the effect that prior to 1864 or 1865, a point bar had built out from Mississippi as alleged in Mississippi's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.916" offset="12531566">And that an avulsion occurred across this point of land separating a part of Mississippi from the rest of the mainland and they admitted that the part so separated was in the State of Mississippi, but proceeded then to claim all of the land around that separated part and to make this part of Mississippi a complete island surrounded not by water but by Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.777" offset="12959033">To demonstrate what I mean by that, it must be born in mind that this chart shows a situation after there had been an avulsion, but of course it must be born in mind with the State boundary between the State of Mississippi and Louisiana at that time followed that thalweg of course around the river and that this entire channel in here and supposed shoot cut-off channel toward Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.458" offset="13101767">It was Mississippi on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.901" offset="13115559">It was Mississippi all the way from -- from this point here down to this point below and that whatever filling in here was the effect of the avulsion and not the effect of erosion and accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.405" offset="13185567">And the location of those boundaries and that thalweg was clearly established by geologists, by experienced engineers and born in mind -- and born out, corroborated by the actual owned seen report of Major Charles R. Suter who made this reconnaissance survey in the year 1874, some several years after the occurrence of the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.146" offset="13316493">And at the conclusion or completion of the process of the avulsion, the shoot cut-off channel had been initiated as never as we can historically ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.897" offset="13367484">The claim the years 1864 and 1866, but Major Suter reported from his own name, seen the report to the Corps of Engineers on his reconnaissance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.832" offset="13431327">He made his report in 1875 in February, that it resulted a flood of 1874, he bend of Diamond Island had filled and the Mississippi River had established itself permanently in the shoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.263" offset="13501022">And that was a complete filling of that whole river bed without (Inaudible) around here and I'd jump to show on another map as being yet one with a running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.811" offset="13563193">The first controlled surveys of the Mississippi River Commission was one made from a reconnaissance surveys and actual controlled surveys of 1878 and 1880 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.301" offset="13621185">And the map of 1880, Exhibit 10 to the bill of complaint for the State of Mississippi in this case about which much testimony was taken, shows conclusively that the old channel that had existed around to the north and west of what is now known as Diamond Island Towhead had completely filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.503" offset="13729959">So far filled that at minimal water, you could not have -- you could -- there could be no entry of water there even at a stage of 20 feet above minimum water and it was perfectly dry completely across the old riverbed at the time of that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.234" offset="13816895">Now, counsel for Louisiana in their brief and in their exposition of the problem here before this Court have selected one chart, which they have denoted and reproduced in their brief as their plate one being the chart, which counsel says shows a stream of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.978" offset="13935909">That chart was one made from a number of manuscript charts of no definite period, and that no definite stage of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.390" offset="14001528">The stage in that particular area for whatever particular time it was, sometime after 1880 showed a stage of some 20 or more feet above minimal water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.746" offset="14074984">Much evidence was taken concerning this chart and we submit that it is not pertinent whatsoever to the establishment of the boundary line, or as has been demonstrated by the testimony of the witnesses and indeed seen by the Master who went on this particular area and made a first known inspection thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.546" offset="14198178">What is shown here is nothing more than one of a number of flood scoured out, drained channels that made from time to time be located first here then there, depending upon the overflow water of the Mississippi River during times of flood or high water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.556" offset="14294204">And the geologist, Dr. H. N. Fisk who was the Chief Geological Consultant for the Mississippi River Commission for many years and still occupies the position, in an advisory capacity and the control of the flows of the Mississippi River from Pittsburgh to the Gulf, advising the engineers and the President of the Mississippi River Commission, described that situation and said that it did not locate and did not approximate the abandoned thalweg or deep water channel line of the river course as it had existed at the time of the occurrence of the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.710" offset="14498795">That is was nothing more than a surfaced scour feature brought about by the washing or scouring effects of high water overflow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.606" offset="14546338">As the water would flow and for that manner if it please the Court, I think it is beyond dispute that at times of high water until the unofficial cut-offs have been constructed had now spin the water to the Mississippi River, this entire flood rain overflowed every year and would overflow this year and would overflow much vast of areas, pronounced that the construction of that isn't along the bank that protects the alluvial lands of the State of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.503" offset="14937966">That (Inaudible), it would be interesting to note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.129" offset="14956460">It has shown from such aerial mosaics the varying courses of the Mississippi River in the lower -- lower area or as my friend says, “For all recent times, some 20,000 years from the Texas border to the Mississippi Hills,” as it has meandered in that area and that sir can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.227" offset="15064816">His study of this area was of course of real recent time and he made actual borings on the ground, took deposits of gravels and sands and clays and came up with his expert opinion, which when he reproduced on the exhibits that are in evidence here, the former thalweg course of the Mississippi River without himself having at any time prior thereto have been familiar with the report of Major Suter so closely corresponded there with that it was quite remarkable and so closely does that we can say truthfully that the point of thalweg, that (Inaudible) shown on a Suter Map and those shown on the charts of Dr.Fisk are one and the same for all practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.522" offset="15306083">Now then, another way, sir, of getting at that is for an engineer familiar with the widening of Mississippi River such as Mr. Austin B.Smith, with the Mississippi River Commission and the Corps of Engineers, an active flood control work for 25 years who was in charged of the construction of some of these artificial cut-offs has seen these old channels become abandoned and clogged up and filled and can tell at what rate they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.196" offset="15436696">He can make calculations as he did by the calculated accretion rates and erosion rates and filling rates in abandoned channels and thereby locate to a close proximity, the situation as it existed at the time of the flow that the flow ceased in the old channel or when the avulsion was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.561" offset="15550171">The Special Master in this case had the benefit of that expert opinion evidence, but he also had the benefit of lay witnesses who justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.743" offset="15602939">Now, about this situation here, let's turn back to the reproduction of the Suter Map.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.597" offset="15654348">The evidence in the case shows and the chart of 1880 shows that upon the occurrence of this avulsion, the forces of the water flowing and divided as it were by the head of the island and the course of filling this abandoned channel caused a deposition of gravel bar as a part of this island between the divided flow of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.195" offset="15780780">And that that gravel bar, that deposition is yet there as justified by lay witnesses who had navigated in that area, who -- one who lived on the land and had seen where accretions had formed and know where they were, a steamboat captain and by the geologist for Louisiana who made the borings as well as Dr.Fisk, so that the Master was supported in his findings of fact by what he saw because he do saw the deposition of this gravel in that area and which he has reported therefore, never washed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.124" offset="15956428">And therefore, that the channel of the Mississippi River, the navigable channels have never been in such a contorted location as counsel for Louisiana now claim, but he was supported by those lay witnesses in addition to the experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.013" offset="16024033">Now, as we take it, the entire fallacy of Louisiana's argument in this case has been that whereas at the present moment, they may be required to confess that the word “thalweg” has an important bearing upon the determination of the boundaries in dispute has -- has long been established by this Court and it does not merely mean a valley way that it is related to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.662" offset="16162586">It is the course of navigation or the sailing main downstream and therefore that of the greatest amount of current as this Court has from time to time held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.134" offset="16208457">And that the thalweg doctrine is one which they have ignored in their entire presentation of this case and they seized upon the use -- an informant by this Court in the case of Arkansas versus Tennessee of language that gave them hope when the Court spoke of the stream becoming stagnant or as long as there's water is flowing, it is susceptible of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.682" offset="16326635">But of course what this Court meant, when that navigable channel is filled and when the water -- the current ceased to flow therein, then the boundary is fixed in that old channel as this Court has defined it to wit in the navigable channel, in the -- along the thalweg of the navigable channel as that thalweg as such last existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.300" offset="16457143">And so, it is that the Court, the Master below has so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="4539.411" offset="18157610">We had gone along in the trial of the case and we were -- Mississippi was quite concerned as to why we seem to be -- there should be in the confusion in the Master's mind to ours as to what we were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.000" offset="18211944">It was quite apparent we -- we're not using the same language and the witnesses did mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.573" offset="18234201">Louisiana introduced a Mr. (Inaudible), as a geological expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.110" offset="18256353">They introduced a Mr. (Inaudible) as a geological expert and they predicated their whole case upon that testimony and Mr. Stewart had predicated his whole argument here on maps which were drawn at his instance on this map by these two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.576" offset="18322286">Now, what did those witnesses state, by Mr. McKamy?</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.880" offset="18335451">“Mr. (Inaudible), will you tell us your definition of thalweg?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.324" offset="18353215">Answer - “Thalweg, sir, is a deep portion or zone of a stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.070" offset="18372232">My understanding here is that it's derived from the German word valley way and in a stream therefore would have a thalweg by that definition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.905" offset="18407549">Do you -- you do not refer it in either way to navigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.706" offset="18422805">“No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.048" offset="18428134">So therefore, the -- the geologists and the attorney, both for the State of Louisiana are using words that are -- with one definition when the Supreme Court of the United States in boundary disputes has given that word a very distinct meaning and that it's -- of the Louisiana's used of the word is in direct conflict with that of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.013" offset="18512039">Now, with Mr. Waldo's testimony by Mr. Brandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.639" offset="18530534">“Mr. Waldo, what is your understanding of the term thalweg?</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.814" offset="18543177">Have you studied a little bit of German, sir, use the word -- use the translation valley way?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.325" offset="18565224">You do not know its definition then it matters pertaining to the navigation of boundaries, when it is referred to in reference to the application of the thalweg doctrine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.571" offset="18602214">“Sir, I have never done any research toward boundary of determination nor I have been affiliated within the navigation on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.072" offset="18636278">So, I'm afraid I wouldn't be familiar with the thalweg doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.442" offset="18649757">The Louisiana is here basing its case upon testimony of witnesses who are not even familiar with the thalweg doctrine and the cause is advanced by Louisiana, it's predicated upon a theory made up of that witnesses in contrary to the thalweg doctrine as announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.858" offset="18711406">Now, further with Mr. (Inaudible) testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.079" offset="18720287">“You did not concern yourself with the location of that thalweg as it existed, as all the approximate date of January 1830 -- January 1933, shortly thereafter, in an attempt to locate anything concerning boundaries or the fixation of the navigable channel prior to the effective making of the cut-off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.204" offset="18796774">Also, on the thalweg, in my mind, it is a rather wide and definite zone and I don't feel that it can be pinpointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.969" offset="18835853">So, I didn't concern myself too much with it and that's how Louisiana has treated the thalweg doctrine as announced first in this Court by in the Illinois versus -- Iowa versus Illinois and put to rest in several cases and probably the -- the best discussion of the thalweg doctrine being in the case in New Jersey versus Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.108" offset="18912340">I was somewhat amazed to hear Mr. Stewart tell this Court that there was no testimony showing that the island, south of Diamond Point, there was no testimony to warrant its -- the Master awarding it to Mississippi and that there was no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.823" offset="18987259">Now, he is correct in saying that there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.127" offset="19000424">But when he -- he is mistaken when he said that there is a dispute that it belongs to Louisiana because there's not a scintilla of evidence in this record, not a scintilla to show that that island ever belonged to Louisiana, was ever formed anywhere close to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.656" offset="19066567">Now, what happened is this.When this old channel south of Diamond Point, again to deteriorate after the construction of the cut-off of 1933 by the United States Government across the base or neck of Diamond Point, the United States Government saw that the main channel of the river would go through the cut-off, filled up the lower end the river, fill up the lower end of -- of the channel around Diamond Point to stop the flow, to keep it from being a flowing stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.370" offset="19213479">And as that channel deteriorated, the island formed out in the river and formed to the north of the thalweg of the main navigable channel to Mississippi River, being on the Mississippi side of the thalweg of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.493" offset="19289966">The main thalweg of the Mississippi River was to the south of this island and in due course within a few years, by the process of accretion that became attached to the Mississippi mainland, it is now a part and attached to the Mississippi mainland and it always has been on the Mississippi side of the thalweg of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.137" offset="19376483">Now, Your Honor please, let me read you so that -- so you can see how wrong Mr. Stewart was when he told you that there was nothing in this record to warrant the Master awarding that to Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.795" offset="19427161">This is the plain testimony taken from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.457" offset="19445760">Mr. McKamy - The main thalweg is south of the island in 1926, is it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.514" offset="19470002">Witness, and incidentally, that witness is (Inaudible), the man who says that the word thalweg means “valley way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.821" offset="19503229">So, when Mr. Stewart walked over here and put his hand on (Inaudible) the thalweg was up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.368" offset="19521411">It was a deep portion of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.320" offset="19529247">Therefore, it was a thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.457" offset="19537816">But gentlemen, that has no -- that has no legal significance and is legally wrong and is in direct conflict what this Court's held in every one of these decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.633" offset="19578462">The witness, “I would say that the deepest thalweg is south and when the -- within the next two years, this becomes the only thalweg.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.701" offset="19614720">Mr. Clifton - “I think Your Honors are entitled to an answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.572" offset="19634260">Was the main thalweg south?</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.240" offset="19644918">I would like to ask the witness if he can understand that question and answer it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4937.220" offset="19748780">Mr. McKamy - “Have you got a 1933 map here that shows the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.051" offset="19768111">By Mr. (Inaudible) “Yes, sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="4953.411" offset="19813564">Mr. McKamy - “By 1928, it shifted way down here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.188" offset="19828715">“Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.835" offset="19831327">By 1929, shifted into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.563" offset="19842194">Still further south shows that thalweg to be cutting on this side, the right bank?”</text>

            <text syncTime="4964.875" offset="19859435">The witness - “Yes, sir, cutting south of that island and by 1902, sir, as demonstrated on those photographs which in Louisiana's Exhibit number 23, the area of the sand bar that has been discussed, I will mark it an A.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.793" offset="19919099">By that time, during minimal low water, there is no flow whatsoever around the north.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.364" offset="19941355">Mr. McKamy - “In other words, it became attached to the left bank being the Mississippi bank?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.491" offset="19965910">Witness - “Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.036" offset="19972075">By its abandonment of that channel to the north, it's now completely to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.513" offset="19990047">They retreated the bank to the south as been previously alluded to as occurring between 1926 to 1929 and is still continuing as can be seen by the caving bank along here from the point between B -- blue and cyan blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.964" offset="20051801">So, that's the channel that previously existed north of the said sand bar as for the time of the photographs, Louisiana's Exhibit Number 23, then completely abandoned by high water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.703" offset="20090776">Mr. McKamy - “This is Louisiana's witness, the only maps that you can show that this island, the first time it appears on the map shows its north of the main thalweg?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.801" offset="20135184">“Yes, sir, on the 1925-1926 map.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.362" offset="20157440">Now, that's Louisiana's witness and yet Louisiana's counsel tells you that there's no evidence based on Master's finding that that island is in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.397" offset="20189518">There is not one scintilla of evidence in this record that that island was ever on the Louisiana side of the thalweg of the Mississippi River and it's -- it has never been anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.085" offset="20236330">In the charts of 1918 to 1915 of the Mississippi River Commission, it doesn't show the appearance of any islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.639" offset="20270498">And every succeeding chart it's published and put out by the Mississippi River Commission shows no islands at all in the formation of the river until 1925 and on 1925, it shows that island appearing on the north of the thalweg of the main channel of the Mississippi River and is attached to the Mississippi main island now and is a part of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.194" offset="20356702">There is not as the Special Master has found in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.486" offset="20377913">There is no testimony to show that it is in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.782" offset="20391079">It is conclusively shown by Dr.Fisk, by Dr.-- by all of the witnesses and every other person that's testified in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.907" offset="20423576">So, there can't be any question of a doubt that that island, regardless of whether Mr. Stewart may walk up to your map and say, “Look, I'm going to put a map up there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5120.814" offset="20483239">It's not the thalweg that this Court described and fixed in Iowa versus Illinois being the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.709" offset="20506749">Now, if Your Honor please, let's talk about just for a moment the boundary around Diamond Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.846" offset="20535380">Mr. Stewart has said all through his argument, when a surrounding stream and the Chief Justice asked him again, “In your state decisions, do they have a thalweg?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.661" offset="20590550">Those decisions do not and Mr. Stewart answered back, “Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.558" offset="20602149">They have a thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.805" offset="20607164">Every stream has a thalweg.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.095" offset="20616359">But we are not talking about water courses and the water ways as the case has cited in the brief of Louisiana that's been filed so recently in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.153" offset="20656588">We are talking about the Mississippi River as a navigable stream which forms a boundary between two sovereign states in a given area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.765" offset="20690965">As Mr. Brandon has said, when this case was originally filed, it involved some 25,000 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.045" offset="20720118">And by a process of admissions and by process of stipulations on the part of Louisiana, we've gotten down now to a where it only involved whether or not a -- a dry bank, 20 feet above the water is a running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.305" offset="20781140">Now, if Your Honor please, that is literally what happened and that is clearly covered in the Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.104" offset="20804336">There can be no question about that because Mr. Stewart and Mr. Lancaster that's seated in this room today with what the Special Master when he took the trip on -- going down to Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.312" offset="20845192">We went down and all of us went down to Mississippi River to see this old abandoned channel around Oak Bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.992" offset="20871941">Now, the United States engineers built this Diamond Point cut-off to the base of Oak Bend in aid of navigation and flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.511" offset="20909976">And the -- when they constructed that cut-off channel in there and took the main body of the Mississippi River from the old Oak Bend channel and placed to do the Oak Bend channel, it fully occupied that channel by 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.898" offset="20971520">All of the navigation rights were taken out -- out of the old Oak Bend channel and it was closed to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.876" offset="20995448">None -- no one -- none of the Masters of the Boats were notified that it was -- it was a sailing channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.506" offset="21018018">They were all notified that it was no longer a sailing lane for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.257" offset="21032960">They were all notified up and down the river that the tows had moved up and down in commerce, that it was no longer navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.214" offset="21060754">Mr. Stewart says, “What has navigation to do with the fixing of a boundary?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.479" offset="21077891">This Court has repeatedly held that navigation is the criteria upon which the fixation of a boundary between two states in a navigable stream is predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.966" offset="21119791">Now, the Master says, “By 1930 and certainly by 1940, no water flowed in the old abandoned channel around Oak Bend, certainly at low water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.221" offset="21176842">Well, what is (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.895" offset="21187500">Ironically, that is not beyond to -- construe it to say anything different that we are talking about the main Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.282" offset="21221042">We're talking about the main Mississippi River that forms the boundary between these two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.781" offset="21251030">We are talking about the Mississippi River that has the thalweg that's utilized in the commerce of the world by taking tows which the more tonnage is going up and down that river today than ever before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.956" offset="21295752">When we went down there, we parked that (Inaudible) on the bank of the river and we walked right straight up the riverbank 20 feet high.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.183" offset="21324696">And when we got up there on the 20 -- up on -- up a bank 20 feet above the flowing water, we looked out this way and that was a flowing river.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.541" offset="21358132">And strange as it might seem, two of the biggest tows on the Mississippi River passed through the opening of -- of Diamond Point cut-off at the time we were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.175" offset="21388643">We looked back out into this area back into the old channel of the old deserted channel and what was there?</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.322" offset="21409228">Sand, debris, a few pools of stagnant water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.469" offset="21433783">Now, that is what Louisiana is saying to this Court that they're now are contending as the running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.195" offset="21460741">They are now contending to you that it doesn't make any difference how high the water goes if a little water can trickle and then cause a little caving, it's a bank that the boundary will be fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.206" offset="21504731">And that is impossible under the law as announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.514" offset="21521972">We simply say to you, Your Honor please, that this is a report -- may I say in my limited experience, one of the finest reports of the Master that I've ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.233" offset="21572859">It was -- it was one of the ablest lawyers that I have ever seen who was appointed by this Court as Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.169" offset="21604624">I never have seen a Court that was presided over with more dignity and grace and more consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.088" offset="21628343">One of the finest reports I have ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.647" offset="21638583">It's fully justified by the evidence it introduced in this case and we certainly say that the Master's report should be confirmed and a decree entered accordingly.</text>

          <turn speaker="ashton_l_stewart" startTime="5426.835" stopTime="5581.272">
            <label>Mr. Ashton L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5426.835" offset="21707337">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.615" offset="21714442">I would just like to conclude on what I think is the only issue in the Court, before this Court and it is still a legal form that is on the Diamond Point here, the Diamond Island towhead here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.232" offset="21776927">That point is as this Court has held that in a case of an avulsion, so long as the old channel remains a running stream, capable of erosion and accretion that a boundary remains in that stream and that's the only point involved here and a lot of (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.633" offset="21854459">Now, in Arkansas versus Tennessee, here is the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.807" offset="21871177">I have quoted heretofore from the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.108" offset="21884343">The decree in that case is that they have pointed a Commission through -- get the nature and extent of the erosions and accretions that occurred in the old channel prior to its abandonment by the current as a result of the avulsion in 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.937" offset="21971696">And the question whether it is practical now to locate accurately the line of the river as it been running.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.369" offset="21997401">In other words, they appointed a Commission to find out what happened to the old channel by locating the erosions and the accretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.054" offset="22040137">They spoke nothing of any low water channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.170" offset="22056647">A running stream is a running stream whether it has low water running stream or not, so long as it continuously running, has a bed on the sides and banks and it conveys water in a channel that are -- is usually in customary for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.776" offset="22123102">Therefore, the only question on this point that we -- hear the argument of that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.386" offset="22149538">When does a stream ceased to be a running stream?</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.655" offset="22170540">We say that this Court has said in Arkansas versus Tennessee, it's when the processes of erosion and accretion have ceased and the water is stagnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.870" offset="22215471">That it ceased to be a running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.449" offset="22229786">Those processes of erosion and accretion take place in a running stream that do not take place otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.129" offset="22252460">So if the Court is going to followup this decision here which is based on logic that is if whenever a boundary is in a stream, that boundary moves with the stream, we would like to submit it on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.817" offset="22319229">We think the briefs amply cover --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="5581.272" offset="22325081">Mr. Stewart, you would say that your thalweg is related to a running stream no matter how small, has nothing to do with navigation, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ashton_l_stewart" startTime="5589.600" stopTime="5698.992">
            <label>Mr. Ashton L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5589.600" offset="22358309">Well, I -- I can spend considerable time to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.298" offset="22369176">That of course is not my position, none whatsoever, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.562" offset="22382237">My position is exactly that -- what a thalweg is, it's the main navigation of a stream -- main navigational point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.170" offset="22408673">And the Court has repeatedly concluded it as a valley way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.027" offset="22420062">As I say, that is a side issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.840" offset="22427272">That has nothing to do with the issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.001" offset="22439915">That's a play on words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.168" offset="22448588">We say that the only issue here is when is a running stream ceased to be a running stream?</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.705" offset="22470740">And we say that this Court has already decided that point and I say that that is in logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.252" offset="22492996">That is following the general theory that whenever a boundary is in a running stream, that boundary changes with the change of the stream by the processes of erosion and accretions and we don't believe we have any question involved on -- that's even debatable actually if the Court will just examine that case and this chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.149" offset="22584529">There was much said just now about whether -- there be no evidence to support our statement that this chart shows that this is a running stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.737" offset="22614936">We haven't showed that this channel here at its narrowest point was 300 feet wide, 300 feet wide and that's not a channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.936" offset="22647641">That's a survey channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.843" offset="22659344">Counsel referred to as a flow -- overflow water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.648" offset="22678570">The chart shows that it is one-third of oscillation, a stream (Inaudible) above low water and that's about 14 feet, the height of that channel thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.587" offset="22718276">That's some 30 feet away from high flood water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.601" offset="22738338">We submit the case and let's hear some answers to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.965" offset="22751817">Thank you.</text>
