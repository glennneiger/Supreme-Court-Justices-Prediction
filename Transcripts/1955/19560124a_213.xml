            <label>Mr. J.F. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="44.212" offset="176797">The Government brought this case to this Court because it felt that there had been a very serious misconstruction of a statute below.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.821" offset="219220">The statute in question is Section 340 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.615" offset="270420">The Government had instituted proceedings under that Section against the respondent to revoke his naturalization because of a long series of willfulness representations and material concealments by which he had obtained that naturalization in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.701" offset="390792">The Government commenced the proceedings by filing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.350" offset="409391">In that complaint the text of the misrepresentations was set forth at length and there was also a section in which the Government alleged there had been good cause for the institution of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.215" offset="500820">But the judge felt that in addition there had to be an affidavit of good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.841" offset="531331">Now very briefly the Government feels that there is nothing in the statute that requires this additional affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.807" offset="563200">The Government feels that this section does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.992" offset="583889">First, let me correct my -- let me insert a remark here.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.952" offset="607713">The Government's position is that the only reference in this section to an affidavit of good cause and I'll read the statute in a moment, is in the part in which an affirmative duty is imposed on the United States Attorneys to act when they might not act otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.258" offset="701022">That's where the affidavit of good cause appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.673" offset="718681">The Government feels that on proper construction this section does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.119" offset="744385">First, it says it shall be the duty of United States Attorneys will institute proceedings for denaturalization and it says when that duty arises upon an affidavit of good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.087" offset="808333">And the second part of the section separated in a different part of the sentence as the part of it -- I mean an entirely different paragraph as to the rest tells what the benefits for the defendants are to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.100" offset="860369">That is it affirmatively and clearly sets forth a 60-day notice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.682" offset="882625">Now that is the Government's feeling about it and perhaps the best way to get at that is to present the statute before the Court and I'll take the liberty of reading it and I'll try to read it without any inflection and without any slanting if I can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.919" offset="955664">It's presented in the Government brief at page 2, if you have that before you and I read, “It shall be the duty of the United States Attorneys for the respective districts upon affidavit showing good cause therefore to institute proceedings in any court specified in subsection (a) of this -- subsection 310 of this Title, in the judicial district in which the naturalized person, citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling a certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.932" offset="1191706">Now there are asterisks in the Government's copy and what follows in those asterisks there is some language as to the effect of the revocation and a special provision concerning contempt of court as an additional ground for revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.609" offset="1250429">And then that next sentence as you can observe as a provision for the defendants that are not residing in the United States and then there is the separate paragraph b and again I start reading that's on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.470" offset="1301838">(b) the party to whom was granted the naturalization alleged to have been procured by concealment of a material fact or by willfulness representation shall in any such proceedings under subsection (a) of this Section have 60 days personal notice unless waived by such party.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.355" offset="1393371">The rest of it I don't believe I need to read because the contrast of that second part with the first part is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.317" offset="1425241">I have outlined somewhat roughly how this case arose, that is the proceeding was commenced by a formal complaint in which the Government charged the willfulness representations by which the naturalization was originally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.810" offset="1499220">And the statute --</text>

            <label>Justice Sherman Minton</label>

            <label>Mr. J.F. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="394.022" offset="1576020">The respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.724" offset="1582811">Now, the respondent had these objections to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.900" offset="1603500">They were two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.073" offset="1612278">One of them is before this Court, the other is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.245" offset="1620950">The first one is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.856" offset="1631399">But I have to mention it because the respondent added it to the statement of facts in his brief so I don't want to go ahead with the argument without having that here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.931" offset="1675703">He contented first that the complaint failed to give fair notice of the Government's claim and then his second contention was that he had an absolute right to an affidavit of good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.634" offset="1726485">Now that first point was decided against the respondent by a judge who as you know decided for him on the other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.710" offset="1754802">That point isn't before the Court but since it's been injected and also since it's referred to tangentially in another part of respondent's brief, I feel the Court should have the answer to it that the judge himself made.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.283" offset="1809032">And the best way to do that again is to read from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.065" offset="1828258">He said that there was no lack of detail and here is his language when he talked about the complaint which was filed in this proceeding, I'm reading the judge's words, record 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.781" offset="1907043">I read, “It sets forth the alleged act which made the procurement of defendant's naturalization illegal and he allegedly concealed and misrepresented facts with what well maybe unnecessary specificity for a civil complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.286" offset="1977051">In view of this it would appear that the defendant is merely saying that a better complaint should have been drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.784" offset="2003069">However it is not the function of this Court to pass on the artistic merits of pleadings,” citing the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.237" offset="2028878">The complaint not only gives the defendant fair notice of the Government's claim, but it also informs him of the alleged facts upon which that claim is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.421" offset="2077675">The motion to dismiss the complaint because it is procedurally inadequate is therefore denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.966" offset="2103798">And that has not been brought to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.920" offset="2115605">Now the point is of collateral interest, although we didn't try to make use of it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.006" offset="2139951">We make use of it now somewhat, I would say in retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.816" offset="2159177">It's of interest because it shows that the demand for an affidavit clearly doesn't rest on any need for detail that the respondent was not deprived of any detail here and the judge who had him before his bench could see that very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.797" offset="2227096">The demand for filing an affidavit in this case rests upon the narrow contention that the statute some how requires it in every case and irrespective of any duplication or additional litigation that it may cause impractical effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.269" offset="2289058">Now I do not say that if the statute requires it that he shouldn't have it, but I do say that there is no lack of detail or extraneous reason to give it to him if he doesn't have it on the words of a statute which I have just read, which we think it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.281" offset="2365022">Now with respect --</text>

            <text syncTime="600.140" offset="2400549">But I'd add a purpose which the Chief Justice probably adverts to is to perhaps add some element of responsibility, I want to discuss that at greater length and I also want to --</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.715" offset="5354789">In the -- that general authority was considered in existence even at the time when this enactment first appeared in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.471" offset="5397838">There are citations both in the respondent's brief and ours in which there was a general practice of acquittal proceedings by which the U.S. Attorneys acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.713" offset="5442769">I might also refer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in Bindczyck for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.486" offset="5461891">So that what we have is a power in the United States Attorneys, but we do have a peculiar provision at the beginning of it to make the United States Attorneys act and I will show in the history why they felt there had to be these compulsions and I have had the addition of at least one similar incidence apparently which I am sorry that I have not explored here before us, an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.121" offset="5564395">Now, the -- I am still on the point of my objection to the opinion below the error, the first part of course is the failure to distinguish, the clean break in the first part of this statute from the second part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.765" offset="5635030">The second part uses language that no one would have any trouble with, it says, as I read, that the defendant shall have 60 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.579" offset="5674214">That's the way to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.782" offset="5679125">But you don't say that if an affidavit of good cause is filed it shall be the duty of the United States Attorney to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.202" offset="6376803">The Schwinn case we have cited in the brief was a case in which an affidavit was filed with the complaint but there was an objection in the Court of Appeals level that they had to -- that they had to furnish that affidavit to the U.S. Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.722" offset="6446811">And it was squarely presented to the Court of Appeals and it was squarely decided we think, not just dictum by the Court of Appeals that this is not a jurisdictional requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.839" offset="6519327">Now, the Court of Appeals was either so persuasive or the logic of it when one looks at the statute I don't know why, but the defendant in that case didn't even bring the argument about the affidavit to this Court, so that you are properly entitled to say that this Court did not pass upon the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.428" offset="6593620">But nevertheless this Court did sustain the revocation and I think that this Court with its occasional proclivity for acting sua sponte and in view of the seriousness with which this Court has looked at all revocation cases, I don't think this Court missed the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.648" offset="6674495">I think the point was there to see especially for anyone who looked at the lower court briefs and this Court affirmed a revocation in which there had been an issue below and in which the Court of Appeals' opinion which was before this Court squarely said this affidavit is not a jurisdictional requirement, period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.008" offset="9779931">Let me proceed backwards a moment as to this number of rounds, their final and decisive round on the fact of course is when you go to trial, you present your witnesses and then you have to put up your witnesses and there is the examination so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.985" offset="9859866">As soon as this complaint is filed, you have all the discovery proceedings, you have the depositions and that has been specifically provided by the Congress in contrast with the little that's provided about how this is to be tried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.488" offset="9921933">Now the Government does not want to have yet a third earlier go-round, I should say a first followed by two more by filing an affidavit having the lawyer who prepared an affidavit within the department and who is not going to be a witness, hold in on deposition, taking up the time of personnel and -- until it became a real problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.673" offset="10022661">You will find in the record a document which the attorney who verified this complaint had to file so that he wouldn't be holding and have his time wasted by asking a virtual trial on the facts for which he was not the witness.</text>
