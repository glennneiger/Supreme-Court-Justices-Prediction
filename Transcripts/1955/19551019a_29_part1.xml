            <label>Ms. Gloria Agrin</label>
            <text syncTime="39.220" offset="156839">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.788" offset="163109">The argument in this case falls into two very distinct categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.375" offset="185469">The first is a jurisdictional threshold question relating to justiciability and the second is the merit of the attack, the constitutional attack upon the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.480" offset="237819">I will discuss for the Court the threshold question and my associate Mrs. Freedman will discuss the merits when I have finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="275540">The appellee in this case is the District Director of Immigration and Naturalization in the Third Immigration District, which is where these appellants had deportation orders began against him and where the action against these appellants which is being here contested was began.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.580" offset="374282">The appellants are all aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.626" offset="390478">There are outstanding orders of deportation against these aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.446" offset="413780">The grounds of the deportation orders were membership after entry into the United States of the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.390" offset="461531">The validity of these orders of deportation are not being contested for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.194" offset="496744">More than six months have elapsed since the issuance of the final administrative orders of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.282" offset="533107">In fact, much more than six months has elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.421" offset="545646">These orders have not been effectuated because they either may not or cannot in fact be effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.627" offset="582426">The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 by Section 242 (d) thereof, that's found in Title VIII Section 1252 (d), provides in Section (a) -- well, at least 1252 provides in Section (a) and (b) for that period of time before the issuance of a final administrative order of deportation and for time up to six months after a final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.434" offset="737698">The contested Section 1252 (d) governs that time after six months after the making an issuance of a final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.673" offset="790674">The provisions of that statute are that aliens in such circumstances may be subjected by the Attorney General of the United States to what is called supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.716" offset="854831">They may be supervised in four ways under the terms of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.892" offset="875520">They may be required to report for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.180" offset="892656">They may be required to submit to medical and psychiatric examination when called and if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.446" offset="925780">They may be required to give information under oath concerning their nationality, circumstances, habits, associations and activities and any other question deemed fit and proper by the Attorney General, whether or not it relates to the enumerated class in that subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.417" offset="1017626">Then there is a carte blanche section, whereby the Attorney General is given the power to impose such other restrictions on the conduct and activity of those aliens as he may deem fit and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.377" offset="1085440">The Attorney General, after the passage of this Act, delegated the power granted to him by Section 1252 (d) to the District Director of Immigration in the district where the appellant had either, theretofore been retained, maintained or released on bail or parole conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.633" offset="1178436">The delegation of power to the District Director is in words or substantially in words of Section 1252 (d) itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.323" offset="1233189">The regulation does not provide for any procedure for the modification of an order of supervision which is issued under the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.926" offset="1275611">It does not provide for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.645" offset="1286478">It makes -- it sets up and creates no administrative remedy by which the validity or the reasonableness of an order of supervision may be contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.917" offset="1335589">This as the Court shall see will become important in terms of the argument made by the Government on justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.010" offset="1371951">The appellants here were placed under orders of supervision when six months had elapsed after the issuance of their deportation orders.</text>
