            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="57.910" offset="231549">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.557" offset="242207">I am accompanied, Your Honor, by Attorney General Brown of California, who has kindly yielded his time so that our time may not be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.274" offset="285048">This is a suit which was brought by the State of Arizona against the State of California and seven public agencies of our State to a quiet title to specific quantities of water from the Colorado River System for declaratory relief and for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.473" offset="389851">We are here upon exceptions to a report of a special master upon California’s motion to join the remaining four States of the Colorado River Basin, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, Nevada and the United States having intervened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.036" offset="492042">There are two groups of issues in the case, one relating to the claims of the States, the other relating to the claims of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.482" offset="537913">I may say that this is the fourth suit brought in this Court by Arizona relating to the waters of the Colorado River.It is the first in which he has not joined all of the other six States.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.182" offset="592666">The first action in 1931 was to set aside or declare void the Colorado River Compact and to declare invalid the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.707" offset="638746">A second suit in 1934 was to perpetuate testimony of the negotiators of the Compact to prove certain contentions of Arizona as to interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.139" offset="684513">And the third suit in 1935 was to ignore the Compact and for equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.218" offset="720771">This is not an equitable apportionment suit in which a State asked the Court to determine for it the quantity of water of an interstate stream theretofore undetermined as was the case in Wyoming versus Colorado, or Kansas versus Colorado, or Nebraska versus Wyoming, or even in the last Colorado River suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.305" offset="817215">Here, Arizona asked a Court to quiet title in perpetuity to quantities of water which she says have already been fixed and determined by the Colorado River Compact and the Boulder Canyon Project Act, which she already owns, that these quantities were fixed for the three States of Arizona, California and Nevada by the Colorado River Compact and that her share was carved out by the Boulder Canyon Project Act and contracts made thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.011" offset="967993">Now, I may say at the beginning that we think that Arizona overstates the collective rights of Arizona, California and Nevada against the upper States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming under the Colorado River Compact to the extent of about a million and half acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.231" offset="1064856">And if that is true, a decree based upon such an assumption would be futile, an advisory opinion and based upon a fallacy at that, unless the four upper States whose obligation is involved here and who must furnish 80% of the water or thereabouts involved in this suit are joined and bound by the adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.515" offset="1174047">Now, second, as to the claims of the United States, when the Government intervened here, it claimed a total of approximately 12 million acre-feet of water for various purposes which is about half again as large as the combined claims of Arizona, California and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.821" offset="1255236">These are for federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.287" offset="1269133">And in addition thereto, claimed an unspecified quantities, the right for the complete control of the river, the utilization of a full capacity of all of its reservoirs, aggregating some 28 million acre-feet for flood control navigation, treaty requirements and other federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.186" offset="1348650">We say that on the phase of the Government’s petition, these federal claims are claims against the waters of the entire system and not claims against Arizona, California and Nevada, and that they may not be adjudicated in the absence of all seven States.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.248" offset="1428898">We accordingly move to join the four upper States.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.622" offset="1442482">That motion was referred to a special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.600" offset="1454393">He filed a report, recommending adversely that our motion be denied except with respect to the States of New Mexico and Utah in their limited capacity with respect to the waters of the Lower Basin which I’ll explain in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.511" offset="1518028">He found that the Colorado River Compact, which I’ll shortly describe, so insulated the interest of the four upper States from the interest of the three lower States that these controversy, now before the Court, with respect to Arizona, California, Nevada and United States, although justiciable as to the present parties is not justiciable as to the absent parties in consequence of this insulation established by the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.679" offset="1630668">We maintained to the contrary that in the classic language from Shields versus Barrow, which has been the laws since 1855, that the absent states, not only have an interest in the controversy, but an interest of such a nature that a final decree with respect to the parties now before the Court cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving a controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience in the language of the Court and that they should be joined as necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.370" offset="1797433">I will deal with a question of justiciability as I describe the elements of the controversy now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.117" offset="1828467">First, with the respect to the issues arising from the Colorado River Compact, next, with respect to those arising from the Boulder Canyon Project Act as the effect of claims of the States, and finally, the independent claims of the United States as they affect all seven States in our view.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.117" offset="1936405">It has not asked for time at this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.574" offset="1946227">We are arguing in the dark to some degree as to the effect to the Government’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.901" offset="1971513">We take one view of the phase of the petition and what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.625" offset="1986456">We ask before the Master that the United States be called upon then and there to state whether his claims are against the waters of the entire system as we think they clearly must be for reasons I'll explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.125" offset="2032431">The Special Master declined the call upon the United States for clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.291" offset="2049149">He said he was going to obtain it but in a formal way later.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.282" offset="2065032">Judge Hayden died as you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.986" offset="2075899">So far as I know without obtaining from the Department of Justice such a clarification and we do not have here any formal statement from the Department of Justice except -- except a motion filed in this Court for a determination by the Court of what they call certain legal issues arising from the Master's report and which the Court overruled at the time that it granted oral -- the present oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.828" offset="2187285">This is essentially a suit on contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.793" offset="2203167">As I said, it is not like the equitable apportionment cases with which you're familiar heretofore.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.697" offset="2226782">There's a contract here between essentially the four upper States and the three lower States.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.727" offset="2250815">It's a suit on the contract, another contract which is evidence by the Boulder Canyon Project Act and a Limitation Act which the Project Act required the legislature of California to enact if the Project Act should become effective in 1929 without the ratification by Arizona of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.250" offset="2336914">Now, let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.403" offset="2345587">The Compact was signed in 1922 by the representatives of the seven States.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.010" offset="2367948">It was ratified promptly in January or shortly thereafter in 1923 by six legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.005" offset="2391980">Arizona's legislature rejected it, in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.095" offset="2408281">In 1925, the legislature of Colorado proposed reciprocal --</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="606.479" offset="2425835">They voted it down or in a legal act.</text>

          <turn speaker="northcutt_ely" startTime="608.776" stopTime="831.966">
            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="608.776" offset="2435030">They acted upon it and voted it down in both House as the journal of the legislatures bears on -- will show for 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.043" offset="2468153">In so doing, the reservations were offered, voted upon which would have the effect of excluding the Gila River from the Compact, I'll come to that point in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.291" offset="2505143">But even with those reservations, the Compact was voted down in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.810" offset="2531161">The State of -- the legislature of Colorado in 1925, to overcome this stalemate proposed reciprocal legislation, which would make the Compact effective as six-State document waiving ratification by the seventh.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.833" offset="2595318">And such legislation was enacted by the six States in the period 1925 to 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.132" offset="2628441">When the Boulder Canyon Project Act came before Congress for the fourth time to suing Johnsonville, in 1928, to authorize the construction of what is now known as Hoover Dam and the all-American canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.159" offset="2680581">The Senators of the Upper Basin States insisted that there be incorporated in it, a provision that if six States only should ratify, then in that event, the State of California should enact this Limitation Act, limiting her right in the Colorado River, so that, as they put it, if Arizona stayed out, and California took all of the water apportioned to the Lower Basin by the Compact, Arizona in that event might appropriate free of the Compact in the Upper Basin with all the water twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.164" offset="2808581">Limitation Act was imposed upon us or the protection of the upper States.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.263" offset="2828957">That Act was enacted by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.738" offset="2838883">The Project Act provided that at the end of six months, the president of the United States should proclaim either one alternative or the other to have been accomplished either seven-State ratification or six-State ratification plus the Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.160" offset="2892591">And in that event and that event only, should the Project Act go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.575" offset="2918296">Now, we say that the Limitation Act limiting our rights which came into existence as a compliment of a six State Compact and in consequence of Arizona's rejection of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.025" offset="2976078">And the seven-States Compact are mutually exclusive covenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.624" offset="2994469">The Limitation Act was required of us if there were six-State Compact, it was not required if there was seven-State Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.797" offset="3023099">Arizona here sues upon both.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.489" offset="3037936">She says that she ratified the Colorado River Compact in 1944, 15 years after the expiration of the six months period to which I referred but that -- she not only as a party to the seven-State Compact but that she may hold California to the limitations upon us imposed by the Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.773" offset="3122991">Now the Limitation Act provides in terms as to the Project Act that this agreement between California and the United States was for the expressed benefit of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.516" offset="3194044">And consequently, we say that we are liable upon one or the other of these agreements, not both but that the four States of the upper division are necessary parties here to the determination of which shall control.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.551" offset="3254126">They are the expressed joint beneficiaries of the Limitation Act if Arizona sues upon it, they must be joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.807" offset="3283174">They are the parties to the seven-State Colorado River Compact which if it exists at all, replace the Limitation Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="838.298" offset="3353182">We question -- we -- we say at our pleadings that Arizona did not effectively ratify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.826" offset="3375229">We say that for several reasons, first, to the exploration of the 15-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.279" offset="3397068">Second, the fact that there has never been a presidential proclamation of a seven-State Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.880" offset="3415458">There was a proclamation in 29 that seven States had failed to ratify, six States had, and for other reasons but the primary one is it by the time Arizona ratified or purported to in 1944 should already brought to this Court three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.569" offset="3482227">The Colorado River Compact in one form or another had laid before the Court interpretations of it which in the first case, in 1931, happened to coincide almost precisely with our own and said for that reason she wanted no part of it and rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.797" offset="3547115">And that consequently, the California projects, which I'll mention in a moment, had gone ahead with expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars, literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.910" offset="3579611">In the development of their works based upon water rights as set forth in the Compact, as everyone understood it, when -- when Arizona ratified if she did it all in 1944, she did so with announced interpretations that they are the diametric reverse of that and which she attempts to establish in his suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.971" offset="3655784">But we say that if the Compact did become a seven-State Compact in 1944, then as to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.282" offset="3685042">Our obligations upon the Limitation Act are ended but she is one of six joint beneficiaries and we cannot, we think, proceed safely without the presence of the four upper States as other joint beneficiaries to be bound by that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.350" offset="3753378">Now, the Compact itself, which I'll -- these terms I'll come shortly, was -- came into existence in this way in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.318" offset="3793189">The Colorado River arises in the -- the Colorado, extends for some 1700 miles through the straits of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, the Long Arizona, Nevada border, the Arizona-California border, and finally, into the Gulf of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.400" offset="3885558">In its lower regions and in the -- just before leaving the United States, it travels along the realm of the Imperial Valley, an area of the center is below sea level, 270 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.680" offset="3938638">This valley was an imminent and continually endanger of destruction by floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.066" offset="3956193">The river broke in 1905 and was shutoff with great difficulty in 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.293" offset="3977091">There was urgent and growing need for a flood control dam upon the lower river.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.424" offset="3997675">That was objected to by the upper States because of their fear that the doctrine of priority of appropriation, irrespective of Stateline which was proclaimed by this Court in Wyoming versus Colorado while the Compact was being negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.754" offset="4062981">We had it make it possible for the lower States to appropriate all of the stored flood waters as they have therefore -- theretofore appropriated all of the natural flow and expand their uses to such a degree that the junior appropriations in the Upper Basin might never expand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.085" offset="4128287">They wanted a reservation, a protection against the law priority of appropriation before this dam should be authorized, and that was obtained in the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.530" offset="4174054">Now, the Compact, as signed in 1922 provides this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.130" offset="4200490">It divides the -- defines first the Colorado River System as being a Colorado River and its tributaries within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.702" offset="4238733">And the most significant tributary with respect to this lawsuit is the Gila, which arises in New Mexico, traverses Arizona and empties into the mainstream near Yuma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.662" offset="4290560">The -- it divides the Basin geographically into an Upper Basin and a Lower Basin with a division line passing through Lee Ferry, a point in Northwestern Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.076" offset="4328281">And it divides the States into two groups, an upper division and a lower division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.255" offset="4344999">The upper division comprising the four States we seek to join here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.012" offset="4360046">And as in that shows the basins and the divisions do not coincide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.640" offset="4378540">There's a reason for that which I'll explain in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.582" offset="4390243">The Compact does not purport to impose obligations upon or give rights to any individual State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.700" offset="4422740">What it does do, in Article III (a), is to apportioned in perpetuity to the Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.243" offset="4464953">The beneficial consumptive use of seven and a half million acre-feet per year in perpetuity, which it declare shall include all water necessary to supply any rights which may now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.953" offset="4531722">It is an apportionment of the waters of the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.128" offset="4552411">Article III (b) gives the Lower Basin the right to increase its use by one million acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.846" offset="4583340">Now, those two articles together dispose of the consumptive use of 16 million acres-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.735" offset="4614896">But the Compact recognizes that this is not all the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.387" offset="4633496">At the time of its negotiation, it was thought that there was perhaps four of five million acre-feet more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.888" offset="4655543">We know from later water records that the quantity and excess of the 16 million is less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.587" offset="4682292">Article III (c) directs that if the United States shall make a treaty with Mexico, the Mexican water shall be supplied if possible out of this surplus above the 16 million acre-feet fixed by Article III (a) and III (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.877" offset="4747494">If that surplus is deficient, the two basins will each yield half the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.416" offset="4769646">In Articles III (f) and III (g) provide for conferences after 40 years, that is after October 1, 1963, to apportion this surplus above the requirements of III (a), III (b) and III (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.908" offset="4835579">Now, those provisions all deal with the consumptive use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.648" offset="4858567">There is an addition, a provision, Article III (d) that provides that the four States of the upper division, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, will not deplete the flow of the river at Lee Ferry below an aggregate of 75 million acre-feet in each period of 10 consecutive years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.807" offset="4951144">And Article III (c), to which I referred, adds that the upper division will increase that delivery if necessary to supply one-half of the deficiency of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.126" offset="4992418">Now, that provision deals with a corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.638" offset="5006524">It is a block, an aggregate of wet water to be placed in the river or allowed to flow at Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.866" offset="5035363">It is not an apportionment of consumptive use, 75 million acre-feet delivered at Lee Ferry and used along the stream will not support consumptive uses of 75 million acre-feet in 10 years because upon any theory, the return flow, which goes into Mexico, is not a part of the consumptive use in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.228" offset="5140898">And I emphasize because I'll return to it with a distinction between consumptive use, which is what is apportioned by the Compact and corpus, the guarantee of wet water at Lee Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.799" offset="5199099">There are two -- there a number of questions in -- of Compact interpretation, which are at issue, here in the brief but I shall select two of them because they're controlling in my view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.408" offset="5237551">The first is, what is beneficial consumptive use and second, whether the seven and a half million which is apportioned to the Lower Basin per annum is the water, simply, of the mainstream, or whether it includes the waters of the tributaries, particularly the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.070" offset="5308186">Now, the first question as to what is beneficial consumptive use arises in this way, Arizona asked a declaration from the Court that this expression, which appears only in Articles III (a) and III (b), fixing the rights between basins shall be defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.117" offset="5380389">And the definition she wants is that this means the man-made depletion of the virgin flow of the mainstream, everyone agrees that consumptive use doesn't mean the amount diverted, it's less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.521" offset="5450083">California says that the term has the same meaning in the Colorado River Compact as it is defined in the Boulder Canyon Project Act and in the Mexican Water Treaty and as this Court defined it in Nebraska versus Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.552" offset="5510165">It's defined in the Boulder Canyon Project Act as diversions less returns to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.288" offset="5541094">Now, the difference between the two methods of -- the two definitions are simply this, on Arizona's definition, there would be no accounting, no liability no charge for the use of so-called salvaged water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.036" offset="5604101">That is water which went to the sea in the state of nature or was burned up by evaporation losses or seeped into the sands but which has been salvaged by the activities of man in reclamation projects and dams and put to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.835" offset="5675259">And if that water may be used by the Lower Basin in addition to the seven and a half million apportion of Article III (a) and in addition to the million acre-feet of additional use permitted by Article III (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.985" offset="5739938">There is about a million and a half-acre feet of uses of waters of that category, so-called salvaged water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.589" offset="5778286">Arizona alleges that the difference between the two methods, the two definitions on the Gila alone amounts to about 1 million acre-feet and there is about a half a million additional upon the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.167" offset="5832620">Now, the question therefore is whether the Lower Basin may use all together eight and a half million acre-feet including salvaged water or eight and a half, plus one and half or 10 million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.902" offset="5891553">Now, the question affects the Upper Basin in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.555" offset="5910152">If the Lower Basin is entitled to use the so-called salvaged water, the million and a half acre-feet, without any accounting for it under Articles III (a) and III (b), it, of course, diminishes to that extent the surplus above the 16 million covered by those two articles, it is an invasion, a use of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.534" offset="6006073">A surplus is an undivided common fund in which all seven States have undivided interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.216" offset="6028852">It is a buffer or cushion which protects the Lower Basin and the Upper Basin from the obligation to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.783" offset="6059050">The Mexican water shall come out of it first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.402" offset="6073574">And it protects the upper division from their obligation under Article III (c) to increase their deliveries above 75 million acre-feet in 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.688" offset="6106697">To the extent, the surplus is diminished, all seven States are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.411" offset="6129580">And at page 119 of our brief on exceptions, which is filed on October 20th, appears a table which shows the results.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.827" offset="6219233">Of the application of these two theories to the water supply which was available during the critical quarter century of 1931 -- 1930 to 1954, inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.816" offset="6283180">In the -- these figures are taken from a plate which was included in a report of the Secretary of the Interior upon a proposed Arizona project and which incorporates the Secretary says, the Arizona theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.730" offset="6350890">Tape -- column one, is that furnished by Arizona, which assumes the availability at Lee Ferry of an average of 16,270,000 acre-feet.Columns two and three, revised that by reducing the quantity of Lee Ferry to that shown -- for the critical quarter century of 1930 to 1954 which is 13,650,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.036" offset="6460082">Now, if Arizona's theories apply so that there is no charge for the use of salvaged water, the end result, as shown in the last line on that table, is that there is a deficit in meeting the requirements of the Colorado River Compact plus the treaty with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.917" offset="6539598">And that burden must fall either upon a reduction in the use in the Upper Basin of the seven million and half acre-feet apportioned to them if they make good upon their 75 million acre-feet guarantee or if they don't make good on that guarantee, then upon, we reflected in a diminution of uses in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.657" offset="6630609">The Upper Basin is consequently affected by the definition of the term beneficial of consumptive use, not only as applied in the Upper Basin to measure their rights but as applied in the Lower Basin to measure our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.023" offset="6688078">And as we say, the Arizona complaint is framed upon the theory that there is available to the Lower Basin under the Compact an aggregate of some million and half acre-feet more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.020" offset="6743980">Then we think is there under the meaning of beneficial consumptive use which was the one contemporarily accepted and reported by the Compact negotiators and was submitted by Arizona to this Court in 1931.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.315" offset="6941257">There is no way to interpolate or translate the one method into the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.161" offset="6964558">It rises there in this way to take the Gila River as an example, some 2,400,000 acre-feet flow in measured streams in the Gila area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.627" offset="7018475">That water is converted, burned up, used in Arizona to grow crops and support cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.365" offset="7045433">In the state of nature of that same flow, reaching the mainstream would have been diminished by the long sandy stretches of the Gila Arizona says by at least one million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.959" offset="7087752">That is the matter of conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.088" offset="7096320">Nobody was there to measure it before the White man came.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.901" offset="7107500">But assuming that that is the case, then the difference between the two theories is this, shall the uses upon the Gila be measured only in the amount they diminished the flow at the mainstream or shall they be measure in the quantities of water actually consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.652" offset="7178553">We are required in California by the expressed terms of the Boulder Canyon Project Act to measure our uses as diversions less returns to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.648" offset="7218573">It makes no difference what in the state of nature might have reach the Mexican border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.421" offset="7233620">We are charged with diversions less returns to the river, the more rigorous of these two methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.244" offset="7256921">The Mexican Water Treaty provides for a reduction in the deliveries of a million and half acre-feet guarantee to Mexico in the proportion that the consumptive uses in the United States are diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.873" offset="7303419">And the Treaty defines consumptive use just as we defined it and as the Court did in Nebraska versus Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.027" offset="7332049">The substitution of the depletion theory for the actual consumptive use measurement, what as I say, result in a difference of a million and half acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.491" offset="7373949">Now, the second question here is whether the Compact apportions to the Lower Basin seven and a half million acre-feet from the mainstream or apportions that quantity from the Colorado River System including the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.243" offset="7452944">That was the specific issue upon which Arizona's legislature rejected the Compact in 1923, and upon which Arizona brought suit in this Court in 1931 to set the Compact aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.031" offset="7508114">Article II (a) defines the Colorado River System as including the tributaries as well as the mainstream and Article III (a) apportions the waters of the system, and it directs that there shall be included in this apportionment all rights then existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.473" offset="7569868">Now, the rights on the Gila are the oldest that Arizona has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.811" offset="7591184">They've been in -- in existence since 1870 with their bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.727" offset="7606857">Now, if the uses on the Gila are two million acre-feet, as we say they are, and if the Lower Basin has apportions of seven and half million acre-feet of consumptive use, then we have left, out at the mainstream in the Lower Basin, for division in this decree, approximately five and a half million acre-feet under Article III (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.851" offset="7703301">If Arizona's method of measuring consumptive use were sustained and the uses on the Gila were valued at only about one million acre-feet, then they may be divided by the decree in this case on the mainstream under Article III (a), apportioned in perpetuity, only six and half million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.277" offset="7781042">But Arizona here seeks to quiet title in the Lower Basin to seven and a half million acre-feet of water from the mainstream and she must do that in order to sustain the figure that she wishes quieted in herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.986" offset="7839869">Let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.529" offset="7850109">She claims from the mainstream the specific figure of 2,800,000 acre-feet under Article III (a), apportioned in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.445" offset="7885740">The Compact doesn't make that apportionment to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.888" offset="7895458">It makes no apportionment to any State individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.234" offset="7908833">But she says that the rights of California were fixed by the Limitation Act in -- in III (a) water at 4,400,000 acre-feet per annum, which they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.819" offset="7951256">And the 300,000 acre-feet is a fair allocation to Nevada and what is left after deducting 4,400,000 for California and 300,000 for Nevada from seven and a half million in the mainstream is 2,800,000 acre-feet for herself of waters apportioned by Article III (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.427" offset="8037669">And she says she holds a contract with the Secretary of Interior made in 1944 which she does, which authorizes the delivery in Arizona from the mainstream of 2,800,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.121" offset="8088451">Now, that contract, which she pleads, is the next as one of her exhibits, recites on its face that it does not declare what part of the 2,800,000 acre feet covered by that agreement is apportion of Article III (a), how much is covered of Article III (b) nor how much the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.039" offset="8156056">But Arizona says that her right to the waters apportioned and perpetuity from the mainstream of Article III (a) is 2,800,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.436" offset="8197642">And she arrives with that only upon the assumption that the Lower Basin may claim from the mainstream, seven and half million acre-feet, without deduction for any uses upon the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.562" offset="8254171">Now, she gets rid the Gila River by identifying it with Article III (b), which says that the Lower Basin may increase its uses by one million acre-feet per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.563" offset="8302237">And not withstanding the fact that the uses on the Gila are the oldest she has, she identifies him with his increment of additional new uses permitted by Article III (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.889" offset="8339540">And the reason she says is that the negotiators of the seven States of Sta. Fe, in 1922 agreed that Arizona should have that million acre-feet and that it should be identified with the Gila River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.002" offset="8391993">Now, that is a testimony which she wanted to perpetuate in their suit here in 1934, the testimony of the negotiators, and the Court rejected it, telling it would never become admissible, that it was in flat contradiction of the terms of the Compact among other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.387" offset="8457509">Nevertheless, she annexes to her pleadings here, the ex parte statements of one of her negotiators and of others to -- to identify, make that same identification of the Gila with Article III (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.576" offset="8514247">Now, what this all comes to is this, Arizona says that the seven and half million apportion of Article III (a) is identical with the 75 million acre-feet guaranteed by the States of the upper division at Lee Ferry each decade, that one is simply 10 times the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.374" offset="8597420">Now, there are many reason why that cannot be so, either physically or legally, and they were spelled out for the Court clearly by Mr. Dean Acheson, then counsel for Arizona in the 1931 case in which he showed, I think, to the satisfaction of all of the States, that the 75 million acre-feet guaranteed at Lee Ferry includes two components, the water required to sustain the uses on the mainstream in the United States below Lee Ferry and water from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.859" offset="8727406">Whereas the seven and half million apportioned by Article III (a) in perpetuity of consumptive use includes two components, but not the same two, uses on the mainstream plus the uses on the Gila and the tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.685" offset="8782681">In other words, the 75 million acre-feet includes some water from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.286" offset="8809117">Now, heretofore, so far as I know, the States of the upper division have not yielded from their position that if they deliver 75 million acre-feet in every decade at Lee Ferry, they're entitled to credit for some deliveries to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.160" offset="8880588">The effect of Arizona's contention, if the decree were issued as she wishes it, would be the quiet title in perpetuity to -- in favor of the Lower Basin to all of that 75 million acre-feet guaranteed by III (d) as though apportioned to the Lower Basin and containing no water available for delivery to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.644" offset="8974524">Now, consequently the four Upper States are surely affected by the issue of whether they must deliver at Lee Ferry every decade, 75 million acre-feet, including the water from Mexico, or 75 million plus water from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.430" offset="9045682">The claim of Arizona that all are 2,800,000 acre-feet can be taken from the mainstream as absolutely central to her case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.209" offset="9080790">She says she must quiet title to that quantity under Article III (a) in perpetuity to finance the projects that she wants to build.She can't do it unless she first establishes to your satisfaction that the three States of Arizona, California and Nevada have a right to the 75 million acre feet at Lee Ferry as apportioned to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.286" offset="9165113">That is the submerged foundation of Arizona suit, the right to the 75 million acre-feet, the right to seven and half million acre-feet, all from the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.080" offset="9220284">And we say that that -- a decree based upon that assumption would be based upon an allusion directly contrary to the terms of the Compact and that a decree so based would leave this controversy in the language of Shields versus Barrow in such conditions as to be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.346" offset="9301368">We would be confronted by a decree, quiet in title in Arizona to 2,800,000 acre-feet upon the assumption that the three States of Arizona, California and Nevada owned seven and half million acre-feet in the mainstream under Article III (a), whereas the four absent States are free at a later time to say “that is not so”, that the three lower States had available for division only five and half million or six and half million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.495" offset="9409933">And this is a suit to quiet title in perpetuity to the rights derived from this inter basin Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.238" offset="9448908">Now, I desire to refer briefly to the question I mentioned earlier as to whether Arizona has effectively ratified the Compact, and if so, whether California is released from the -- her obligation under the Limitation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.564" offset="9550158">We say it is a grossly inequitable position for Arizona to hold California in 1944 or 1955 to a result that she could not have obtained by timely ratification of the Compact in 1929, namely, to our Limitation Act, enacted only on condition that seven States did not ratify and then by delay having the advantage of that plus whatever rights she claims here under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.302" offset="9653185">If this were a -- involved only Arizona and California, if this -- if this covenant run only to -- to Arizona, we might safely ask the Court to rule that if Arizona ratified in 1944, we're -- we are released from that covenant, the Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.406" offset="9721522">It is a covenant which runs jointly, the six States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.154" offset="9732598">Arizona is one of them, one of the six joint obligees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.304" offset="9749211">Consequently, we think it essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.135" offset="9764467">It is axiomatic that if one of several joint obligees or joint beneficiaries sues upon an agreement, he must join -- join the obligees for the very reason involved here, to protect the obligor against later harassment by suits by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.441" offset="9829669">Now, the Special Master, upon that, held that the upper States weren't affected one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.740" offset="9854955">That they couldn't sue on this California Limitation Act, I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.942" offset="9879719">And that they were not interested in whether Arizona was or was not a party to the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.117" offset="9908454">Now, Arizona alleges a breach of the Limitation Act by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.553" offset="9922142">We deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.733" offset="9926844">But if there is a breach, the breach alleged is that we claim more water than we're entitled to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.862" offset="10487432">It is in Section 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.772" offset="10495060">Section 4 (a) provides that the Boulder Canyon Project Act shall not take effect unless either, one, the seven States ratify the Compact and the present so proclaims or after six months failing seven-State ratification, if six States ratify and California enacts the Limitation Act which I referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.968" offset="10587847">Now, when I refer to the 4,400,000 acre-feet, let me say that the Limitation Act and the Project Act both provide that California may have an addition of that 4,400,00 acre-feet, one-half of the excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.237" offset="10664856">That Limitation was a very severe restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.123" offset="10676454">California pleads that we have present perfected rights in 1929, that this projects built using water which had rights to the extent of 4,950,000 acre-feet and that we have valid appropriations of six million acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.271" offset="10749074">Now, I should like to come to the claims of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.090" offset="10768300">So far, I have dealt with those of the States and I've tried to demonstrate that Arizona's quiet title action could not be sustained here except upon interpretation of the Compact which assume obligations in the four upper States much greater than they have ever heretofore admitted, greater than we believe exist and that a decree based upon those assumption would be advisory and an allusion, unless they are bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.640" offset="10874462">The claims of the United States are in a -- quiet a different category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.153" offset="10892539">The 12 million acre-feet, United States claims here, falls into four groupings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.764" offset="10918975">And the question is whether these are claims against the waters of the entire system and against all seven States, or whether as the Special Master found their claims against only the waters of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.202" offset="10976758">Of the principal -- the four principal categories are as follows, first, the Government claims water to serve its treaty with Mexico in amount of 1,500,000 acre-feet measured up to boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.471" offset="11029838">Article 10 of the treaty expressly guarantees this delivery and I quote “from any and all sources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.793" offset="11063171">It is a systemwide obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.608" offset="11082397">Now, recall that Article III (c) of the Compact provides that the -- this water from Mexico shall come out of the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.237" offset="11112908">And if this surplus is deficient, the Upper Basin States must supply half of the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.145" offset="11136522">Certainly, it would be impossible for this Court to find that Arizona, California and Nevada must yield the water to supply the Mexican Water Treaty and it would be impossible for the Court without these four Upper States present to decide what proportion of it they must yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.851" offset="11203396">Because the quantity that each of the two basins must yield from its own consumptive uses is fixed by the quantity of the surplus which is to first bear of the Mexican burden and the quantity of the surplus in turn depends upon whether Arizona and the Lower Basin States can or cannot use the million and a half acre-feet of it without any accounting as salvaged water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.885" offset="11319484">The second category that the Government claims for is for Indians in Arizona and California, a million and three quarters acre-feet of diversion rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.940" offset="11371729">It alleges that the rights of the Indians to the use of water are in no way subject to or affected by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.953" offset="11407778">And it specifically denies that the Indian uses are to be charged to the basin and to the State in which they're located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.264" offset="11441006">The Government's Indian claims are therefore claims against the waters of the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.086" offset="11468278">They existed before the Compact did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.168" offset="11480607">The Compact relates that these Indian claims are unaffected by it and the Government we know intends to assert that these Indian claims are therefore waters which are claims against the entire system independent of, ahead of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.246" offset="11548944">We will resist that claim with a proper time, but the United States and its motion here for a determination of certain legal issues including that one, I told you on October 20th that if the Indian claims are held to be against the river, as distinguished from the Lower Basin, as defined by the Colorado River Compact, that conclusion would have far reaching effect upon the interest of all the States to the Colorado stream system and it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.430" offset="11661688">Now, the issue where the water for the Indians is to come from is in the case, its here now, this is not an additional issue.And that issue must be decided, it requires a joinder of the absent States to whom we share that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.504" offset="11721979">Now, the third category puts United States claims water as to serve the contracts that -- that it has made under the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.763" offset="11754998">These aggregate about eight and a half million acre-feet, they are to be supplied from storage at Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.333" offset="11781329">This quantity, the Government -- the Government alleges that all of these contracts were valid and binding obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.173" offset="11804630">All three of these States now here rely upon such contracts, Arizona, California and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.955" offset="11831798">Now, the eight and a half million acre-feet covered by these contracts manifestly must include some surplus because Arizona conceives that she uses on the Gila River one million acre-feet, we says it's two million, so that in any event, the water contracts, Lake Mead, include from one to two million acre-feet of surplus beyond the aggregate of the quantity specified by Articles III (a) and III (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.063" offset="11940153">And the question here, which is one of the gravest in the whole case, is whether the United States by the construction of Hoover Dam and the impounding of the waters there has appropriated the unappropriated surplus waters of the Colorado River System, and may dispose of them by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.036" offset="12020088">That is different from the problem that confronted the Court in Nebraska versus Wyoming, or Kansas versus Colorado, or the other cases in which United States asserted the ownership of unappropriated waters flowing in the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.641" offset="12074527">Here, the problem is whether, by the construction of works, an aid of navigation, the impounding of the water behind the dam, the United States has acquired title if it did not have it before to the waters that salvaged and stored there and may dispose of them by its own contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.399" offset="12145580">And that is one of the grave issues of the case, did or did not the United States appropriate the unappropriated waters of the Colorado River System, the surplus waters and may disposed of them by contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.588" offset="12466260">We think the United States, by the assertion of claims of 12 million acre-feet, 50% more than the -- is awarded to the Lower Basin by Article III (a) and III (b) combined, necessarily in larger scope of the -- of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.022" offset="12520072">And that is quite an addition, I might say, to the unspecified claims for flood control and navigation, that to which I come next.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.478" offset="12557897">The 12 million acre-feet, to be precise, 11,785,000 that the Government claims for specified rights here, is an addition to the claim it makes for the right to utilize the full capacity of the diversion, the carriage and storage structures describe in its petition for flood control navigation and other federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.474" offset="12661864">Now, what that mean is this, that the Government claims the right to discharge water from Hoover Dam to make room for an expected flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.743" offset="12706900">To waste that water to the sea, and of course, it has that right, under the terms of the Project Act which directs that the reservoir shall be used first for navigation and flood control, second, for river regulation and third, for the satisfaction of present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.426" offset="12773669">Now, when the United States claims the right to discharge precipitably millions of acre-feet from Hoover Dam to the Gulf of California destroy any opportunity for its consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.051" offset="12828108">How can it be said that the interest of the United States in this proceeding is confined to the rights relating to waters of the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.972" offset="12859873">Those rights fixed by the Compact are rights to beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.256" offset="12877009">This is a right asserted by the United States to destroy water in needs of flood control and deprive anybody with right to its consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.277" offset="12913058">Now, these are asserted as paramount rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.511" offset="12926015">The Government doesn't use that word, but that's what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.622" offset="12942420">And in this action, the United States and these States don't appear here as equals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.191" offset="12960705">If these are paramount rights of the United States to release the water for flood control that we had anticipated a right to use for consumptive use in these States, it's a right superior to any of ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.087" offset="13012323">And they -- this Court held in the first of these cases, in 1931, that the United States may exercise its constitutional functions without regard to the police regulations of any State, Arizona in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.617" offset="13062374">And if that's true, then no consort of States and an interstate Compact may acquire for themselves in any insulation against those Government powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.439" offset="13277727">But that if the Congress should find otherwise, the Compact should still be regarded as binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.180" offset="13304686">Congress did find it otherwise in Sections 1 of the Project Act that directed that the Dam be built in aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.895" offset="13335510">And in Section 6, directed that the waters be used for navigation and flood control and in the first of these cases, in 1931, the constitutionality of that Act and the validity of the construction of Hoover Dam were sustained upon the navigation power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.722" offset="13410847">Now, these are not, as I say claims against Arizona, California and Nevada, these are claims for federal purposes with respect to which all seven States were on an equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.042" offset="13460167">The United States asked an adjudication of its rights, and the fact that it didn't name these four upper States, as a matter of fact, it didn't name Nevada either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.978" offset="13543863">Now, the Special Master has found that Utah and New Mexico are necessary parties here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.040" offset="14116153">There can be no doubt at all that if this were a suit among none sovereign parties, presenting the same issues that are before the Court, the joinder of the absent parties would have to be ordered for the reasons I stated at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.045" offset="14188147">But the Special Master asserts, without being explicit why, that joinder rules are different as to sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.205" offset="14236735">We think that a reading of the interstate cases will show that the significant difference in the handling of sovereigns and original actions here and the handling of private litigants is this, that the Court has shown significant concern for the protection of sovereigns as defenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.098" offset="14328372">It has required a plaintiff that they prove an original action to their cases by a stricter burden of proof than if private defendants were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.998" offset="14375915">The Court has been reluctant to grant relief against a sovereign defendant except if were required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.670" offset="14402664">California, as a sovereign defendant, is entitled to benefits of that principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.606" offset="14462328">But the rules of joinder do not conflict with that principle in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.961" offset="14479778">The rules of joinder are designed to protect defendants through litigation that will either be futile or grossly unfair because other parties whose rights and obligations are involved are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.243" offset="14540904">And as a defendant, both against the claims of Arizona and as against the claims of the United States, California, certainly no less than a non-sovereign party is entitled to invoke these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.928" offset="14595657">The great practical question which are a joinder motion raises can be simply stated, can this Court decide both effectively and fairly as to the present parties, how their rights to the use of waters of the Colorado River System should be divided without deciding how large those rights are in the aggregate as against the parties whom we seek to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.817" offset="14723239">Arizona answered this question in her complaint when she expressly asked for interpretations of the Compact, the inter-basin agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4578.762" offset="18314971">Much has been said by Brother Ely, representing the State of California, covering grounds which was not necessary for us to again cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.312" offset="18369202">This is one of the most important cases, I believe, dealing with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.015" offset="18412042">Water administered under the western water law of appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.928" offset="18439628">It is the first time, I believe, that a case of this magnitude has reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.434" offset="18477662">It covers sufficient ground of warrant the court in saying that there is not a single solitary question pertaining to western water law which is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.733" offset="18554880">It seems to me that this Court has well stated the problem with respect to an interstate creed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.625" offset="18586436">In the case of State of New Jersey versus the State of New York as reported in 283 U.S.336.</text>

            <text syncTime="4735.059" offset="18940134">I make that statement for this purpose that there is no need of seeking another formula or else just a necessity of this Court drafting a formula, it has already been adapted by seven sovereign States of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.762" offset="19022994">It is true, one of those states withheld some 15 years its right to ratification, but today, it is before this Court.</text>
