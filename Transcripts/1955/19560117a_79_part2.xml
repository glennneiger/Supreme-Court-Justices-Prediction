          <heading>Argument of John K. Skaggs, Jr.</heading>

            <label>Mr. John K. Skaggs, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">As to the right of the respondent in this case to litigate in the unfair labor practice proceeding, the question of whether or not Mr. Taylor, Regional Director, was as a matter of law, a -- an officer of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.248" offset="132911">The first time that this Court looked at a situation similar to that was in the Highland Park case, where the question of judicial review of the compliance of a union under Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act was a judge to be proper subject of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.204" offset="244715">It was only natural at following that the various Courts of Appeal would look at that question and that a great many other matters might be presented to the courts for their consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.080" offset="320261">In the case of the N. L. R. B. versus Sharples Chemical Company from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, it was there held that the veracity of a non-Communist affidavit filed by an officer, shall we say a constitutional officer, as defined by the N.L.R.B might not be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.990" offset="435931">We have no quarrel with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.452" offset="445753">We believe that the N. L. R. B. should be able to judge and determine the veracity of such affidavits as are filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.354" offset="489326">Again, in the N. L. R. B. versus the Vulcan Manufacturing case, the issue of the truthfulness of the affidavits rights or whether the ostensible officers filing them are, in fact, searched by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.304" offset="613146">We made no question but that a party to an unfair labor practice proceeding or representative proceeding does not have the right to question the truthfulness of the affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.066" offset="664242">Then, in American Rubber Products Corporation against N. L. R. B. from the Seventh Circuit, again, we find that the Court notes the distinction between the fact of compliance which it holds is not subject to litigation, and again, distinguishes a necessity of compliance as a matter alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.924" offset="803631">Then, we come to the two most recent decisions, the case that we have here which is on review from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and a more subsequent case of the Goodman Manufacturing Company case against N. L. R. B. which is decided most recently in the -- in November of this past year and I'm unable to furnish a good citation on that case, where the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals pinpointed and distinguished all these cases, again reiterating that whether or not a person is an officer and incidentally the Goodman case went off directly on that point is subject to judicial review because again, the definition of the term officer becomes the whole keystone of Section 9 (h) of the Act upon which depends all of the ability of our country to control Communist infiltrations into unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.975" offset="1131833">At least, that may be given under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.007" offset="1159941">And with that before us, it seems clear that the respondent in this case must turn its consideration to the question of is the constitutional test set up by the N. L. R. B. not a reasonable test because we do not think that but we do not think it is a reasonable test, we do not think that a reasonable test is adequate to supply the demand of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.886" offset="1323468">For among other reasons, that the Board, in its brief here, clearly points out, and I refer you to page 50 of the -- 50 to 55 -- wait a minute, that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.818" offset="1415210">I'll have that in just a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.121" offset="2640457">-- not considered that phrase of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.404" offset="2657593">We have turned in our consideration here to the fact that the Board places a question and it urges that its constitutional test, that is who are named by the unions by laws or rather its Constitution, is consistent with the ordinary and usual meaning of the term "officers."</text>
            <text syncTime="696.547" offset="2786116">Now, that I do not believe if the definition that may well be given to that and was on page 50 of the Board's brief that I referred to that it admits that there is no special connotation to be given to the term "officer" as it used in the labor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.891" offset="2871484">And that accordingly, since it places the question on that level, I believe, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in -- in answer to your question, there -- it becomes no occasion for any judicial deference to be given to the Board's definition of the constitutional test since it does place it strictly on that level and does not purport to attach to it any special significance as being used in a labor statute or in any special significance because the N. L. R. B., as a Board constituted under the Act, has so defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.660" offset="3058625">Our basis for that is when the words are used in their ordinary meaning, their construction presents solely a question of law and an issue fully appropriate for the exercise of -- I -- we believe the widest scope of -- of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.929" offset="3135634">And our authority for that decision is, of course, the Great Northern Railway against the Merchants' Elevator Company case which was found in 259 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.454" offset="3189760">And when this Court has then found that Congress used language in Section 9 (h) in its ordinary and accepted sense which is, of course, the holding in the Highland Park case, then it seems to us, as the respondent, that the ruling in the Highland Park -- Park case is inescapable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.695" offset="3322776">And that the Court judicially must need to review the question of officer and the proper definition of the term “officer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.761" offset="3387037">And it is our contention that the term “officer” should be held to include all persons who are occupying pulls of leadership in unions whose duties, responsibilities, and influence in the union measure up to those as an officer as that term is usually and ordinarily understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.512" offset="3513992">Now, I realize that that is a broad definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.383" offset="3533531">I further confess to a lack of knowledge of the union hierarchy that permits me to be more definite in such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.276" offset="3601032">But, as I said at the outset here, it is not the purpose of the respondent to in anywise seek to hamper the operations of the N. L .R. B as an administrative board, rather, we seek to have them take a real functional view of the term “officer” as it is used to conduct real ex parte hearings into the persons who constitute those unions, who make their policies, are responsible for their decisions, their actions, before it's pointed out in Judge Parker in the lower court the same decision in the Highland Park Case is far more important that those officers, that the officers of national and international union be required to file these affidavits than it is for the ones at the lower level.</text>
