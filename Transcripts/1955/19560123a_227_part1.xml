            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="24.081" offset="96235">If the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.925" offset="111700">The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld an injunction issued by the District Court to the Ninth Judicial District of Rapides Parish which enjoined peaceful picketing in a primary strike for recognition picketing only by the employees of the Arkansas Oak Flooring company.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.840" offset="259344">And the basis for the issuance of the injunction was that the United Mine Workers of America was not recognized by the National Labor Relations Board that it had not filed the financial reports required by Section 9 (f) and had not filed the non-communist affidavit required by Section 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="103.233" offset="412839">The facts out of which the litigation arose are exceedingly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.838" offset="451291">They're these the Arkansas Flooring Company was engaged in manufacturing oak flooring.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.068" offset="488176">It had a principal office in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and a plant in Alexandria, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.425" offset="517642">They bought some of their lumber in Texas, 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.525" offset="542093">They shipped 90% of the finished product in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.148" offset="568529">It was admitted during the trial that they were engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.902" offset="603533">The Arkansas Flooring Company had been in business for about 25 years, but the four years preceding the trial date they had not had a union at the plant in Alexandria.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.834" offset="671242">Along in November and December of 1953, a representative of the District 50 United Mine Workers of America came to Alexandria, organized the employees and got membership cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.993" offset="755879">The employees in the plant number 225, membership cards were signed by a 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.253" offset="808960">The union was organized, stewards were elected and they asked this representative of the United Mine Workers to go to the plant manager and ask for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.263" offset="876983">He went to a Mr. Fowler who was in charge of the plant at that time, the man over him was away.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.694" offset="922749">He stated we represent the majority of your employees and we want recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.956" offset="971755">The manager of the -- he showed the manager of the plan his credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.426" offset="997669">The man looked at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.477" offset="1001848">Mr. Fowler looked at him enough to see that he represented the United Mine Workers of America, District 50.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="259.858" offset="1039360">Well Mr. Harris, what does the allegation mean in the petition here that this was done in the absence of their selection of the union as their representative?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.320" offset="1069244">Didn't they allege that in their petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="270.231" offset="1080842">If they had a 174 out of 222, I would have thought they would have selected their representative.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="275.790" stopTime="321.350">
            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="275.790" offset="1103099">Well, I don't know why they put that allegation in because it is definitely contrary to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.233" offset="1140924">The undisputed evidence shows 174 cards had been signed by employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.180" offset="1176660">At the time of the trial a 179 had been signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.751" offset="1198916">So the facts of -- that developed on the trial and those cards, two of them are in the record, a blank card and a signed card showing that a 179 men out of 225 had signed asking District 50 to represent --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="321.350" offset="1285329">But if they hadn't been able to show that there'd been a majority or a substantial number, that the case would have been somewhat different, would it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.488" offset="1313855">If they went before a (Inaudible) to be recognized without having 174 as they allege here in their petition, you get a different case --</text>

            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="335.238" offset="1340918">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.466" offset="1341858">I think it'd be a very different case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="337.226" stopTime="339.334">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="337.226" offset="1348859">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="339.334" stopTime="362.599">
            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="339.334" offset="1357322">But I think when they do represent a majority and they go to the man and he does not check to see it they have a majority, he said you, the national -- you are not recognized by the National Labor Relation Board and I don't recognize you either.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="362.599" stopTime="388.188">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="362.599" offset="1450318">But it might make a difference as to the jurisdiction that the National Labor Relations Board might have if there's an allegation then that they had not been selected instead of they hadn't selected their representative, might have a bearing on the jurisdiction, the National Labor Relation Board in a proceeding that is brought before them as to whether they were striking or picketing on behalf of a selected representative or picketing on behalf of one had not been selected as they allege here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="crampton_harris" startTime="388.188" stopTime="664.523">
            <label>Mr. Crampton Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="388.188" offset="1552718">But under the language of the Weber case, if despite that allegation on the trial the facts show that there is a majority then it became the duty of the trial court to define to go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.794" offset="1647073">It -- it might be that the allegation saved the petition from being dismissed on its face without taking evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.446" offset="1693780">But when they go ahead and take evidence and that evidence shows that they did represent a majority then as we understand the Weber case it became the duty of the state court to abandon the proceeding because the policy of the National Labor Relations Act is to encourage collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.678" offset="1794612">The first -- the last paragraph of the first section of the Act gives the employees full freedom of choice of the designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.084" offset="1856261">It uses full freedom of association and of designation of their representative for purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.347" offset="1893355">Then Section 7 of the Act makes it a protected right for them to engage in collective bargaining through a representative of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.871" offset="1959393">We see that under the undisputed facts that developed on the trial the strike was an activity protected by Section 13 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.511" offset="2033998">So we have a declaration of policy, we have a method of designation that is recognized and been practiced in America, the card system, the man didn't agree to check the cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.605" offset="2114351">He said you are not recognized by the National Labor Relations Board and I don't recognize you either.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.143" offset="2148519">And the representative said, we want to talk to you about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.578" offset="2170253">He said, "Not to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.656" offset="2182583">Not to me."</text>
            <text syncTime="546.517" offset="2186031">Then at that point there's a slight dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.952" offset="2199719">The representative said -- he told us to go -- do whatever we pleased, the words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.342" offset="2221349">The manager said, I told him to get in touch with Pine Bluff.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.551" offset="2242142">He was not positive as to whether he told him to call Mr. Nesbit or Mr. Smith in Pine Bluff.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.718" offset="2278818">The reasoning of the Arkansas, I mean of the Louisiana Supreme Court was this that you have not been certified and since you have not been certified a strike by a union that hasn't complied with 9 (f), (g) and (h) is a strike for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.941" offset="2383726">He said you can't be certified under Labor Management Relations Act because you haven't filed the reports and the affidavit and since you haven't been certified and can't be certified, you cannot compel recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.994" offset="2471915">And that particular -- it seems to us that the decisions almost unanimously hold that full freedom of designation allows the employees engaged in interstate commerce to designate any man they please, in any way they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.788" offset="2571076">And under the decision in Hill against Florida, if the right of the employees is full, they have freedom of choice then their freedom of choice connotes or implies a freedom of acceptance.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.816" offset="3279203">The -- it wasn't the ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.478" offset="3289861">We understand the law to require certification by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.294" offset="3317133">Certification has never been made a condition precedent to representation so far as we understand the vast majority or the vast weight of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.970" offset="3367811">It is a matter that if they have full freedom of designation, they can designate them by cards or they could use any other method.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.739" offset="3410860">And if they have full freedom of choice then their freedom of choice implies a freedom of acceptance, a right to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.060" offset="3456209">So that we say that what the Supreme Court of Louisiana did, they trespassed upon a complex system established by the Federal Government that they misconstrued the effect of the decisions of this Court and the effect of the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeal that they seem to imply absent certification, your effort to get recognition by a strike is an unlawful object.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.970" offset="3631856">Well, if the right to strike a majority representation is protected by Section 13 and the right of majority selection is given by Section 8, then under the Act the strike was not for an unlawful object.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.429" offset="3709701">It was for a lawful object.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.576" offset="3722240">And the fact that he could not the District 50 couldn't go to the board and get certified, didn't deprive District 50 of the ancient methods of self-help, economic pressures and they did not in any way trespassed upon any case that involves a fault in the manner of picketing or a defect or vice in the objective picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.243" offset="3888901">The manner of picketing in this case was absurdly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.581" offset="3910322">There were only three pickets at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.964" offset="3923801">The only pickets were employees of the company, they had two signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.279" offset="3953058">One said this plant is on strike, the other said, we want recognition District 50 UW8.</text>
