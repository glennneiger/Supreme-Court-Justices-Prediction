            <label>Mr. Orrin G. Judd</label>
            <text syncTime="9.348" offset="37303">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.916" offset="51618">I want to address myself to four phases of the case and presenting it to you this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.942" offset="75755">First, the language of the statute, second, its legislative history, third, its judicial and administrative construction, and fourth, the fact that it is a reasonable protection of naturalized citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.398" offset="137509">I believe all these considerations will support the construction adopted by the courts below with an affidavit showing good cause is a necessary part of a complaint for denaturalization of a naturalized citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.016" offset="196023">I just want to point out in the beginning, this -- what the Court well knows that this is a serious matter for a defendant jeopardizing his hard won citizenship, the treasure which is the most precious thing that he possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.468" offset="257776">The language of the Act of 1906 recognizes this in setting forth the procedure for denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.493" offset="289959">We consider the affidavit to be one of three procedural requirements, all set forth in the same section and two of them in the same sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.054" offset="332173">I have quoted on page 4 of our brief the 1906 statute because the parties, I think both agree that no change in language from the 1906 statute has been intended to make any change in construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.449" offset="413780">The 1906 statute provides, "That it shall be the duty of the United States Attorneys for the respective Districts upon affidavit showing good cause therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.536" offset="454113">To institute proceedings in any court having jurisdiction of naturalized aliens in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit."</text>
            <text syncTime="124.263" offset="496953">The second sentence of that same paragraph provides, "That any such proceedings, the party holding the Certificate of Citizenship alleged to have been fraudulently or illegally procured shall have 60 days personal notice in which to make an answer to the petition of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.536" offset="566126">In other words, there are three requirements in that statute that the proceeding be upon affidavit that it be brought in the district of the defendant's residence and that it be brought on 60 days notice to the defendant instead of the 20 days which are usually given to answer a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.664" offset="662570">The Government says that the first of those three requirements, the requirement of an affidavit is not a condition on the bringing of the action because the United States Attorney has authority to bring actions from his general powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.699" offset="738743">That meets with several difficulties it seems to me in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.718" offset="758805">The Government is quite vague as to where that general power comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.633" offset="778449">There is no other statute referred to which specifically gives the United States Attorney power to bring actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.649" offset="810527">There is a statute which confers the duty on the United States Attorney to prosecute all civil actions in which the United States is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.315" offset="853159">That statute has been on the books since before 1906 and the duty of the District Attorney to bring an action as such stands from that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.642" offset="894537">The provisions, the procedure for the actions stems from the Section 340 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="229.940" offset="919719">If as the Government argues, there are two types of action for the District Attorney, one, where he's compelled by an outsider affidavit to bring the action and another when he brings it under a general power without an affidavit, then it's -- requires a strange construction of the statute to say that the other procedural requirements apply to an action brought under the general power.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.966" offset="1031837">If the U.S. Attorney under some general power can bring an action without an affidavit, where is the statute that says, "Such an action must be brought in the district of the defendant's residence?"</text>

            <text syncTime="810.055" offset="3240124">Well, as I see it, that's the difference between a pleading and an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.776" offset="3255066">The pleading may set forth conclusions, when Congress asks for an affidavit it asks for something which sets forth facts in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.615" offset="3290384">Now, we told that the Court bypassed this question of the meaning of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.906" offset="3311595">I find that the Court quoted the language of the statute three times on pages 12 and 13 of the record in the course its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.841" offset="3343360">And it used some of this reasoning that I have used on page 14 of the opinion where it said, "The fact that Congress inserted these protections referring to venue and the notice, the fact that Congress inserted these requirements for the protection of naturalized citizens in the 1906 Act has been consistent with the Government's position."</text>
            <text syncTime="861.916" offset="3447641">And there's a -- the reason the Court went to the legislative history which I like to pass to now is because there had been a spate of cases in 1953 and 1954 which held the affidavit is not jurisdictional, is not necessary and need not be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.052" offset="3540114">Then the Court naturally wanted to be sure and we wanted to give the Court adequate information when we were briefed here that in following the cases from the appellate court of this -- Appeals Court of the District of Columbia and the Third and Fifth Circuit instead of the dictum in the Schwinn case and the later District Court cases, he was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.155" offset="3636558">The legislative history, it seems to me confirms what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.996" offset="3679922">First, we ought to consider what the situation was in 1906 when the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.003" offset="3703954">It's true that some actions for denaturalization were being brought at that time but the power to bring them was uncertain.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.462" offset="3801757">One case held that a federal court could not offset a decree of naturalization granted in the state court for procedural irregularities in that court since there were questions about the actions of state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.263" offset="3901022">Another case, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that even the federal court dealing with a federal judgment could not offset it for extra defraud where the judgment was regular on its face and the proceeding was an independent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.279" offset="3981061">Somehow in spite of those cases, some courts were -- prevailed upon the grant orders denaturalizing aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.990" offset="4175935">But when you come to the legislative history and we look at the first statute that was -- the first draft of the bill which is set forth on page 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.188" offset="4212715">The original bill as proposed by the Commission on Naturalization on which the Attorney General was represented simply said, "The United States shall have the power to institute proceedings with the purpose of setting aside the Certificate of Citizenship.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.950" offset="4275722">That was to clarify the doubts which existed before to whether such an action could be properly be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.909" offset="4303621">The Committee on Immigration and Naturalization in the House revised that and inserted the requirement of an affidavit so that the draft read, "The United States shall upon affidavit made by any credible person have the power to institute proceedings.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.490" offset="4373943">Now, it's significant that the word "credible person" there was comparable for the words "credible witness" in the naturalization sections that Congress felt there was need for just as great particularity and protection in revoking naturalization as in naturalizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.036" offset="4440085">The requirement of an affidavit as it was set forth in this first statute, or in this draft submitted by the Committee was clearly a qualification, a condition on the existence of the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.093" offset="4500271">The requirement of an affidavit didn't come in with the language of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.310" offset="4521169">The reference to duty came in at later stage, referred to on page 32 of our brief, at the same time as the provision concerning venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.655" offset="4562547">It was proposed by Congressman Bonin who was the floor manager of the bill and the Chairman of a subcommittee, having to do with these sections of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.915" offset="4615628">At that time the word "power" was changed to "duty", a restriction to the venue in the district of residence living out the district where the citizen was naturalized, was introduced and the word "affidavit" made by any credible person was changed to affidavit showing good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.415" offset="4693577">It seems to us hardly likely that what was in the preceding draft a tradition on the exercise of the power was changed to a mere option or means of compulsion by this amendment particularly, when one of the purposes of the amendment was to create additional protection for the defendant by providing limitations on the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.578" offset="4798276">The -- now, there's no statement in Congress to indicate such a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.216" offset="4824816">We've been through the legislative debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.990" offset="4831922">They're analyzed in our brief so that I can fairly say that there is no implicate -- no indication there that a changed from a conditional power to a mere means of compulsion of the District Attorney was explained to Congress as being involved in this amendment which Congressman Bonin proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.055" offset="4924186">We're told by the Government that the District Attorneys were so lax that it was necessary to impose that duty on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.287" offset="4961071">I'm sorry to disagree as to the interpretation of the congressional record but I'm sure that Your Honors will want to analyze it for yourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.456" offset="4997747">But I have found no complaints of laxity on the part of United States Attorneys in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.606" offset="5026377">There are complaints by various Congressmen about the state attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.769" offset="5047066">There are suggestions that United States Attorneys maybe overzealous in taking appeals in naturalization cases in order to prevent people from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.984" offset="5103909">But there is no suggestion that any United States Attorney who has been presented with the case by the Naturalization Service or from any other source had unreasonably refused to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.701" offset="5170782">On the contrary, there were instances in the published reports of overzealous action on the part of Unites States Attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.352" offset="5201398">The United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York believing that the state courts in 1868 had granted certificates of citizenship without proper formality issued a warning to all citizens who carried 1868 certificates of naturalization to bring them in and not to vote for fear they might be prosecuted and sent to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.028" offset="5308082">What Congress was concerned with was the protection of naturalized citizens and not the necessity or giving a club over United States Attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.358" offset="5621342">In fact, some of the changes that were made were to relax the educational requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.729" offset="5666900">We're told that there were five bills which constituted the basis for compromise and required the insertion of a provision exercising compulsion over United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.257" offset="5721025">Actually, if you look at the Government's brief, it appears that there were three bills plus two antecedents of those bills in earlier Congresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.443" offset="5761672">Those bills did a number of things in addition to providing that action might be brought either by the United States Attorney or by a private citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.958" offset="5799811">The committee reported not on those specific bills but the committee stated that if it considered all the bills which have been introduced in Congress before it introduced its measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.668" offset="5842651">And its measure contained the language that I mentioned at the beginning of this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.498" offset="5889985">In other words, the committee after considering these bills rejected the idea and decided that what was necessary was an affidavit of the condition of bringing the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.568" offset="8394188">The case was tried in the District Court mainly on the stipulation of facts which set forth that it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.029" offset="8420101">They'd known him only four-and-a-half years but that he believes that the dates were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.751" offset="8442984">He didn't' understand that it was only four-and-a-half years and if he known at the time he could have produced other the witnesses whose names he gave to the Court and would have said he's been there five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.019" offset="8479974">The District Court said, "We can't take that story.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.464" offset="8521770">On appeal, the parties stipulated not to print the affidavit of good cause but the appellant asserted that there was no evidence to support the finding of the Court of the truth of the allegation and the complaint that there was an affidavit of good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.018" offset="8591987">I would have thought that that was a pretty narrow issue to take to the Court that when an affidavit is filed with the complaint there is an affidavit and all that the Schwinn case holds and saying that you don't have to put in additional proof of the affidavit, all that it holds is that the facts that are set forth in the affidavit may be proved at the trial by someone else than the affiant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.332" offset="9609300">In the Bindczyck case, a citizen had been denaturalized on a motion made by the United States Attorney in a state court within the term seven days after he was naturalized on the ground of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.566" offset="9666247">He brought a declaratory judgment proceeding in the United States District Courts to prevent us to adjudge the validity of his citizenship and to prevent deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.398" offset="9777528">We cannot escape the conclusion that in its detailed provisions for revoking a naturalization because of fraud or illegal procurement not appearing on the face of the record, Congress formulated a self-contained exclusive procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.140" offset="9836460">Its procedure was self-contained and exclusive, it does away with the Government's argument that the complaint for denaturalization maybe brought into some general power instead of under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.379" offset="12001489">United States Attorneys, do not conduct investigations and the good cause must be supplied by some other agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.080" offset="12032313">This Court's reversal of the Minker case, I don't think indicates any opinion that the affidavit is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.536" offset="12062093">It simply indicates that the affidavit can't be obtained by compulsory testimony of the defendant in advance of the beginning of a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.226" offset="12096888">In fact, I believe the construction of the statute in the Minker case with its endeavor to protect the defendant is consistent of what we're arguing here that this affidavit is a necessary protection for the defendant and we submit that it's a reasonable protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.387" offset="12173479">I pointed out that it's something that the Government can supply without undue difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.813" offset="12207229">It does not, to my mind, open up a third round of the trial procedure as Mr. Bishop has told us yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.906" offset="12247562">If the affidavit is filed with the complaint, there'll be one motion if this question about the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.143" offset="12260519">There'll be a motion directed to the complaint and the affidavit instead of a motion directed to complaint, that's the same motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.207" offset="12324780">We don't take depositions on that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.626" offset="12334498">We may have a right to take depositions later on or ask for interrogatories and the affidavit may help us in taking those interrogatories and asking for those depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.676" offset="12386638">And the 60-day time that were allowed to answer can be better and more intelligently used if we have that affidavit which comes from files that the Government presumably already has before it brings the proceeding than if we have just a general complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.870" offset="13243455">And Congress when it passed the statute in 1906 considerate of the immigrants who were coming into this country by the million at that time and of there frequent lack of adequate legal protection and advice on the laws, Congress enacted a self-contained statute with provisions for the protection of the defendant with provisions that he might be sued for denaturalization only in the district where he lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.508" offset="13538011">I'll have to make the statements very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.444" offset="13545744">First, as to the information requested as to the number of denaturalization proceedings, we have not been able to compile that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.542" offset="13574165">At -- as of this moment that's being worked on and will be sent later because it's not classified down in detail to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.234" offset="13616901">We have no quarrel with the -- the intent, the obvious intent of the Congress as all of these years to protect from the admittedly serious matter of denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.740" offset="13674893">The question is not rather the denaturalization, the matter is serious but what did the Congress provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.557" offset="13702165">The commission whose report preceded the 1906 legislation said nothing about an affidavit at all and they were certainly concerned with safeguards because they put in the notice provision for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.548" offset="13778129">I -- I still must complain as I complained yesterday that that great gap between what was enacted and that power language which was well done today is not explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.621" offset="13826403">That appears on the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.644" offset="13834553">The difference in the language appears on page 26 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.972" offset="13851794">We have set it forth in the margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.104" offset="13860362">The language which had said the United States shall upon affidavit made by any credible person, have the power to institute proceedings, language which could indicate that the power is conditioned on it was changed to read into an entirely different thing, we think, making it a duty that said -- and that change is, that it shall be the duty of the United States district attorneys for the -- for the respective districts upon affidavit showing good cause therefore to institute proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.851" offset="14003304">There is no explanation of that change in terms of saying that they wanted to cut out the additional jurisdiction because they could do that and did that by a slight change in the second part of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.715" offset="14050847">But in the first part, there has been a material change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.746" offset="14062968">We have only hypothesis to explain that change and we have presented the fact that there were before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.161" offset="14088568">This Congress, three bills and before the preceding Congress, two bills which had given the citizen, an outside citizen, the right to present a natural -- denaturalization proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.310" offset="14137156">That's why we think this was a change to make it a duty and that it was to that duty that the affidavit related, that the United States Attorney could not be enforced to act.</text>
