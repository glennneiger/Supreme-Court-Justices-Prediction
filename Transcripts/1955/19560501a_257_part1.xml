            <text syncTime="3.068" offset="12225">I learned yesterday at my arrival here that the Court had enlarged the time of the respondents to an hour in view of the fact that I have the burden of stating the five cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Dunne</label>
            <text syncTime="23.436" offset="93727">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.187" offset="108669">Now, this is a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California which brings to this Court for review five cases decided in that Court, all involving and turning upon substantially the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.366" offset="189440">Each case was an action by an employee against his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.556" offset="222145">The employer as to part of its business was a common carrier by a railroad and as to a part of that business was engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.016" offset="268016">It was sought to sustain these actions for damages for personal injuries received on the job under the Federal Employers' Liability Act as amended in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.092" offset="332278">If that Act did not apply, then under California law, the sole remedy of these employees was under the compensation provisions of the California Labor Code and the soul body having jurisdiction to determine their benefits was the California Industrial Accident Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.404" offset="429558">The exclusive jurisdiction of that Commission could be ousted only if this federal statute applied and if it did not, the lower courts are without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.415" offset="481593">In the Gileo case, the matter of jurisdiction was reserved until the time of trial and was determined by the trial court as a matter of law in favor of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.955" offset="535719">The plaintiff had a judgment upon the verdict and that was affirmed by the Supreme Court of California after an intermediate Court of Appeal, the District Court of Appeal had determined the case should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.254" offset="592980">In the other four cases, which were pending in Sacramento, the jurisdictional question was separately tried to the Court sitting without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.989" offset="639896">In two of the cases, the Court determined that it had no jurisdiction and upon that face -- that face of the trial, entered judgment for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.782" offset="683050">Those judgements were reversed by the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.336" offset="705306">In the other two cases, the question was likewise separately determined and the trial court determined in favor of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.831" offset="751282">In both cases there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.671" offset="770612">In one of them, the judgment was added on the verdict and was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.849" offset="799347">In the other on motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto, the Court entered judgment for the defendant but not on the jurisdictional point upon the ground that no negligence had been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.781" offset="855040">That judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.331" offset="873221">So that in all five cases, the Supreme Court of California has determined that the trial courts had jurisdiction and that judgments should -- for the plaintiff should be affirmed where they had judgments and in the other two cases, the cases should go back for trial upon the question of negligence and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.186" offset="960679">The question that is presented here then is under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in Section 1 of that Act which is set out at pages 5 and 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.891" offset="1015536">You will notice that the statute is in two paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.487" offset="1033927">The critical words in the first paragraph are that the statute shall apply to every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between the States and so forth, and that such described employer shall be liable to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.236" offset="1176869">That language comes from the Act of 1908 and when the statute was amended in 1939, that language was reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.218" offset="1224829">There is a second paragraph of the statute and upon the other side it is claimed and it was so held by the Supreme Court of California that the critical language there was the controlling language and the provision there is that any employee of a carrier, any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce or shall, in anyway directly or closely and substantially, affect such commerce shall be for the purposes of the Act considered as having been employed in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.377" offset="1405492">I later shall want to comment on the history of that language in this amendment, how that language got in there and of course of the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.167" offset="1448647">I suggest first that this statute as it now reads poses two questions, does the employer fit the description of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="375.859" offset="1503399">And secondly, does the employee fit the description of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="382.362" offset="1529417">And that cases under the statute cannot be determined as the Supreme Court of California undertook to determine them by looking solely at the language that describes the employees who are brought under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.350" offset="1597336">Before going to that, I should now state in more detail for Your Honors the facts of these five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.683" offset="1634638">The Southern Pacific Company, as I stated, is a common carrier by railroad engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce, at least as to some of its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.322" offset="1685211">At Sacramento, California, it has a general shop, said to be the largest general railroad shops west of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.735" offset="1730873">Those general shops in the organization of the railroad are separate from the operating division that includes the City of Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.326" offset="1781238">Divisions usually have their own division shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.288" offset="1797120">This shop, however, is a general shop, although it does because it has the facilities, do some of the work for the Sacramento division.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.879" offset="1843513">There is, however, a separate organization and a separate chain of command in that shop going directly to the executive officers in San Francisco and not going through the superintendent of the Sacramento division, the operating division.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.944" offset="1907775">As a part of that shop for some 40 to 50 years, Southern Pacific Company has operated a wheel foundry where it makes cast iron freight car wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.443" offset="1961691">It does that in the usual way that all wheel manufacturers make their wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.747" offset="1990949">It uses, has the basic material, 97% of the material, scrapped wheels, outside wheel foundries do exactly the same thing and indeed require the exchange of an old wheel when a new wheel is purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.140" offset="2064509">The operation is a large operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.304" offset="2081123">In 1950, the wheel foundry produced over 67,000 wheels and in 1951 of over 65,000 wheels, a very few of them, 10 in one year, 16 in another are supplied to outside people.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.313" offset="2153221">Some small number about 700 or 800 go to a subsidiary Northwestern Pacific Railroad and the rest of them are used by Southern Pacific Company in replacements on its own cars and on foreign cars which require new wheels while on Southern Pacific lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.206" offset="2228767">The wheel foundry provides about 84% of the requirements of Southern Pacific Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.423" offset="2257607">The remaining 16% are purchased from outside wheel manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.259" offset="2284983">Aranda, for 11 years, had been a molder's helper and a molder in the wheel foundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.231" offset="2320823">He did no other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.347" offset="2329287">He was injured in the foundry while he was doing that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.889" offset="2347468">The answer sets out and the jury's verdict found that he had been paid compensation under the state act, the extent of $1448.57.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.243" offset="2412878">It returned a verdict for $12,000, deducted that amount and judgment presented for the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.248" offset="2444957">In that same general shop at Sacramento, Southern Pacific Company has a freight carshop, known as Carshop No.9.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.249" offset="2488947">That shop up until the 1st of July of 1950 was engaged in general repair work, light and heavy repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.710" offset="2526772">On the 1st of January of 1950, that shop undertook a program of construction of new cars, wholly new manufacture of freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.770" offset="2582988">In the latter part of 1950, the Southern Pacific Company determined to build 5000 units of freight train cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.219" offset="2636800">A little over 2000 for itself and some 2000 odd for a subsidiary, Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company, the T&amp;NO.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.619" offset="2686433">That matter was submitted to Southern Pacific Equipment Company, a subsidiary of Southern Pacific Company and it entered into a contract for the construction of those cars and for the sale of them to a financing institution and then for financing under an equipment trust and lease back to Southern Pacific Company with a privilege of sublease to T&amp;NO.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.238" offset="2796878">Southern Pacific Equipment Company, in turn, entered into a contract on the cost-plus basis with Southern Pacific Company for the use of the facilities in the Sacramento shop, for the shop facilities and machinery and for the supplying of laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.234" offset="2868872">That program progressed with some 1500 automobile cars up to January of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.579" offset="2918296">There was a break when they ran out of material and the program went on again with part of that 1500 automobile cars on the 13th of February and continued then on progressively.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.320" offset="2981198">The next program after that was 1000 gondola cars, gons as the railroad men call them, which moves the T&amp;NO and then some other cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.426" offset="3029682">Up to the time that the Gileo case was tried there had been manufactured in that shop 5400 new freight train cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.272" offset="3080986">Gileo, Eufrazia and Eelk were all injured while working in the construction of the program for 1000 TN&amp;O gons.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.026" offset="3148069">The way the system worked was that they used tracks on a regular assembly line basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.142" offset="3180565">The materials were placed at various stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.571" offset="3194253">At the beginning of the assembly line, they started with the trucks and then as the car moved on, additional parts were put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.817" offset="3235213">The assembly line produced 18 cars a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.007" offset="3259977">The work at each station took about 25 minutes and then the whole line moved on one station.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.284" offset="3301042">The setup was such that if a single man were absent from the assembly line, the whole assembly line stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.789" offset="3347122">The absence of one of four members of a riveting gang would prevent that riveting gang from operating on the end of a car and if that end of a car couldn't be finished, that car couldn't move and the rest of the line couldn't move.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.675" offset="3410651">For the purpose of providing a labor force for this work, when the work of new construction was instituted, the Southern Pacific Company employed a new force of men, substantially 300 men.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.921" offset="3491631">Now, since something is made of it, I should state to Your Honors the method of assigning them to work there.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.748" offset="3522978">These men belong to a brotherhood and they're all classified as carmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.644" offset="3550563">No matter whether they're working in wood or in steel, whatever the work is they are all carmen or carmen's helpers or apprentices.In the program for these TN&amp;O cars, there was something over 350 I think the figure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.308" offset="3625169">Carmen and carmen's helpers were employed on this particular program of -- in the yard I should say, in the shop of those, some 270 or about 74% percent were employed on new car construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.135" offset="3700506">These men were organized into separate division and the head of the shop was the general foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.127" offset="3724434">Under him were two assistant, a general foreman, one in charge of the repair work on cars in service and the other in charge of the work of new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.383" offset="3777515">Then under him were set up these gangs.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.272" offset="3797055">There was a certain amount of absenteeism among the men who are assigned to the new car construction work, which was the number one program of the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.340" offset="3845329">Accordingly in order that the work would not be stopped because of this absenteeism, carmen and carmen's helpers regularly assigned in the repair division would be brought over for the division for a new car construction on a temporary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.488" offset="3929861">One man who testified came over a half a day and then went back to his work on repair, but the men who are assigned to new car construction were not temporarily taken off that job for the purpose of doing repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.142" offset="4000496">The men were entitled on the basis of seniority to bid and they could bid into Carshop No.9 or they could bid into the sawmill or into the passenger carshop or into the local motor shop where a certain work was done on minor parts, but that was the only election they had in the selection of their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.118" offset="4100389">Once a man bid into Carshop No.9, what work he should do then was a matter of assignment by the general foreman and the general foreman could assign him to new car construction or he could assign him to repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.414" offset="4161620">And as I have suggested already to Your Honors, when the men were assigned to new car construction, they stayed on new car construction until the foreman changed that assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.474" offset="4217835">In 1951, the Southern Pacific determined to build a new yard known as a retarder yard for the classification of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.574" offset="4294217">At a point slightly east of Sacramento, California near Roosevelt, California, which is the point at the base of the sierras, where there was a large train yard on the main line over the sierras and east to Ogden, and where also lines coming down into California from Oregon converged with that line and converged with lines coming up from the southern part of California through the San Joaquin Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.801" offset="4431203">It was the point of classification for freight cars and the making up of the freight trains designed for the main transcontinental journey eastbound and the point at which westbound freight trains were broken up for purposes of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.704" offset="4514795">At Roseville, there had been to the east of a vacant space, two yards known as the west yard and the east yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.463" offset="4573832">Some distance to the west of that, there were two other freight train yards, the antelope yard and the high line yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.173" offset="4612598">And in between the two yards to the east and the two yards to the west in this open country there was -- there were four tracks, two main line tracks and two grill tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.284" offset="4677068">Southern Pacific Company determined to put in to that vacant space a retarder yard for the purpose of speeding up classification in the handling of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.844" offset="4731298">For that purpose -- project was a large one, running something over a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.703" offset="4754808">For that purpose, it acquired some 80 acres of additional land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.487" offset="4781871">It removed two county roads, it removed two power lines, it removed a telephone line and a telegraph line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.887" offset="4823458">It removed its own two drill tracks and it built two main line tracks for passenger service about a quarter of a mile to the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.891" offset="4871523">Then in this area, had brought in an outside contractor Morrison-Knudsen, moved about 300,000 yards of earth for purposes of grading, brought the grade to about three feet above the grade of the old main line and then undertook the installation of this retarder or hump yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.930" offset="4967654">A hump yard is a yard which is built, as the name suggest, with a hump at one end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.640" offset="4994508">And the cars are shoved up to the top of that hump on two tracks and then from then on the grade in that direction is downhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.707" offset="5034736">At the point of entry to the yard, there are built inspection pits and (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Dunne</label>
            <text syncTime="1525.363" offset="6101368">Now, the most striking feature aside from the addition of language in the amendment of 1939 is that the section of the Act, to which the second paragraph was added, was reenacted word for word as it had been enacted in 1908 and is -- it had read while this Court had considered as a matter of its application in some 40 to 50 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.076" offset="6224248">And that history I suggest to Your Honors is not only interesting but very illuminating and it goes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.868" offset="6259461">In the late 90's, Congress of the United States turned its attention to the injury of railroad workers and it started the enactment of a series of statutes commonly known as the Safety Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.334" offset="6317244">In 1907 for the same purpose, it added the Ash Pan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.180" offset="6340650">And in 1911 and 1915, for the same purpose, it added provisions of the Boiler Inspection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.135" offset="6376490">All directed at the matter of safety and all dealing with the condition of rolling equipment whether it be power or cars in use upon the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.473" offset="6429884">I suggest to Your Honors they're rather confined application of those various statutes and there's part of this mosaic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.925" offset="6475651">In 1906, the Congress enacted the first Employers' Liability Act which was to apply to all common carriers engaged in commerce and was to apply, that is interstate commerce and it said trade and commerce, and it applied to all of the employees of such employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.131" offset="6572513">In January of 1908, in the Howard case, the first Employers' Liability Act case, this Court held that statute be on the competence of Congress as this Court construed the statute and it construed that that's applying to all employees of such carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.696" offset="6654746">Mr. Justice Holmes and two other members of the Court dissented and Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent suggested that the statute could be saved by construing it to apply when engaged or while engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.871" offset="6723396">I suggest that because Congress followed that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.609" offset="6742413">Promptly in April of 1908, Congress adopted the present statute which has been amended several times but in no respects with which we are now concerned except in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.868" offset="6795389">And it designedly put in mark restrictions on the application of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.215" offset="6824856">It was now to employ -- apply only to railroads, common carriers which were railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.413" offset="6853590">Secondly, it was to apply them only while engaging in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.450" offset="6873757">Congress dropped the word "trade."</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.451" offset="6885773">And thirdly, it was not to apply to all employees but it was to apply to the employees only while employed by such carrier in such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.475" offset="6941884">This Court in a series of decisions, thereafter, recognized that this statute was part of this pattern of the Safety Acts aimed primarily if not exclusively, not exclusively but aimed primarily at the hazards that were peculiar to railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.426" offset="7037701">And this Court said in the (Inaudible) case that these statutes are all in pari materia and indeed in Urie against Thompson went so far as to say that these various safety statutes while not in form, in substance were amendments of the Federal Employers' Liability Act designed to assist the employees in recovery when they had been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.146" offset="7132578">Now, in the course of adjudication, this Court gave meticulous attention to the restrictive wording that Congress had written into the Act of 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.350" offset="7185345">It held in the first place that this very petitioner, Southern Pacific Company, although a common carrier by a railroad engaged in interstate commerce, did not fall within the Act when it was operating an offshore vessel, the famous case of Southern Pacific Company against Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.706" offset="7262772">One of the two points in that case was whether or not the competency of the State of New York to award compensation was removed by reason of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the Court held no, the Act did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.594" offset="7318361">And that has been followed down at least as to maritime employment by this Court in Nogueira case in 281 and very recently in the O'Rourke case in 344 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.032" offset="7384085">Secondly, it gave meticulous attention to the words of the statute that it applied when the employee was engaged in an interstate commerce and in an early case in 233, the Behrens case, this Court held that to give effect to that language you must to look to the precise work that the injured man was doing at the very time he was injured and it resulted from that as this Court pointed out in the Carr case and in the Nogueira case that a man might move in under the Act and move out again several times during the course of a single tour of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.930" offset="7539670">That would be peculiarly so in the case of switchmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.002" offset="7559941">And then finally, this Court came to the question of what is interstate commerce within the meaning of this Act and by a very slow and careful process, it evolved a test under the Act of 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.410" offset="7645623">It said itself that in 1920 it had departed from that test and in 1931 and 1932 in three cases in 284, this Court overruled its own decisions of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.472" offset="7713855">And what it did was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.288" offset="7725140">In the first step, the Pedersen case in 1913, it had before it the language and some rather restrictive language from the Howard case, it looked at the work of a man who was repairing, doing work in repairing a bridge, it was part of the highway of commerce, it said no of course that's not transportation but it's pretty close to it and it's so close to it that it really is a part of it, we'll apply the Act to him.But presently, there came along the Shanks case in 239 where a man was removing a countershaft in a repair shop and the Court reexamined the question then and it said we have to determine this question not by any conception involved in vacuo or in other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.119" offset="7924402">Well, we've got to look at the business that this statute was dealing with, we've got to look at the nature of the railroad business and we have to apply a practical test that is better suited to the occasion than some concept involved elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.546" offset="7994096">And it said when we look at the nature of the business of railroad and we find that its transportation, so that Congress in this Act when it was talking about commerce, was talking about transportation and therefore what falls under the Act is transportation or work so closely related to the actual transportation, has to be practically a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.007" offset="8107990">And shortly thereafter in the Davis case which is reported in 254, the Court examined and stated the rationale of that doctrine and it said obviously everybody who is employed by a railroad is important in its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.415" offset="8181656">Perhaps, the business couldn't go on without the presence of this particular employee but the Act doesn't cover all the employees of the railroad, it was unlike the Act of 1906 in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.788" offset="8235050">And so, we have to narrow down and narrow down and narrow down until we come to those activities which are close to the heart of the business being dealt with railroading and transportation and exactly that same process was going through again in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.027" offset="8328046">When this Court reexamined, carefully reexamined the whole question restated the rationale of the Davis case and overruled the Collins and Schware cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.913" offset="8387605">Now, it resulted from this process of adjudication that the moment of injury rule had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.661" offset="8434625">A man would be in the rule one minute, under the Act one minute and then when he finished with an interstate car and was handling an intrastate car and switching, he was out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.690" offset="8470674">And then his next assignment after that would be back in the Act and that had produced borderline cases and it was felt that that had produced considerable hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.626" offset="8514456">There was another type of case which was somewhat outstanding and the Davis case itself was one.He was at local motor dedicated generally to interstate commerce but it had to be repaired and so it was taken to the back shop and in that sense was withdrawn from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.924" offset="8591673">It fall within the Act but it didn't, was it like the bridge which is permanently dedicated or was it something that had temporary character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.529" offset="8626051">The decision of this Court was that it had a temporary character in this sense that it was withdrawn from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.077" offset="8656248">A man doing work of heavy repair on local motors and other equipment withdrawn from service did not fall under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.119" offset="8684460">And then there was the close problem presented by this Court's own decisions in Collins against Schware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.329" offset="8709224">Now, those were men who engaged in accessorial services not directly connected with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.755" offset="8742975">Those were men -- one man was operating pumping water to be supplied to local motors and the other man was drying sand to be used in local motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.901" offset="8787592">Now, that in short and in summary, the detail is considerably more than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.780" offset="8815073">That was the background of the Act of 1939 and Congress in 1939 wanted to do what it could to clarify these borderline cases and to remove this moment of injury rule where a switchman who was injured would have his remedy under this Act or under a state act on the luck of the draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.185" offset="8912666">There is one other consideration I think that this Court must have before it in considering the -- what Congress did in 1939 and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.223" offset="8960836">In 1908, when the first Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted, there were no state compensation acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.264" offset="8993019">In 1939, every state had some form of compensation act or other legislation for a workman generally with the exception of two and taking as an example my own State of California, we not only had a compensation act there that was comprehensive but in addition had enacted some safety statutes and had given to a local commission the power to enact safety rules and that Commission had enacted a code to safety rules of something over 1300 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.446" offset="9133767">None of which will apply to men who are under Federal Employers' Liability Act and which cover fields of safety regulation far beyond the confined field to which the said Federal Safety Acts and Boiler Inspection Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.009" offset="9219971">In other words, the farther the application of the Federal Employers' Liability Act is extended, the greater will be the area in which the man will have no safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.856" offset="9275350">Now, in such circumstances, Congress did not take -- undertake a revamping of the whole Federal Employers' Liability Act and we have in a very illuminating doctrine, a document upon which -- upon what Congress wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.613" offset="9350374">Amendments had been introduced in the House and in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.551" offset="9374198">In the Senate alone was there introduced an amendment which would affect the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.689" offset="9402723">The amendments in the House had to do with features of the Act with which we're not concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.412" offset="9425607">And the Senate Committee in reporting the Act to the Senate wrote a fairly lengthy report in which it stated what had been done and what was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.806" offset="9487151">And from that and from the hearings, the following emerges, if I may call the Court's attention now to precise language of the Act, the opening part of the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.006" offset="9563951">That amendment as originally proposed would have read this way that any employee of a carrier, any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce or shall, in anyway, affect such commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.894" offset="11115520">And I think the history of the statute, particularly in the light of the Senate Report, will indicate that clearly it was not intended that all employees of a common carrier by railroad which was engaged in interstate commerce should be brought in this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.268" offset="12624980">That for the purposes of this Act, commerce is transportation, all work so closely connected to it has to be practically a part of it and that to get the true meaning of the amendment of 1939, it must be read with this Court's established and untampered with definition of interstate commerce as though it were in the Act and as though the new and added paragraph read this way, "That it applied only to employees of a carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.798" offset="15007138">And prior to 1939, the whole situation had got to be such a mess that the railroad brotherhoods went to Congress on these lunch box cases and a switchman working one minute in interstate commerce and the next minute in local commerce, that Mr. McGrath representing the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen that I have represented for many years and other brotherhoods went to the Congress and they asked the congressional committee and particularly the Senate Committee that was considering this matter and primarily interested in trying to remedy these defects to do something about this moment of injury thing and all of these problems, it wasn't just a moment of injury, it was to get away from these borderline cases, from these hairline distinctions where a man had to take four years to find out where his remedy was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.738" offset="15226880">It was the most ridiculous situation that he would be situated where he's a switchman in the yard and we got two tracks here and on the first track, if he's injured on the first track handling one car, he's under local commerce and if his fellow worker on the second track is injured, he's handling interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.618" offset="15322384">And there wasn't any question in anybody's mind about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.104" offset="15336385">There wasn't any argument before the Senate Judiciary Committee or in the legislature that these things should be remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.114" offset="15372434">It was a ridiculous situation and the courts had floundered around on the thing to the point where you couldn't tell where a man stood, and it wished to sweep away this whole line of decisions that Mr. Dunne is talking about and to bring about a new era so that the man and the brotherhoods and the people concerned with the rights of these men wouldn't know within reason and with some clearcut the lines of distinction where they could go and where the remedy was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3913.373" offset="15653407">Well, that's quite different from the old conception, here's the old conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.649" offset="15670544">In the old conception as they worked out on the Shanks case, here would be transportation, this is the lectern transportation and then if the man is here, he's in any part of the lectern, he's on transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.434" offset="15733656">But the new concept is not just transportation, it's furtherance of interstate commerce if this is meeting up there in the table or that table or others leaving on up to this lectern.</text>

            <text syncTime="5310.327" offset="21241208">But here, you have freightmen out on work trains, you have the section gangs that do the same kind of work that their fellows do, they're all born with the same union, they're all in the same setup, they're under the Railway Labor Act, Railroad Retirement Act and all these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.870" offset="21295438">It seems to me the broad sweep of the -- of the new amendment would include all of these kind of former borderline cases that the courts were struggling with formerly and saying, “Well, we can't include new construction because it isn't right in this lectern here of the transportation field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.822" offset="21371193">And I -- I think that those old cases were swept out the window by the 1939 amendment that certainly the 1939 amendment means something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.201" offset="21412780">It doesn't just mean that -- that Congress was reaffirming this old line of cases that Mr. Dunne has quoted to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.956" offset="21455726">It means that as a broader conception and that these men shouldn't have such difficulty in determining where they're to go and what their rights are and -- and the language is pretty fraud that furtherance of interstate commerce, I think, means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.784" offset="21519047">I don't believe Congress was idle in its use of the term or that it intended merely to limit it to the old conception or why should they have passed the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.392" offset="21557499">It was to eliminate all that, just as the Supreme Court of California said to include injured employees previously excluded and eliminate confusions and hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.788" offset="21607131">Now, these are the kind of cases that bring about the confusion and hardship and doubt where you got men working in the same union under the same contracts, the same seniority setup, interchangeable when their duties might be working one month over on this new construction, the next month the other place or one year one place, the other year the other back and forth thereon, those all should they all be in the same classification, otherwise how can you properly advise them or can they properly be represented and where -- how do they know where they're going to wind up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.176" offset="21724682">It seems to me this Court should lay down some rule that Congress meant what it said and it said furtherance of interstate commerce on a really broad basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="5449.936" offset="21799706">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.356" offset="21813394">My -- my client is what Mr. Hilderbrand has referred to as a car toad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.035" offset="21848085">That's -- in other words, he's really a railroad man just like the railroad refers to engineers sometimes as fog heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.410" offset="21881626">They refer to Mr. Eufrazia as a car toad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.756" offset="21898971">Now, he started in this particular branch of work in September of 1950 at the Carshop No.9 in Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.853" offset="21943380">Now, when he started into work there, he was on this new car program which is the same program that he was on when he got hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.315" offset="21985176">However, in the interval between the time when he first started on this new car program and the time of his injury, he was switched over to this repair work where he was doing all sorts of repairs including running repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.490" offset="22069917">In March of 1950, he was raised to the status of an advanced helper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.122" offset="22100428">Now, an advanced helper is a man and who was qualified to do all sorts of work which a carman is qualified to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.708" offset="22134805">He could ream, he could weld, he could rivet and he was used for all those various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.412" offset="22169600">Now, in June -- rather on June -- rather June 13th, 1951, he was taken from the repair work and he was assigned in this program which he was originally on of reaming ends in these gondola ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.877" offset="22271478">Now, the tools he was working with are much the same as they use in the repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.441" offset="22305750">He was working in a place that was setup as one integrated whole, it was all under the supervision of Mr. Harry Heiky.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.474" offset="22341799">Mr. Heiky had the privilege of assigning these men from one place to the other, that is from repairs to new construction and for instance if Mr. Eufrazia were reaming a hole on this new end, he could say, “Well, Mr. Eufrazia, we'd like you to go and ream a hole in this car, they got sideswiped."</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.031" offset="22428108">He could switch him around and in fact the immediate supervisor of Mr. Eufrazia was Mr. Fagan and he was simultaneously supervising this assembling of new cars and also assembling the repair or old cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.428" offset="22513685">In other words, that here you have this foreman, the -- and one immediate -- but immediately above Mr. Eufrazia in the chain of command and we have Mr. Fagan not only supervising the activities of the event in this assembling of new cars but also we have him supervising this repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.913" offset="22611592">As Mr. Hilderbrand has pointed out, all these work was going on side by side, the men were interchangeable and from time to time they did get reassigned, for instance, when due to absenteeism, when a man was absent from this assembly line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.565" offset="22702184">I believe that's admitted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.616" offset="22710439">When was absent from the assembly line, Mr. Heiky could go over and get a man from the new car work and tell him go ahead and be on this construction work, that is, if some of these men gets sick or layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.705" offset="22762789">I don't think it was really quite as a precision or clock work arrangement as Mr. Dunne states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.295" offset="22793091">I think it back when my client was injured, there were two men off of that job, that's one of the reasons he happened to get injured of this reaming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.114" offset="22832379">Now, it's very important to Mr. Eufrazia merely to be under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.179" offset="22868637">For one thing, he belongs to the Southern Pacific Hospital Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.730" offset="22886818">He pays his dues there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.063" offset="22896222">If he gets ill, he's -- it's unlike the men that are in -- of course, theoretically it might sound very fine to say and perhaps to a theorist that might sound very fine to say that this man, if he's not under this F.E.L.A, he's got a remedy, he's got the workmen's compensation but our Workmen's Compensation Act isn't really designed to cover car toads or railroad carman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.772" offset="22999040">This man is a railroad man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.138" offset="23004473">Now, he belongs to the Southern Pacific Hospital Association, if he gets hurt or if he gets ill, he goes down to the Southern Pacific Hospital down in San Francisco or possibly to our emergency hospital in Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.964" offset="23067794">He's treated by these railroad doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.672" offset="23078661">He contributes into that in a fund and the railroad also contributes in this fund and all of our railroads in the west at any rate have such arrangements, therefore, it's more or less geared with the F.E.L.A, it's not geared with our Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5796.459" offset="23185763">That was -- however, I understand that -- I believe that this wording has put him under that -- that 1908 already meaningless or rather 1939 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.505" offset="23233933">Well, they seem to go pretty far on that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.642" offset="23242501">However, I think that under this latest act what he was doing even if -- even if his whole work was a construction on these new cars, I think what he is doing directly and substantially affects interstate commerce, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.912" offset="23315644">I think that -- that's certainly is in furtherance of it, he's building new cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.095" offset="23336333">You can't make this -- this railroad run without cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.278" offset="23353051">They have to have this to supplement their existing rolling stock which -- which is what they were really doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.925" offset="23375621">These cars wear out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.667" offset="23382622">When they wear out, where they take them into Carshop No.9 and they fixed them and then when they needed more either through an expansion of business or through the complete demolition of these cars where they replace them with new cars and they did both of these activities in Carshop No.9, both activities being under the supervision of Mr. Heiky so it's really one integrated deal like if its -- what they call a freight car department.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.829" offset="23499233">They've got one department that's Carshop No.9, that's freight car department, they have this assembling program there and they have these repairs of all sorts in Carshop No.9 which distinguishes it from Carshop No.3 which is the passenger car department or the machinist department.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.551" offset="23574152">It was all really an integrated whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.266" offset="23585019">Now, this -- as I started to say that this -- it is very important to Mr. Eufrazia, it's to his welfare to be under the Federal Employers' Liability Act even in our fine compensation act which we have in California which is much superior due to the efforts of our governor in making -- and -- and with some help from our legislature in passing a rather liberal compensation act, still the amount that these men actually get under this Act, if that's their consideration, doesn't compare with what they could even settle all these suits for under the F.E.L.A. because under the F.E.L.A, there's a word for pain and suffering or disfigurement and all those items whereas under the comp act they -- even in our California, it's more or less based on your disability to earn your living.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.048" offset="23832137">You've got to show that your finger is off or something so that you can't -- so that you're disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.064" offset="23852199">And also the minimum now I think of California is $40 a week which certainly doesn't compare with what they earned when they earned $300 a month and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.036" offset="23904131">So that they can even, with no strain at all, come out financially much better under this F.E.L.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.978" offset="23935896">And of course California is one of the better or the best comp acts but you take many states like down in -- several of them, the minimums run -- I've -- I've listed them in my brief on page 9, the various -- a month it goes down to $25 weekly in Arkansas and the death benefits vary from $17,500 in Minnesota down to $6000 in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.889" offset="24091481">Also they have various defenses, for instance, in some of them the willful failure to use safety devices is a complete defense in 13 States and then they have its -- in other words, I think in the railroading industry you ought to have a uniform act that applies to all railroad workers whether they happen to do have a good fortune of being injured in California, whereas liberally it -- or relatively liberal or the misfortune of being injured in one of the States where the compensation is much lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.473" offset="24225855">And as Mr. Dunne says, two of these States don't have any Workmen's Compensation Act as I understood him to say but more than that there's something more because five of these States exclude all railroad workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.779" offset="24287086">Those are the States of Texas, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina and the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.629" offset="24346436">Those are five States that if you work for any railroad intra or interstate, some of them work in any common carrier, some of them say any hazardous occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.307" offset="24389172">The man has to bring a common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.085" offset="24408294">In Washington, they adopt the F.E.L.A, they say you can't distinguish between -- in their statute, you can't distinguish between people that are in intra or interstate commerce when they work for a railroad, it's all the same problem so they have a little F.E.L.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.225" offset="24472869">However, in the States of Florida, you'll find they have a limited fellow servant document, it has to be a fellow servant of the superior quest or another category and not a -- just a person like two section hands such as we have in the F.E.L.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.805" offset="24539220">In other words, if one section hand picks another one in the foot with a peck, we have liability on the F.E.L.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.823" offset="24567223">In the State of Florida, you wouldn't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.458" offset="24577776">In the State of South Carolina, you wouldn't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.394" offset="24589479">In the State of Virginia, they also have that limited doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.813" offset="24607242">And then also in North Carolina and -- and let's see, one of this other States they have a limited assumption of risk policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.719" offset="24662831">In other words, you have to show that they violate a statute or the employee assumes the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.661" offset="24698567">Therefore, I think that for the sake of uniformity, both in the industry, it's very confusing to these men that they're doing exactly the same thing on one track.</text>
            <text syncTime="6184.300" offset="24737123">If they're reaming there and they say you're in the F.E.L.A., this fellow workman, he's right on the next track.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.924" offset="24759693">He is doing the same thing, he's reaming too and then you say one of these men is in the F.E.L.A., I was going to explain that to his client and say well -- you'll come in and say, "Well, Mr. Jones over her, he was reaming and he hurt his knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.687" offset="24818730">I think I should have my action on the F.E.L.A." I understood he got a pretty good selling in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.605" offset="24838374">I understood he got $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.092" offset="24848300">You tell me here I'm reaming on a new car and all I can get is $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.353" offset="24869407">Well, that's pretty arguing to explain, I mean the technicality of that -- your client.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.586" offset="24890305">And so, also, I think looking at it from a wider scope, from nation to nation or rather from state to state that they should be uniformity treated and if you exclude these people in Carshop No.9 here that rather so it's been made, it happened to be a new construction and you create chaos because -- and it will be very hard on these railroad men.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.388" offset="25001482">I'll conclude my argument unless the Court has any questions they're willing to ask me?</text>

            <text syncTime="6268.949" offset="25075775">I represent two clients, each of whom recovered jury verdicts for damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.842" offset="25107331">Certainly as to one of them, I believe that he would have been covered by the Act had he been injured even prior to 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.556" offset="25138155">The reasons for feeling that way will be made to appear, but I think one of the first things which I should do is to try to clarify for the Court the meaning of the language used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.077" offset="25200222">Now, I think the best way to get an understanding of what the amendment is all about is to refer to the statements made by Senator Austin when these words were placed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.862" offset="25271380">On page 64 of Mr. Dunne's brief in a footnote he labeled 100C, Senator Austin's language is setout and I think perhaps it will put to rest once and for all what was meant when the language was inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.442" offset="25345672">If the Court will notice this very thorough and excellent brief by the petitioners, Senator Austin was concerned as to what courts might interpret this language to mean.Before his suggested change, the language have simply been -- that coverage would include anybody who in anyway affected commerce but Senator Austin wanted some understanding, he wanted to use a word of art as Mr. Justice Reed has said and so he suggested words of art which had settled meaning, and he suggested that the language should be changed to read in anyway directly or closely and substantially affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6384.406" offset="25537620">Now, what do those words mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.621" offset="25546397">They mean what the Court said they meant in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.624" offset="25570429">Proof of that is to quote Mr. Austin -- Senator Austin, my amendment was to substitute for the words "or in anyway -- the words "directly closely and substantially."</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.847" offset="25627376">That is the law as it is interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States in the National Labor Relations Board against the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.792" offset="25679099">Now, what Senator Austin was saying was I want to use words that the -- that the Supreme Court has already given meaning to and the meaning I intend to give in this statute is a meaning the Supreme Court has given in the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.763" offset="25747017">I think that's the complete answer as to what was meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.135" offset="25760496">As to whether or not the amendment to the Act did anything other than enlarge the definition of the employee, my answer is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.663" offset="25802606">The Congress was satisfied with the meaning of the word "employer" as used in the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.654" offset="25850567">Congress had no intention of extending at least as the debates developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.958" offset="25871778">Congress did not intend to extend the word "employer" to anybody except railroads engaged in interstate commerce, but what Congress wanted to do was extend the courage to employees of railroads engaged in interstate commerce with them having been satisfied with the definition of employer, not wanting to include truckers, not wanting to include express companies, not wanting to include anybody except railroads as had heretofore been done, they left that part of the Act intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.011" offset="25996016">But when it came to the employee, the intention was to make a very broad, a very general and a very sweeping inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.454" offset="26029767">That's exactly what the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.483" offset="26041887">As refers to my two clients, Mr. Moreno and Mr. Aranda, I think the cases are different from the others and for that reason require some very brief statements of the particular facts as related to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.065" offset="26104163">This is especially true since the facts, as stated in the very excellent brief of the petitioners, doesn't -- is not quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.730" offset="26138854">Let us say it tells the truth but not the whole truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6538.258" offset="26152960">And I think in order to understand the implications of these cases we must know the whole truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.790" offset="26179082">The retarder yard, where Moreno worked, was an integrated project composed of three parts, one part was called a receiving yard, another part was called a classification yard, another part was called a departure yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.919" offset="26259644">Of those three yards, the retarder yard was composed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.366" offset="26285453">Now, the retarder yard then was one integrated project composed of those three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.761" offset="26315024">When then was the yard finished?</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.910" offset="26323592">When was it put into operation?</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.134" offset="26332473">In the petitioner's brief, they state that the yard was not put into operation until April of 1952, where Moreno was injured in December of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.662" offset="26378553">But if the Court will notice the language in the brief and in the argument, he says, “No revenue trains went over the lines until then.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.770" offset="26407079">I don't know when that ever became a test whether the train was a revenue line and not how would an employee ever apply that test, how would he ever know whether this freight train was a revenue train or whether it was just a train that the president of the corporation was riding on, he'd have no way of knowing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.999" offset="26459951">So I think the revenue train test is no test whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.249" offset="26472908">But the record shows that the depart -- that the first part of this project, the receiving yard was completed in August of 1951 and put in operation, that was several months before Moreno was ever employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.285" offset="26549081">It -- the record also shows that in October, the old main line was -- was being removed so that the retarder yard could be reconstructed and the receiving yard was in use as a classification yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6656.007" offset="26624000">So then this whole project was partially completed before Moreno started work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.920" offset="26643644">And by the time he was injured much of it was in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.767" offset="26659004">Let's, for example, ask this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6668.548" offset="26674155">Suppose Moreno had been injured on the receiving yard, which was completed in August, then would he have been covered by the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.159" offset="26708532">I think the answer must be yes, because this was a part of the yard in operation for all purposes in interstate commerce and he would have been covered by even prior to the 1939 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.087" offset="26756284">Then if he had been hurt while he was removing cross ties from the old main line so it could be relocated, certainly, he would have been covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6698.632" offset="26794527">Now, does his right to recovery under the Act depend upon which part of the yard he gets hurt in?</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.195" offset="26824725">That would seem to be a strange test to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6710.142" offset="26840503">The next thing is that this yard where Moreno was hurt, the very day he was injured, the very moment of his injury, he was using cross ties from the old main line helping to construct this so-called new main line in this retarder yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.280" offset="26913019">Now, if we look at this situation, suppose he had been hurt while he was taking the old cross tie out of the old main line which had been in operation all of these years, then would he have been covered by the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.700" offset="26958785">I can think of no way to exclude him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6741.744" offset="26966936">Forget when he takes that same cross tie over to another spot and starts to put it down so as to make a new method of switching, you exclude him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.424" offset="27001626">That would seem to be a form of technicality which certainly I cannot understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.444" offset="27025763">Now, it is also significant that Moreno lived on the railroad tracks in what they call outfit cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.902" offset="27075605">In other words, it put a little square track off -- off the main line and he lived in freight cars what they call outfit cars and he commuted from the railroad track where he lived over to the retarder yard where he worked.</text>
