            <text syncTime="34.559" offset="138136">He was not informed of the indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.370" offset="153391">He was not arrested on the alleged crime until October of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.964" offset="187768">The time had proscribed -- long proscribed when he was arrested and brought to the jurisdiction, the court of Louisiana jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.584" offset="226325">That was a year and seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.427" offset="233639">The time had expired already when he was placed in the Parish Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.147" offset="256522">When he was placed in the Parish prison, the case was set for arraignment for October 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.812" offset="283167">He was brought down the 3rd of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.082" offset="292258">He was set for the 25th of October, 1952 and I was retained the afternoon of the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.904" offset="339592">So, on the morning of the 25th, on arraignment, I went to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.398" offset="361535">And I asked the Court for a continuance of the arraignment for the purpose of allowing me to file pleadings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.376" offset="409496">On -- the Court granted me until November 7, 1952 to file those pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.491" offset="441887">On November the 7th, 1952, we appeared in Court and we filed our motion to quash the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.522" offset="482011">The -- when we filed the motion to quash the indictment, the State asked for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.355" offset="509388">And the Court granted them until November 17th to their continuance to answer of filing the pleadings in answer to my motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.757" offset="562991">On November -- on November 17th, 1952, the State filed its demurrer to my motion to quash claiming that the -- the motion was filed too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.014" offset="611997">Now, the only difference between my case and the case of Michel and Labat is that my client Poret wasn't even arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.936" offset="663719">He didn't have counsel at the time that -- the time limit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.554" offset="682214">He had three days after March the 5th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.105" offset="704366">That is until March the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.540" offset="710113">He had until March the 8th, 1951, to file his motion to quash under Article 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.338" offset="10625254">It's just short and it will take a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.231" offset="10632882">In answer to Poret's objection, you can't apply 202 to me because he says, “I don't know anything about this indictment and therefore, it's unconstitutional to file against me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.963" offset="10671752">“It's not true,” says the Supreme Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.561" offset="10682201">And I think the reasoning is -- is very fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.961" offset="10695784">That the defendant Poret was denied an opportunity to file his motion timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.423" offset="10709682">He was indicted on December 11, 1950, had until March 8, 1951, a period of almost three months in which to file his motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.924" offset="10735595">Now, why -- why didn't he file it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.539" offset="10746149">His own actions to avoid for prosecution caused him not to avail himself for the right to challenge the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.006" offset="10767987">This is a choice which he exercised, says the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.872" offset="10779481">During this time, he could have filed a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.930" offset="10787631">He was a fugitive by his own choice and will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.952" offset="10799752">If we concede that his flight made it impossible for him to file a motion timely, he himself knew about the situation which made it impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.152" offset="10828591">To our minds, it would be improper to hold that the prescriptive period provided on the statute is applicable to the accused held under arrest within the jurisdiction of the Court, but is not applicable to the accused, who of his own will, the Court has absconded to avoid prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.763" offset="10883030">Such a holding would be tantamount to rewarding the absconding person for his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.253" offset="10901002">Moreover, the article provides for prescriptive theory which runs against the accused and he can't by any acts of his own extend the time provided for in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.623" offset="10930469">Now, I suggest that actually what this gets itself down to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.587" offset="10950322">The Supreme Court of Louisiana has found that there is no exception to 202 with respect to fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.920" offset="10967667">And on a well recognized principle which we've already discussed, this Court, I think will accept that finding, unless -- unless it's unreasonable and unless it's designed to -- to hurt -- to -- to deprive somebody of a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.790" offset="11023151">And unless it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.013" offset="11027958">Then it violates the due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.522" offset="11037989">The issue gets down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.375" offset="11045407">Is it unreasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.168" offset="11052617">Is it unconstitutional for the State of Louisiana to refuse to reward someone who is a fugitive because he was successful in his flight?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.807" offset="11087203">It gets down to that narrow point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.726" offset="11094831">Is it unreasonable or is it therefore unconstitutional for the State of Louisiana to provide that a fugitive shall not get any special privileges by reason of the fact that he's a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.999" offset="11139971">Congress does virtually the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.981" offset="11151882">And we cite the -- the statute of limitations and everyone that I could find says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.035" offset="11172049">We treat certain people, if you're not prosecuted within the certain time, you can't prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.930" offset="11191693">What about a fugitive?</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.365" offset="11197440">Congress says that we're going to reward him because he pled no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.507" offset="11209979">That statute of limitations will not apply to a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.394" offset="11221473">I can find -- and I could find none that does and I submit that the logic behind that statute of limitation, certainly it's a different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.052" offset="11252193">But the logic behind the refusal to reward a fugitive is as applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.138" offset="11272464">The Supreme Court says we are faced with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.587" offset="11282286">Will we reward a fugitive?</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.770" offset="11286988">And says, "No, we will not."</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.420" offset="11293675">And this Court must be told that it's refusal to reward a fugitive is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.718" offset="12646818">But he was in the case for over two months while its prescriptive period in 202, the statute of limitations was running.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.751" offset="12682971">We call the Court's attention in brief to several cases from the Circuit Courts of Appeal where the Courts have held and I suggest properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.472" offset="12713796">Number one, first of all, that there's a presumption that counsel was confident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.412" offset="12729574">Man is licensed to practice law, we assume in the absence of the showing to the contrary that he is competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.321" offset="12753189">Secondly, that his incompetence must be such as to shock the conscience of the Court before the Court would set aside proceedings on the ground of ineffective counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.843" offset="12795298">He must make, says -- says the Circuit Court a sham and a mockery of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.940" offset="12819749">Now, with this background, what have we here to indicate whether or not Mr. Mahoney was effective, whether he was a competent counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.632" offset="12850469">The only thing in the record to indicate that is the Supreme Court of Louisiana's language which we quote in our brief which the Supreme Court has never said about me or about a lot of lawyers whom I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.455" offset="12893727">And which the Supreme Court of Louisiana said, mind you, not in just complimenting Mr. Mahoney that he's a nice fellow or was, but because there was an attack made upon him in the Supreme Court of Louisiana that he was not competent and ineffective and what does the Court say?</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.202" offset="13132800">Because what could Mr. Mahoney have done inside of this period of a year and two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.196" offset="13156728">Come into Court and say, I realized I've got an electric chair case, it's a very tough case on the facts and I realize that the State witnesses might die or leave the jurisdiction or get caught and that the facts may not be able to be proved in a year, but I want you to try my man tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.505" offset="13217959">That's what he could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.195" offset="13224751">He could have said, "I want you to put this man in trial, right now."</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.367" offset="13237394">Now, aside from that, the only other thing he could have done was file this motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.142" offset="13260487">And I'd like to examine what the result of that would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.885" offset="13271458">Assuming that the motion to quash was time -- was timely filed and then it was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.466" offset="13297789">It would result in a finding by the District Court, and counsel was called in the Court's attention to the fact that at least one our judges has so found that the grand jury was improperly (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.132" offset="13340526">So then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.299" offset="13349094">I suggest that within a period of a very short time, this man would be indicted again by a valid grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.423" offset="13381590">But, instead of that what does Mr. Mahoney do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.747" offset="13394965">And as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, I -- he made very well and all the counsel in this case made very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.989" offset="13415863">I don't say that it was true but it could be may very well have reached the positive determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.987" offset="13439896">I would rather not file this thing timely and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.480" offset="13453897">Because if I don't' file it timely, then I can attack 202 as being unconstitutional after my trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.359" offset="13481378">Then I'll get a trial by petit jury and I'll take my chances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.136" offset="13492454">I might get a good verdict from that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.105" offset="13500395">If I don't, I haven't lost anything because then I'm not effective counsel.</text>
