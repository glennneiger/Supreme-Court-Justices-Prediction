            <label>Mr. Edward Donald Moseley</label>
            <text syncTime="11.180" offset="44617">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.741" offset="54962">This suit is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.031" offset="88085">The issue before the Court primarily and basically is as to whether or not the Government is liable to the petitioner under the Tucker Act for the value of certain timber which was destroyed during the course of a levee enlargement project on the main stem of the Mississippi River in Concordia Parish, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.322" offset="197277">Basically, the Government contends that the property was subject to a repair in servitude that this servitude was correctly exercised by the Levee Board having jurisdiction over this area and that the Government derived its rights through the Levee Board and therefore it should not be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.704" offset="290795">The petitioner, on the other hand, contends that there was never any valid or proper appropriation of its property and that in any event if the property was destroyed not pursuant to anything which the Levee Board did or did not do but was destroyed as a direct act of the exercise of the Government's own sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.008" offset="396016">This suit was initially filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.352" offset="429349">There were actually two suits filed which were consolidated, both arising out of the same set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.484" offset="465920">The District -- the petitioner claim that approximately 260 acres of timberland lying all along the banks of the Mississippi adjacent to the river and between the river and levee were destroyed by government contractors in carrying out an enlargement of the existing levee.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.440" offset="553691">Under the law of Louisiana, I might point out that timber may be owned separately and apart from the land upon which it is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.435" offset="601652">Here, the petitioner owned a timber situated on -- in this area and the fee to the property was owned by a separate party, however, the same law relating to immovables is applicable as to timber so long as it is still standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.177" offset="664660">I might further point out to the Court that under the law of Louisiana, the property adjacent to a navigable stream is susceptible of private ownership down to its -- the low average, main low line of the water and although the property is burdened with a servitude, the property may be bought and sold the same as any other property despite the fact that it is subject to a servitude for levee purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.923" offset="823589">Under the specific law of Louisiana, there is a general servitude for levee purposes which extends not only to the area immediately adjacent to the levee itself but to whatever area may be reasonably -- reasonably necessary in order for the proper exercise of the servitude for flood control purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.768" offset="915017">That is -- the exigencies of the situation might require even that an area actually beyond the levee itself be burdened with the servitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.860" offset="1027344">That is -- well, it -- probably it is the general servitude and applies reasonably as our contention, sir, that there has to be a reasonable application of the servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.062" offset="1072170">The -- the District Court -- first, I might point out that this suit was originally brought both under the provisions of the Tucker Act and alternatively under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.654" offset="1130580">However, the petitioner ultimately abandoned its claim as under the Tort Claims Act and as -- we are claiming relief solely upon the basis of the Tucker Act at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.576" offset="1182302">Initially, also, the contractors who performed this work and destroyed this timber were joined as party as defendant to the suit but they were dismissed from the action on the motion of -- of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.542" offset="1234129">The District Court after a very mature deliberation of this entire matter, the case was tried, of course, before the Court without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.133" offset="1272477">The District Court, Judge Dawkins, held initially that the Levee Board should have -- have exercised its right of appropriation by following the expropriation procedure, which is an eminent domain procedure, specifically set forth under the Louisiana statutes and that in the absence of following this specific procedure, the Levee Board did not affect a valid appropriation of the property and that therefore the Government should be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.416" offset="1429629">Following that on a -- on a motion, I might point out also that the -- that the -- the Government filed a third party complaint against the Levee Board and the suit was tried both as against the Government and the Levee Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.796" offset="1499115">In his original opinion, Judge Dawkins held that both -- that the Levee -- the Government was liable to the petitioner and that the Levee Board was liable over to the Government under the provisions of the federal Flood Control Act requiring local authorities to furnish essential right-of-ways in connection with levee projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.916" offset="1587618">On a motion for -- on a new trial, however, Judge Dawkins held, first of all, that the Government had not required out of the Levee Board a valid appropriation of this property and that in the absence of a valid appropriation of the property by the Levee Board in the absence of the Government requiring that to taking -- was a taking directly by the Government itself for which the Government which should be held liable under the provisions of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.954" offset="1719798">On appeal to the Fifth Circuit, the judgment of Judge Dawkins was reversed with Judge Cameron discerning.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.626" offset="1762429">The Fifth Circuit held that this property had been validly appropriated by the Levee Board under Louisiana law and that since it had been validly appropriated for levee purposes, the -- there was no liability on the part of the Government in as much as the Levee Board had properly appropriated the property and conveyed right-of-ways to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.260" offset="1869009">The Fifth Circuit also held that in any event under the provisions of Section 6 of Article XVI of the Louisiana Constitution, compensation was not allowed for a property used or destroyed for levee purposes where that property is situated on batture or in any event, it is not allowed where the property has not been assessed and the -- and the recovery is limited under that provision of the article of the Constitution which we will hereafter show as inapplicable to this case.But the Fifth Circuit applied that article of the Constitution in denying recovery to the petitioner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Donald Moseley</label>
            <text syncTime="520.863" offset="2083422">Well, sir, the Fifth Circuit held that the property was situated on batture and which is property between the ordinary low-water mark and the average high-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.617" offset="2122397">And that under the Louisiana constitutional provision, no compensation was allowed for a batture of property used or destroyed for levee purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.900" offset="2167536">As -- now here, I have to point out, we don't believe that that article has anything whatsoever to do with the present case.Our position is primarily that -- as I previously stated that there was no valid appropriation of this property by the Levee Board.And that in any event, the Government itself, directly through its own agencies, appropriated this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.049" offset="2288118">In order to ascertain just -- in -- and in as much as the Government relies upon certain actions which were taken by the Levee Board in this case, I think it would be well for me to briefly review just exactly what occurred with reference to this particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.622" offset="2366485">In 1928 and 1929, the Levee Board passed two general resolutions having relationship to no particular property in which they agreed to provide right-of-ways without cost to the Federal Government in connection with flood control projects and otherwise cooperate with the Government in accordance with the provisions of the federal Flood Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.975" offset="2463869">This resolution did not describe any specific properties and did not in and of itself attempt to appropriate any particular properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.840" offset="2503262">In May of 1947, the Louisiana State Department of Public Works wrote to the Levee Board that they had received plans from the United States engineers concerning an enlargement of an existing levee in that area and they recommended to the Government -- to the Levee Board that they cooperate with the Government in the execution of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.962" offset="2607752">Thereafter, on June the 10th, 1947, the United States engineers forwarded plans to the Levee Board and requested a statement that right-of-ways were -- were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.294" offset="2661146">It was said in the Government's letter that this statement could be in the form of a letter directed to United States engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.396" offset="2697509">Thereafter, the President of the Levee Board wrote to the United States engineers and advised him that he was happy to comply with their request.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.043" offset="2744111">The President of the Levee Board was purportedly acting under a resolution which had been adopted by the Levee Board some two years previous to this time in 1945 which authorized in -- in emergency situations, the President of the Levee Board to grant right-of-ways to the Government upon a letter without a prior meeting of the Board, but the resolution provided that the proper right-of-way resolution shall thereafter at the next meeting of the Board be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.462" offset="2877753">So, the President merely wrote this letter to the United States engineers advising that the right-of-ways were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.391" offset="2901473">In the -- at the next board meeting on July the 9th, 1947, the Board met but there was no action taken with reference to the letter which the President of the -- of the Levee Board had written other than a mention of the fact was made in the minutes that this letter had been written by the President of the Levee Board to the United States engineers, neither his in that letter nor any of the resolutions or anything else described any specific property.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.464" offset="3025816">It did not describe the property of the petitioner herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.797" offset="3043161">It did not provide any means of giving any type of notice to the property owners involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.863" offset="3131350">I -- as I recall it, there was no specific mention of any particular area at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.666" offset="3354645">As a matter of fact, I was coming to what the Levee Board attempted to do insofar as notice is concerned right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.316" offset="3381185">In June of 1947, on June the 20th, the Board requested from the assessor of Concordia Parish a list of property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.372" offset="3421414">Apparently, the assessor did not comply with their request.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.966" offset="3439804">And on July the 18th, 1947, another request was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.109" offset="3456418">Again, that he furnish a list of property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.917" offset="3471569">On the July the 31st, 1947, a list of property owners was furnished to the Levee Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.147" offset="3500513">The plaintiff's -- the petitioner's name was not upon this list in view of the fact that the property was not assessed, although their property was a matter of public record in the conveyance records, their property was not listed upon the assessment rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.026" offset="3564042">However, it would have been a relatively easy matter to have checked the conveyance records himself and ascertained whether or not plaintiff -- or who had any interest in this batture and in this timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.513" offset="3610018">In any event, notices -- written notices were not sent out by the Levee Board until October the 10th, 1947 which was, as I previously pointed out, several months after the work had already commenced on the plaintiff's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.099" offset="3688385">The first notice to plaintiff had -- that anything was going to happen to his property was when he was suddenly confronted with bulldozers in that area knocking over his timber, pushing it out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.807" offset="3739167">The -- it was -- the Government conceded that the only purpose -- that the purpose for this -- clearing this area was to obtain an area from which dirt could be obtained, a borrow pits, so as to increase -- enlarge the levee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.891" offset="3823491">The Government further conceded during the trial of the case that the only read -- that the Government plans and specifications themselves specifically provided for the destruction of this timber and that the reason for it was because it would affect a savings in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.912" offset="3899559">In other words, the Government, prior to the time any action was taken by the Levee Board, prior to the time the Levee Board had been communicated with, had made its own independent conclusion that this timber should be -- should be destroyed and it included it specifically in the plans and specifications in regard to this job, the contract was let upon the basis of destroying the timber.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.330" offset="9041293">Judge Dawkins is one of the more distinguished jurors in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.935" offset="9063654">He was formerly a Supreme Court Judge prior to -- going on the federal bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.148" offset="9096568">He was a member of the 1921 Louisiana Constitutional Convention at which the constitutional provisions were adopted, which are being -- which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.499" offset="9149962">He had a very long and distinguished career as a District Judge and we -- we in Louisiana consider him as not only one of the outstanding judges in our State but in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.060" offset="9192176">In addition to that, Judge Dawkins was the author of two of the landmark decisions involving this same type of controversy, the case of Tilden versus United States and the case of Wolfe versus Hurley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.989" offset="9251944">And we think that in view of all of those circumstances that Judge Dawkins' opinion was certainly entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.874" offset="9291442">If there was a man who was imminently qualified to pass upon the questions involving this case, it was certainly Judge Dawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.206" offset="9336790">Now, going back again briefly to the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.039" offset="9364062">It cited three cases, one in which I have discussed, the Danziger case in which specific notice was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.117" offset="9392379">The Court of Appeals also cited the Dickson case, a Louisiana Supreme Court case in which -- although it didn't involve this particular point, the courts held that the actions of these boards are subject to review when there has been impalpable abuse of their powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.457" offset="9461760">In the third case cited by the Court of Appeals, the Court found that there had been a substantial compliance with an act requiring notice as to the particular Levee Board involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.408" offset="9521528">But we take the position that the cases cited by the Court of Appeals actually support our view in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.610" offset="9562384">And that with cases cited in our brief, it probably show that as a matter of administrative practice, it has been the practice of Levee Boards throughout the State to forward where possible reasonable notice and an adequate opportunity to the landowner to remove his property prior to undertaking these various projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.064" offset="9644199">I might point out specifically the case of Board versus Kelly which is cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.612" offset="9686413">In that case, there are group of people who live on the batture around -- in Orleans Parish in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.725" offset="9726851">These people have no title to the property whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.211" offset="9740748">They're just merely squatters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.733" offset="9746913">They -- they build a little house along the batture and they then don't have to buy a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.158" offset="9776588">They -- they have their lot free of cost so they did up until this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.989" offset="9791948">These people nevertheless, a great number of them were occupying this batture area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.710" offset="9810756">They're called batture dwellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.474" offset="9825802">The Orleans Parish Levee Board proceeded to make a necessary arrangement to cooperate with the Federal Government in a levee improvement project to notify these batture owners to get off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.780" offset="9895079">They wouldn't get off and the State -- the Levee Board, rather than arbitrarily going on this property and just destroying it, have filed and did file a suit for a mandatory injunction requiring these people to remove their property before going ahead with the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.357" offset="9977417">And we think that on the basis of all of that, on the basis of the Louisiana decisions involving the right of appropriation, that there was clearly not a valid appropriation made by the Levee Board in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Billingsley Hill</label>
            <text syncTime="3616.490" offset="14465881">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.794" offset="14479151">This -- the subject matter of this case relates to a very basic principle in the body of law which Louisiana has developed to protect its citizens and property from destruction by the flood waters of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.439" offset="14537665">That first and basic principle as has been discussed here is that the State owns a servitude or easement for levee purposes on all repair in -- land repair into its navigable rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.878" offset="14595448">Now, petitioner concedes that servitude but seeks to deny its force and effectiveness by imposing legal limitations upon it which we insist are not required and that there is no authority for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.731" offset="14662844">Therefore, to meet that it's necessary -- necessary for me very briefly to review the origin and the scope and the source of the power and the compensability of that servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.094" offset="14728359">The servitude commenced in actions of the French crown in reserving the servitude from grants of property given in this French crown colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.504" offset="14793979">It was carried on through the reign of Spain and by express code provisions during territorial status and currently during statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.162" offset="14844552">The scope and extent has been judicially defined to include all property which is within the range of the reasonable necessity of the situation as produced by the forces of nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.903" offset="14891572">It includes lands, improvements, crops and trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.899" offset="14919576">Now, the power -- the source of the power of the servitude is not eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.846" offset="14947370">That is the taking from another, exercising the State's paramount domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.935" offset="14983732">In Louisiana, as elsewhere, exercise of eminent domain would require just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.413" offset="15013616">The State calls that power expropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.697" offset="15026782">That's eminent domain, it calls expropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.584" offset="15038276">It calls the exercise of this levee servitude and appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.805" offset="15059174">That is it appropriates to its own use property which already belongs to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.724" offset="15086864">That's the source of the power, ownership, not eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.165" offset="15108598">Now, prior to 1921 with the exception of an 1898 Act authorizing payment in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.958" offset="15143811">Prior to 1921, no compensation was ever allowed for the exercise of this -- of this property -- of this property right or servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.160" offset="15192607">In 1921, the Louisiana Constitution was revised and a limited gratuity was given to riparian owners for the exercise of this servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.523" offset="15254047">They were allowed the assessed value for the preceding year for their -- for their lands or improvement actually used or destroyed for levees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.204" offset="15300754">But that revision of the Constitution in 1921 expressly provided that this shall not include batture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.584" offset="15334296">Batture is the land for this purpose that lies between the levee and the river wherever the levee may be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.772" offset="15363030">The petitioner concedes that the -- that the land on which its timber stood is batture but avoids all of that law regarding the servitude by challenging the procedure used to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.411" offset="15437636">Specifically, that there was no notice -- advanced notice or advanced hearing accordingly and by challenging the reasonableness of using it to reduce the cost of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="3885.347" offset="15541290">I don't know as a matter of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.854" offset="15555396">I'm just not that familiar with Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.234" offset="15572846">Now, insistence on notice overlooks the plain and valid distinction between expropriation and appropriation in Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.935" offset="15623732">The Louisiana Constitution requires for the exercise of eminent domain, that is expropriation, that compensation be ascertained and paid -- be paid in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.575" offset="15678276">That would require an advanced notice of course and an advanced hearing, but this is not an expropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.879" offset="15707429">There is no requirement in Louisiana law requiring advanced notice or hearing for the use by the State of what it already owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.021" offset="15748075">For example, in Dickson versus Board of Commissioners by the Louisiana Supreme Court, it was said, "In Louisiana the State has the right to act first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.562" offset="15790184">That is the authority to appropriate such land to a use to which it is subject under its very title and talk later."</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.768" offset="15822994">In Pruyn versus Nelson Brothers, the Supreme Court of Louisiana said, "The law does not provide that the administrative officers shall follow any particular procedure in exercising the servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.014" offset="15872000">The customary way is to delegate to the contractor the right to remove the soil from the batture."</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.621" offset="15902407">Therefore, we maintain that no notice is required.If the riparian owner desires to challenge the reasonableness of the use, he may do so by suing the Levee Board subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.452" offset="15957786">Now, the question has been raised so repeatedly whether there are any Louisiana decisions which say notice is not required.</text>

            <text syncTime="4403.840" offset="17615308">And the second case is the Pruyn case, which my opponent has discussed and acknowledged, it relates to the notice question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.081" offset="17652297">That's the case in which they said the customary practice is for the contractor to delegate the servitude or the right to the contractor to enter directly on the property and remove the soil from the batture.</text>

            <text syncTime="4442.067" offset="17768176">The Federal Constitution does not require an advanced hearing even in the case of the exercise that they followed eminent domain.But in this case, for example, petitioner was accorded a hearing, of course, by this very suit and the only basis for his challenge that the use of the servitude was not reasonable is his charge that the property, the trees were not actually used in constructing the levee and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.023" offset="17888026">But they were -- and -- and he urges that the Government's defense that the -- that the trees were destroyed in this manner and as a means of reducing the cost of the project, he maintains is not a reasonable use or we maintain and we believe we're supported by decisions of this Court, United States ex rel.

            <text syncTime="5755.634" offset="23022446">And here's a question that Justice Cameron of the Fifth Circuit asked, "Can the United States Government without just compensation confiscate and destroy for its own monetary gain the valuable timber of appellee growing on the land of others basing its rights so to do on the claim that the lands are batture when state authorities have taken no official action and made no minute entry towards exercising the servitude against the land or the timber and have taken no steps at all to that end beyond giving written notice to the landowners?"</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.021" offset="23168000">And that was not given, if Your Honors please, until the timber was practically all destroyed and no notice was ever given to the owner of this timber.</text>
