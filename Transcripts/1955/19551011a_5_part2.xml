            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Up to the recess, I had tried in a few brief minutes to tell the Court what 30 witnesses said what over 600 exhibits say, that's of course necessarily only a summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.435" offset="113685">We had most detailed proof on this phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.157" offset="132598">And if you will look at our brief at the appendix page 9A, you will find summarized there a number of the key findings which the District Court made concerning the inter product competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.994" offset="191948">I direct the Court's attention particularly to the finding 838 on page 9A and to the findings which come immediately at the sequence after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.192" offset="280764">Now, as to price, the -- the Court said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.910" offset="319634">“Competitive influences in the flexible packaging markets place limitation upon du Pont's pricing policies and procedures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="93.906" offset="375536">They force reduction of du Pont's prices and deny it power to raise prices in the manner of a monopolist.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerhard A. Gesell</label>
            <text syncTime="105.158" offset="420571">From record 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.666" offset="446589">If you will turn to page 19A of our appendix again, you will see set forth there many of the key findings concerning prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.658" offset="518583">Thus, the Court said that under market conditions which prevail, du Pont doesn't posses power to raise prices without regard to competitive pressures, and that the market would penalize any attempt to do so with lower sales and smaller profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.113" offset="592353">The detailed quotations from record 301 at the bottom of that page are illustrative of the price competition and there are other findings on the pages immediately follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.856" offset="655360">The Court refers to the fact that cellophane prices have not been arbitrary and noncompetitive and found specifically that we did not have the power to price in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.261" offset="720980">Now, what is the Government's answer to this?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.310" offset="741146">It is I think an answer that can only be made by someone who has not a detailed knowledge of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.366" offset="777404">The Government says there's a price gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.047" offset="796108">It says that here are some -- the prices of glassine and wax paper low in level and here is the price of cellophane and higher than that is the price of film such as Pliofilm and polyethylene.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.606" offset="874371">And it says that accordingly as a matter of theory, it's obvious that du Pont is in a price market by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.068" offset="912196">The findings of the Court are all for the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.447" offset="933721">The lower price goods which were the big volume sellers, the dominant goods on the packages, the pack -- the goods that were the major items that each of these end users were lower priced and the whole history of du Pont's price at the time it got into this business in 1923 has been the reduce price, to reduce price, to reduce price, to reduce price, to get down to where it is able better to compete with the lower priced waxings and glass papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.421" offset="1077603">And the Court found that with every one of those price reductions, du Pont was able to increase the sales of its cellophane and did found also that there was a high degree of cross elasticity of demand between the ratio of these prices and that as the cellophane price is reduced, its sales were improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.892" offset="1191497">The Government tends very much to over emphasize the importance of this price gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.404" offset="1217515">It makes a difference of two and a half meals on a local bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.843" offset="1247295">It makes the difference between the higher and the lower prices, the range is in about one cent per 1000 square inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.678" offset="1286687">The prices are close and close in degree, and they're made closer --</text>

            <text syncTime="393.956" offset="1575811">Now, in addition, these -- these products you see are important to the user, not always in their raw form but in terms of what it cost after they have been processed, after they've been prepared for a package, after they've been printed in a manner of these converted items which I showed to the members the Court before the recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.927" offset="1663687">And the record shows that there is really what you would call a spectrum of prices, of -- of whole range of prices in close proximity to each other depending on what materials are combined, how they are processed, what type of material is used and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.290" offset="1733068">And then of course, cutting across this is also the problem of quality and -- and it may be that in a particular material with a slightly higher price, one can get and a -- a greater composite of quality advantages and a greater value.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.611" offset="1802344">But the inter product competition price wise is sharp and continuous and the findings are that it was intense and the findings are that businesses' loss and gain by reason of this price competition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerhard A. Gesell</label>
            <text syncTime="480.554" offset="1922194">The record doesn't show that, but I think we could compute it because we know what the total cellophane sales were for bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.879" offset="1951451">The -- the interesting thing about the bread situation, Mr. Justice Black that shows the -- the closeness of this, is shown by the record in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.244" offset="2000875">The record shows that as the price of flour change, and therefore the price of the bread to the baker went up or down.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.896" offset="2043507">That was often the determining factors to whether we stayed with cellophane and went to wax paper or whether we went to glassine, similarly in the candy bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.946" offset="2079765">As the cost of the raw ingredients change, many of these user, not all of them but many of them would shift back and forth due to these economic factors because this difference was so slight in their margin of profit that they were very conscious of this price differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.448" offset="2153744">But in every one of these end users that we've been looking at, people side by side are using different materials for the same use.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.142" offset="2192509">It is possible to go into a supermarket and see bread wrapped in glassine and wax paper side by side selling to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.868" offset="2239425">And these price findings which were the end result of the Court's analysis of all this material, in our judgment conclusively show as a matter of specific fact that there was no power to raise, there was no power to obtain predetermined rates of profit or to price arbitrarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.669" offset="2326674">du Pont was forced to lower its price and it was forced to keep its price low by this competition and it's clear if it raised its price, it would lose business and lose profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.271" offset="2381009">And I think that's the answer to the price leadership argument that you've heard this morning.It's one thing to have a price leadership where you have lets say two companies, one with 75% and one 25% and whichever way, the 75% produced or goes the other follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.083" offset="2456242">If the man with 75% has freedom of action to price as he chooses, but if his price is dictated by competitive factors, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.957" offset="2507755">I submit for the best competition from cellophane or competition from some other material, because what we're concerned with is the existence and the continuation of the kind of competitive economy which the Sherman Act is designed to promote and encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.952" offset="2583719">And these competitive influences and pressure from other materials have -- have on the findings which are conceded, deprived upon of that freedom of power over price which one might surmise existed otherwise at some given percentage whatever that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.553" offset="2662191">Of course, even in the field of cellophane, we have analyzed the evidence in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.343" offset="2681313">I don't intend to deal with that now, but to show on the Court's findings in the field of cellophane standing alone the power of a price is not established, as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.925" offset="2739618">Now, that -- unless there are some questions from anyone in the Court that covers the Section of my argument, concerned with power over price and I -- I wanted to turn next and deal with the other major power that we're concerned within the case, the power to exclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.144" offset="3788487">Your question presumes that price is the only factor that determines whether a person buys a Ford or a Cadillac and I dare say in our own individual experience that may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.456" offset="3845747">I'm sure I would buy a Cadillac instead of a Ford if I could afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.724" offset="3862883">But that is not what the buyers and the sellers said in this market who are buying flexible packaging materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.768" offset="3890991">There, we move out of the realm of our individual experience and we have to accept proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.816" offset="3915233">And the proof was, that the buyers and sellers consider price an important factor, but not the only factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.277" offset="3945012">They consider also quality and the combination of properties, the degree of moisture proof protection, the machine running characteristics, the expense at which it can be processed and a whole series of factors and that what they buy is a price quality combination and they look for the optimum degree of quality in these combinations that they can find for a given price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.212" offset="4076774">Now, glassine, two and a half times is again not a correct position on the market entirely because many glassine sold right up at the level of cellophane, seeking to get at those combination of properties which were particularly true of cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.310" offset="4161202">So that in the market, where you have this price quality combination type of competition, the price wasn't the only decisive factor and if two men of bakers in a given town, put out their white bread to the tray and one is taking cellophane and the other is taking glassine, I don't think you can any longer theorize that these -- that there is a difference, appreciable difference in a distinctive market present on the basis of the disparity of price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.259" offset="5872953">So, they tend the issue it seems to me, unless you say as a matter of law it -- it rides against all other evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.612" offset="5906390">But you see I say there's another link in this, Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.519" offset="5922064">You have to show a causal relation between your position and your agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.931" offset="5955709">You can't just read the agreement and say, by its terms, it excluded and therefore, that causes your position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.983" offset="5987892">We're not litigating whether or not it's a restraint under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.672" offset="6002625">There's no Section 1 charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.531" offset="6010044">So, you have to -- to litigate a Section 2 (k) particularly with agreements dead and gone and buried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.361" offset="6037420">You've got to show some causal relation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.364" offset="6057378">Let me see if I can illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.137" offset="6064483">This entire business was built on moistureproof cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.371" offset="6085381">There wasn't any business without moistureproof cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.060" offset="6100219">Moistureproof cellophane on the Court's findings and in fact is a wholly different, unique important product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.787" offset="6135118">It was invented and discovered solely by du Pont with no contribution from anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.128" offset="6160509">We had a broad concededly valid product patent and that was in existence from 1929 up until a year before the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.066" offset="6224248">Now, no one could sell into this country any moistureproof cellophane until that patent stood in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.914" offset="6263641">No one could manufacture moistureproof cellophane, because that patent stood in the way and the French product was a -- was a mere frill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.494" offset="6305959">It was used to wrap perfume bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.365" offset="6321424">It was a gadget to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.531" offset="6330096">It had nothing to do with our modern packaging markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.616" offset="6350367">It couldn't be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.538" offset="6354129">We tried to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.424" offset="6357682">It was no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.274" offset="6361025">People wouldn't buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.801" offset="6367190">It broke, it stuck, get gummed up and let moisture through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.054" offset="6380147">It was nothing and we invented this new product and we had a patent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.679" offset="6406687">Now, can you still say, “Owe it back in 1923, there was an agreement that kept someone out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.319" offset="6433228">The thing that kept anybody out of this business if anything did keep them out was not an agreement but the supervening fact of an important patent, as the Court found and there's no causal relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.116" offset="6492369">Anymore, there would be a causal -- we -- we litigated very heavily, Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.732" offset="6506893">The question is to whether or not prices were fixed in the argentine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.246" offset="6972918">And so naturally, people from those companies came and took the stand and testified and documents concerning the dealings with them were analyzed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.182" offset="7064660">And I propose to that if I may say so, when we were dealing with this important secret process that they're talking about, which they say was the act of monopolization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.632" offset="7118472">They said our agreements with the French were illegal, because there was no bona fide secret process that it was all a sham and a delusion that we had divided these markets and there wasn't any proper process and we litigated that issue out and the Court found that it was an important process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.322" offset="7189211">And now the Government says, “You see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.258" offset="7196944">It was apparently important process and they are monopolist because they acquired it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.351" offset="7217319">And I suggest that -- that any -- any fair question of how you litigate a case would show that that argument is simply made up for the purposes of argument and hasn't any substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.251" offset="7260996">We were confronted with the same thing in prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.277" offset="7269042">We were claimed to be a monopolist that we raised prices, that the lowered prices, that you kept prices the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.472" offset="10937887">I first want to say something about the question of the continuation of the restraint imposed by the original contract with La Cellophane against manufacture in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.965" offset="10999850">The agreement provided that La Cellophane would give du Pont an unqualified and unrestricted and exclusive right to every process relating to cellophane manufactured, owned by La Cellophane or which it may hereafter acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.465" offset="11101832">And it's conferred upon du Pont the exclusive right to manufacture cellophane in North and Central America.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.451" offset="11293780">We construe these provisions, these agreements as imposing no restrictions upon the sale of regenerated cellulose in any country in which the public is free to sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.855" offset="12503353">This obviously has reference only on the question of transparency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.809" offset="12539193">On the first page, the only one that is clear is Pliofilm which is a film, in other words, not a product.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.449" offset="12593737">The paper one at the -- at the bottom are obviously not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.452" offset="12621740">Then, we come to the fourth page and here we do see a paper product which is quite clear, but I suggest that the Court members, the Court just lift up a little sheet of paper over the wax paper, maybe an inch then look at the red thing underneath and do the same with cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.327" offset="12729260">One case is perfectly clear in the other case it's so murky you could just barely make out the outline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.475" offset="12761861">Another thing, just take your thumb nail, likely scratch it across this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.113" offset="12796447">Nothing -- it's of -- it's cellophane paper, in effect even the slightest, it leaves a permanent blur on the wax paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.346" offset="12841378">Now, on the question of physical characteristic, difference between physical characteristic, cellophane is different from glassine and this -- this is all in the basis of the Court's finding and clarity, tear strength, bursting strength, premium ability -- permeability to gases, dimensional change with humidity difference, resistance to grease and oil and for two of the three types of glassine and water absorption and moisture permeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.656" offset="13038550">Those facts are brought up at page 78 and 79 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.957" offset="13071778">Wax paper is different from cellophane in nine of the 11 physical characteristic properties set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.525" offset="13110021">Also, at page 45 of our brief, you'll see set of -- a little column near the bottom, the differences between cellophane and sulphite paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.804" offset="13191210">Now, the -- so, I don't think there can be the possible question as to this being a -- really, a totally different product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.121" offset="13240424">The question is whether competition from the lower level so to speak really controls cellophane's price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.462" offset="13289848">The facts are incontestable on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.148" offset="13312522">Cellophane, when it was way above the price was increasing its sales and having high profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.152" offset="13344601">Its price was not controlled by the lower price products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.892" offset="13367484">It shows to drop the price from time to time, get a larger market, partly from new users, partly from the old users that would reduce manufacturing cost and the increase value of lower manufacturing cost would also increase profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.140" offset="13460480">I think very little has been said if anything by Mr. Gesell about what the du Pont management thought about the competition of these paper products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.085" offset="13512307">It's never been explained why the du Pont management, the top management left them out of consideration when it was considering cellophane's competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.316" offset="13553162">If they control cellophane's price, why wasn't that the major consideration?</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.372" offset="13589420">It's never been satisfactorily explained why cellophane forged ahead as it did, if it did not materially differ functionally from any other competing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.302" offset="13661205">The -- these material differences enabled a monopolist of the product to exercise a degree of pricing power over that product which is certainly within the reach of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.797" offset="13739154">The monopolist has a wide range when this other products or maybe two and half times under its price, think of the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.990" offset="13795892">It practically as if they didn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.352" offset="13813342">Of course, there would be some uses where as I said in my opening, customers will fluctuate because they will compare one product which is different in character or for certain advantages against another offering less advantage but lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.519" offset="13909995">And of course, a numerable findings about how customers shifted back and forth are we think irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.137" offset="13980526">Something was said that -- near the end Mr. Gesell's argument that Sylvania did compete with du Pont in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.209" offset="14028800">I take issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.651" offset="14086583">I think it is whatever this system might before it would be found if anywhere in -- in -- oh, yes, in du Pont, in the appendix to du Pont's brief under the heading as to existence of price competition with Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.775" offset="14203089">Well, if you look at that, all that you find is they quoted a finding with -- same with the -- after January 1, 1947 of a price differences in following respects without noticing the respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.210" offset="14296816">Two of the respects were that Sylvania had a higher price at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.731" offset="14314893">That was a -- in a condition as severe undersupplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.409" offset="14333597">It was a terrific seller's market and for short period during 1947, Sylvania's price was higher than du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.404" offset="14377587">That is not price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.006" offset="14411964">I'm not talking about after the period of the monopolization charge in 1950 and 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.433" offset="14453656">The other earlier reference about numerous occasions, it was competition between Sylvania and du Pont's basic price just refers to be sporadic apertures by Sylvania from this list price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.798" offset="14519171">And the Court found -- the Court found that each time du Pont issues a new price list, Sylvania copies its list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.462" offset="14553757">There isn't the slightest question in the world that in any realistic sense there was never any price competition on the part of Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.958" offset="14595762">Thank you.</text>
