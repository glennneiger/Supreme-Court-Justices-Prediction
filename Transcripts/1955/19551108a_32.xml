            <label>Mr. Gerard H. Schreiber</label>
            <text syncTime="17.390" offset="69486">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.083" offset="80248">If Your Honors please, this case, the case of the State of Louisiana versus John Michel and the case that is immediately following this, the case of the State of Louisiana versus Labat and Poret are both petitions to the Louisiana Supreme Court for writs of certiorari from capital convictions for the crimes of aggravative rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.702" offset="206785">In both of these cases, the defendants are Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.192" offset="232699">In both of these cases, the -- the prosecuting witnesses were in one case, the case of John Michel, a young white lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.077" offset="280242">In the case of the State of Louisiana versus Labat and Poret, it was an older white lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.646" offset="322560">Now, in both of these cases, the defendants, through their counsel filed motions to quash their indictments and both of them haven't been indicted by the grand jury for the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.268" offset="392986">Both of them filed motions to quash the indictments on the ground that there had been a systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand juries in the Parish of Orleans since time memorable and from these particular grand juries that indicted these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.548" offset="494132">In both of these cases, we stood ready to prove that the population of the City of New Orleans which is coextensive with the Parish of Orleans is approximately one-third Negro, consisting of some 230,000 people -- 230,000 Negroes of which there were countless numbers that were prominent, educated, businessmen and professional men.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.114" offset="632372">And countless numbers of whom they had been educated in elementary schools, high schools and universities of which we had a -- have a Negro University in the City of the Orleans since 1869.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.986" offset="695902">Having filed our motions to quash in both of these cases, the State filed demurrer to our motions to quash on the grounds that the motions to quash were filed too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.209" offset="756820">And in both of the cases, the State's demurrer was sustained and we were denied the opportunity and the right to offer our evidence in support of our motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.399" offset="821499">And in both of these cases, if Your Honor -- Honors please, we are here complaining that that action has denied to our clients, the defendants in these particular cases the due process of law that's guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.487" offset="901851">Now, if Your Honors please --</text>

            <text syncTime="235.567" offset="942184">The fact -- now, I answer it in this way, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.946" offset="955768">The fact that there has been a systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand juries in the Parish of Orleans is a judicially admitted and proven fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.570" offset="1010207">Just recently, as a matter of fact, a motion to quash such as this was sustained by one of the -- the trial judges for the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.486" offset="1061930">It is judicially admitted and it's judicially proven that there has been such a systematic exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.898" offset="1107592">We only got as far as to file our motion to quash to which the demurrer was filed, the demurrer was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.064" offset="1140193">We did not get to offer -- offer (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.668" offset="1154612">Well, if you had been appointed a month ahead, the counsel had been appointed a month ahead and it had ample opportunity to make the motion and had not made it, then you would have no question as to the validity of the trial by -- by a jury would you?</text>

            <text syncTime="307.758" offset="1230994">You mean, presuming -- presuming that there was a sufficient amount of time alloted to counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.255" offset="1260983">If Your Honor pleases, the best way that I can answer that is to cite to Your Honors, in which I propose to do in the case of Powell versus Alabama, wherein this Court had said that not only does the defendant have the right to counsel but he also has the right to effective counsel appointed at a time and under such circumstances whereby the counsel is going to render to that particular defendant the effect of aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.232" offset="1392849">Now, of course, one of these cases are -- is going to come up involving a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.737" offset="1426913">In our particular case, the time interval is an extremely sharp interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.002" offset="1447915">And all of this time, question arises by virtue of the fact that Article 202 of our Code of Criminal Procedure in the State of Louisiana provides in substance that attacks on the grand jury or a petit jury must be urged before the expiration of the third judicial day of the term for which the jury has been impaneled of the term --</text>

            <text syncTime="397.881" offset="1591484">Assuming that your argument assumes that if you had made it in time, it would have been taken.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerard H. Schreiber</label>
            <text syncTime="428.029" offset="1712065">Well, then we -- we're (Voice Overlap) saying that first of all, this man at that time, when his time was running out, we say that he did not have an attorney by virtue of the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.511" offset="1765982">And we say secondly, that if Your Honors feel that he did have an attorney, then by no means he -- did he have an attorney who was rendering to him the effect of aid, both of which falls within the purview of the Powell versus Alabama case, which set both of those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.295" offset="1853127">Now, if Your Honor -- Honors please, the -- the time interval, the date sequence in this particular case is applying of crime importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.455" offset="1893773">This crime is allegedly had been committed on February the 10th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.449" offset="1917701">The defendant, John Michel was arrested on or about February the 13th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.903" offset="1955527">He was indicted by the grand jury on or about February the 19th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.555" offset="1990217">He was initially brought up for arraignment two judicial days following the return of his indictment on February the 23rd, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.710" offset="2034834">Now, I'd like to deviate here to tell you just a little bit something about the grand jury for the Parish of Orleans, the grand juries for the Parish of Orleans are selected to serve for a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.722" offset="2094811">There's one of them that's impaneled in September to serve until the following March and then a new grand jury is in impaneled to serve from March until September.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.334" offset="2137234">Now, in this particular case, this was the grand jury that had been selected in September 1952 to serve until March 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.612" offset="2182374">Now, this man was indicted by that grand jury on February the 19th, shortly before their term was expiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.439" offset="2217691">He was brought up on February the 23rd, 1953, two judicial days following the return of his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.172" offset="2248620">At that particular time, he was asked by Judge Hertz, the trial judge, if he was represented by a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.685" offset="2282684">He told he was not and he -- Judge Hertz asked him, was he going to be able to employ counsel and he told the judge that he thought that his family was going to be able to get money to employ a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.479" offset="2341825">So Judge Hertz continued the arraignment until the following Monday, February 23rd was a Monday, and he continued the arraignment until March the 2nd the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.994" offset="2391876">Now, just so happened that on that particular Monday, March the 2nd, the term of that grand jury was expiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.246" offset="2420924">That was their last day in office and a new grand jury was being impaneled on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.683" offset="2442658">Now, during the course of this ensuing wait, when Judge Hertz continued this arraignment, he discussed with me whether I will take the case and I told him if I could help the Court, I would take the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.620" offset="2498456">However, he didn't appoint me, he merely discussed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.267" offset="2512980">On March the 2nd, and incidentally I'm not deviating from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.352" offset="2537326">If Your Honors please, this is all born out by the record.On March the 2nd, this man was brought up again for arraignment and I have to be sitting down in court on other business.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.322" offset="2581211">And the judge asked him, had he been able to employ a counsel and he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.719" offset="2602841">So the judge pointing to me, he says -- well, he says, “I'm going to appoint Mr. Schreiber to represent you."</text>
            <text syncTime="657.443" offset="2629695">The judge had also told me that he was going to appoint several attorneys in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.381" offset="2649443">So nothing further happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.064" offset="2664176">The judge, he recites solely in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.309" offset="2681208">The judge continued the arraignment himself for another week until the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.451" offset="2705763">He continued the arraignment because he said that -- I had said that I didn't know anything about the case which I did not and that he wanted to give me time to look into the case and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.380" offset="2745469">So he continued the arraignment for one week, five judicial days after that.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.554" offset="2918191">He -- he tells the -- the clerk to send him a notice and a notice is sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.159" offset="2944627">Now, in this particular case, the judge said I am going to appoint Mr. Schreiber and myself, I received my written notice on March the 5th.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.693" offset="9574713">I was appointed by Judge Hertz after court had adjoined at about 1:30 on the afternoon of Friday, March the 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.096" offset="9628317">It has been our contention that until Judge Hertz made his final appointment of counsel that actually we weren't under any duty to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.651" offset="9670531">Now, since I was appointed on the fourth judicial day following the term if we are accept -- or if we are to accept the Wilson decision as being correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.134" offset="9772513">And before I start into my main argument, I'd like to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question which he put to Mr. Schreiber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.463" offset="9809816">Is it a fact that the courts and lawyers at taking judicial notice of the fact that there has been systematic exclusion of Negroes from grand juries in the Parish of Orleans.</text>

O'Hara's charge to the present grand jury in which he states in part and I'll make this very brief, “Every grand jury selected in Orleans -- Orleans Parish within the memory of man has been an all White grand jury.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.403" offset="10529541">Article 202, ”All objections to the manner of selecting or drawing any juror or jury or to any defect or irregularity that can be pleaded against any array or venire must be filed, pleaded, heard or urged before the expiration of the third judicial day of the term for which said jury shall have been drawn, etcetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.702" offset="10638733">For 50 years or more prior to the Wilson case, the statute meant what it said that all motions to quash must be filed, pleaded or urged before the expiration of the third judicial day of the term which said jury shall had been drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.346" offset="10701322">That is if the grand jury's term started on the first of the month, then all objections must be made before the end of the third day of that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.682" offset="10738625">If a man was indicted after the third day of the grand jury's term, then there were other articles in the Louisiana Criminal Code which would govern a situation, those articles being numbers 284, 286, and 287.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.609" offset="10806335">All of which are quoted in our brief on page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.417" offset="10833607">The Supreme Court of Louisiana, however, stated for the first time in the Wilson case and then repeated its opinion in our case that Article 202 meant that all objections to a jury or jurors must be made before the expiration of the third judicial day following the expiration of the grand jury's term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.025" offset="10932036">And in the case now before Your Honors, the Supreme Court has made the same ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.186" offset="10956696">We submit that the language of Article 202 is clear that it permits of no other meaning except that the third day of the grand jury's term means the third day from the day the term started and not the third day after the term has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.247" offset="11024927">I got a notice from this -- from the clerk of this Honorable Court that this case would be argued on the 8th day of November.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.464" offset="11053767">The language was clear and here we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.171" offset="11068604">Suppose, Your Honors, we had appeared here on December the 8th and you'd say, "Well, where were you, Mr. Schreiber?</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.250" offset="11104967">We said -- we'd tell you, “Well, Your Honors, on the Louisiana interpretation of this language we had a right to be here on December the 8th.”</text>
