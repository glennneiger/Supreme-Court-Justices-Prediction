            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="15.778" offset="63112">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.595" offset="70322">I think at the outset, it's important to try and determine just what the issue is -- how it got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.896" offset="107520">The issue is really a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.614" offset="118387">Mobile and United -- United is a natural gas pipe line and Mobile, a local gas distributing company in the City of Mobile, entered into a contract in 1946 whereby, United agreed to furnish Mobile all the gas needed by it for a particular resale with the Ideal Cement Company at a fix rate for a period of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.067" offset="228206">In 1953, United, by unilateral action of filing a schedule of higher rates, sought to increase the contract rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.647" offset="282540">The issue is whether, under the Natural Gas Act, a contract between two utility companies for the sale of gas at a fixed rate for a term of years maybe aggregated unilaterally, by the natural gas company by the mere act of filling a schedule of increase or whether the contract is valid and binding between the parties until and unless it has been set aside by the Federal Power Commission after a hearing and finding by the Commission that the contract is against the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.651" offset="450560">The case gets -- reaches this Court under the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.898" offset="475533">As I said, this contract was entered into in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.293" offset="493087">It was a modification of an earlier contract entered into in 1936, the modification downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.363" offset="521404">United agreed to sell this gas for the resale to the Ideal Cement Company at a special low rate, so that Mobile could make a contract in turn with the Ideal Cement Company, the new company in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.828" offset="591308">When United filed its schedule to increase the rates under Section 4 (d) of the Act -- I'll go into the meaning of the Section a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.852" offset="639373">Mobile filed a petition with the Federal Power Commission alleging that its contract rate could not be changed by a mere filing and asking that the filing be rejected and without prejudice, of course, to a hearing under 5 (a) as to the reasonableness of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.806" offset="715128">The Commission denied our petition and dismissed our proceeding, so that the rate went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.501" offset="753998">There was some talk yesterday as to the fact that it went into effect without suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.993" offset="771971">That's not really material to the main issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.081" offset="788271">We don't like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.364" offset="793391">We would like to have it suspended but in the other case, it will be argued in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.112" offset="808438">There was a suspension and the same issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.464" offset="817842">The question is not whether it can be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.540" offset="830067">The question is whether the rate can be changed before the contract has been itself found to be against the public interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="216.638" stopTime="221.376">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="216.638" offset="866534">Well if it can be suspended, there is time to make that determination, if it cannot -- there isn't.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="221.376" offset="885447">Well sir, that determination, the real -- when we come to discussing the statute, I will point out that the real question we had here on statutory construction is, that when you construe the statute carefully you'll find that in a hearing commenced by a filing under 4 (d), you never reach the question of the reasonableness of the contract because Section 4 (d) and (e) merely authorized the Commission to have all the hearing and pass upon the reasonableness of the proposed new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.836" offset="1019298">And when you come to study the Act, I think it can easily be seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.192" offset="1032673">As the courts below held that the proposed new rates might be reasonable and therefore, would have to be approve in a 4 (d) proceeding even though the contract rate was also reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.802" offset="1083141">And it's for that reason, that we insist and the courts below agreed for this, that you cannot touch a contract rate until after the contract has been found unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.257" offset="1124937">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="284.473" offset="1137789">So that a suspension under 4 (e) gives us five months less time during which our contract is being violated but in the end, the rate can still be increased as it was in the other case even though I think it's easily demonstrable there that the contract rate was perfectly reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.771" offset="1335066">But Section 4 is the Act provides for the filling of rates by a Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.697" offset="1358785">It's printed at page 101 of Mr. Wahrenbrock's brief where he read from it yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.355" offset="1381355">4 (c) provides that under such rules and regulations the Commission may prescribed every natural gas company shall file with the Commission within 60 days of the passage of the Act.All schedules showing all -- schedules showing all rates and at the bottom together with all contracts, which in any manner, affect or relate to such rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.258" offset="1564944">Let me explain what 4 means here, and I think I can answer Your Honors question.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.538" offset="1590126">4 (d) -- well 4 (c) says if there's a contract, it must be filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.967" offset="1675807">In other words, that provision prevents the parties to a contract from secret of changing their rates by amending their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.860" offset="1703393">They've got to tell the Commission before they can change the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.496" offset="1717917">Mr. Wahrenbrock says, “That's the provision that authorizes the company to unilaterally change the rate because it says no company may -- natural gas company may not change a contract rate without 30 days notice, because that means they can change it unilaterally with 30 days notice."</text>
            <text syncTime="449.557" offset="1798165">Well obviously, you can't change a contract unilaterally and this is very clearly specified in the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.847" offset="2039327">If the parties themselves have negotiated a change then, the natural gas company files the propose new contract rate under 4 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="518.890" offset="2075481">Then the Commission, where it can suspend -- suspends, where it cannot lets it go into effect and holds a hearing if there's anything wrong with the new rate, obviously, they want to see whether the parties got together and put in an exorbitant rate for their own purposes, or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.680" offset="2134622">So the Commission then looks at the increase contract rate just as it looks at any rate increase.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.473" offset="2181851">For the simple reason that a contract, every congressman knows that a contract means that a contract can't be changed unilaterally and when they said you can't change a contract rate without notice, Congress assume that of course previously the change had been agreed to between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.094" offset="2244336">This Court so held in the case many years ago in a Kansas statute that a provision of this kind was a notice provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.472" offset="2333884">In order words of the new rate not the lawfulness of the change but the new rate and if after a hearing -- during a hearing, it can suspend except it can't suspend these commercial resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.181" offset="2392712">There was so much talk about it yesterday, I'll give you the reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.471" offset="2409848">At the hearings before Congress, the congressman who was proposing this provision, Congressman Lee stated just what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.347" offset="2457287">He said why resale contracts for industrial use only -- resales for industrial only are usually embodied in short-term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.425" offset="2513607">And those don't have to be suspended and the reason they don't have to be suspended is that if they're binding contracts, the rate can't be change for both parties have agreed so there's no reason to suspend it.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.702" offset="2570762">And anyway, that's its effect, but we're not concerned and perhaps they shouldn't digress about the suspending question, it doesn't help as much.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.478" offset="3245871">They always have contracts for industrial sales, and if they have contracts and the contracts are binding, as I think they clearly are, there's no need to suspend the change when the buyer has agreed to the change.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.789" offset="3307102">Now in 5 (a) provides that whenever the -- the Commission, after a hearing, had it by its own motion or on complaint shall find that at any rate charge, skip down all contract affecting such rate is at page 103 (Inaudible) shall find that at any rate, all contract affecting such rate is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.214" offset="3448790">In other words, Congress said, “If there's anything wrong with the contract or an existing rate, the Commission shall hold hearings and if it is the contract rate or the existing rate just the filed rate, is unduly discriminatory or preferential, or exorbitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.119" offset="3520470">If there's anything wrong with it, then, they may set it aside, and we maintain that that is a delegation by Congress to the Federal Power Commission, authority of Congress to abrogate contract when the public interest requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.085" offset="3584313">That it is an exclusive delegation of power and that there cannot be any delegation of power to the natural gas company to change its contract by a mere filing under Section 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.288" offset="3973120">And this Court said, “No, you can't operate under the contract.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.157" offset="4008542">I'm reading now from pages 14 and 15 of my brief in the Armour case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.370" offset="4025469">There is no provision in the Interstate Commerce Act for the filling of contracts with shippers, and no method of making them public defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.651" offset="4058593">If the rates are subject to secret alteration by special agreement, then, the statute would fail of its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.959" offset="4083775">To establish a rate known to work and then in answer to Armour's suggestion that it would be a good thing to allow contracts in some portions of the railroad industry, this Court said, “It may be that such contracts should be recognized giving stability for limited periods that the contracts being filed, and published, and the rate stipulated known an opened wall, no injustice would be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.327" offset="4185234">But as we have said, such considerations address themselves to Congress not to the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.470" offset="5025855">It had a contract, Tyler Distributing Company, in the City of Tyler, a contract just as Mobile had a contract with the same petitioner, United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.111" offset="5072353">Tyler had a franchise with the City of Tyler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.683" offset="5086668">The franchise expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.734" offset="5094922">Well some citizens of the City of Tyler went to the downfall and said, “We can get you cheaper gas and the company is getting from United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.855" offset="5127419">So the Tyler Company went to United and said, “We're going to lose this business and as you can lower the rates,” and United said, “Alright we'll give you rates -- such a rate much lower for the duration of your new franchise, otherwise, you won't get the franchise 15 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.716" offset="5190844">The City follows the Tyler -- wrote a letter to United and said, “Before we grant the franchise we want you to tell us, the governing body of the City of Tyler, that you're going to abide by this contract for its terms and that if we take over the distributing business, you'll sell to us for the same price, otherwise, we're going to give the gas to these newcomers have found a well near the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.291" offset="5277153">Mr. Fletcher's client agreed and wrote a letter saying, “Yes we'll not charge more than this amount,” and they got the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.935" offset="5307664">Now by the same increase, it applies to us, they just said, “Oh well, we're going to increase it now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.089" offset="5336294">And when I ask in the argument below whether they've been trying to put one over on a good citizens of Tyler, let's say, they don't know, they were actually in good faith at that time, they believe the contract was binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.607" offset="5386344">But now they've looked at the books and think they can get out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.392" offset="5397525">Now our case presents another things of these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.290" offset="5417064">This question of sales -- for resale for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.294" offset="5441097">Ideal Cement Company bought an aluminum plant in the City of Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.438" offset="5457711">The question was, was it going to establish and turn it into a cement plant in Mobile for the benefit of everybody in Mobile and United, or, was it going to remove the profiteer to its own plant elsewhere and the Ideal Cement Company said to Mobile Distributing Company, "If you can guarantee us gas at 12 cents per MCF by the cubic feet for 10 years, we will develop a plant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.972" offset="5571814">So Mobile wrote to United and United agreed in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.639" offset="5586547">That's the contract I'm talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.696" offset="5594697">You may sell -- we will sell gas to you for resale to Ideal for 10 years at 12 cents -- you may resale to them at 12 cents and pay us 90% of that, which meant 1.3 we paid to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.871" offset="5675468">Then we got the contract and the Ideal Cement Company opened up its plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.822" offset="5703262">Now they're trying to violate that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.895" offset="5715487">Now the very interesting thing has happened since this case began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.462" offset="5737848">United has undertaken to induce my client Mobile and its other local -- and the local industrial consumers to let them take our contracts by assignments so they're not carrying out the very same contract that they've tried to abrogate in this proceeding by selling directly to the Ideal Cement Company except they pay us two cents for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.168" offset="5848607">In other words, they get even less under this arrangement and they did it under a contract and we get a little more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.667" offset="5866580">We get 2 cents instead of 1.03 cents and they only get 10 cents instead of 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.929" offset="5891657">I was very much surprise when I learned this and I stated in my brief that I couldn't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.378" offset="5913496">My attention was called to some cases that this Court had in which the Panhandle Company was trying to take over the Ford business in Detroit by direct sales and another business in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.068" offset="5968248">And this Court, in those cases, pointed out that what they were trying to do was to take off the cream of the business and get it away from the local distributing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.385" offset="6005447">And get it into their own hands which would increase the cost of gas to local consumers because the distributing company is depending on their industrial sales to make their business functional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.182" offset="6056647">Now at the hearing before the Federal Power Commission at which this assignment contract that I just spoke of was being presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.356" offset="6097398">Mr. Fletcher's client presented one of its officials to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.033" offset="6112131">They said, "What is the objective?</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.205" offset="6116728">United wishes to accomplish with regard to adjust fuel rates here?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.631" offset="6134491">The answer is, United -- I'm reading at page 19 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.914" offset="6147553">United is found for over a long period time they had again better serve the public at large by setting large volumes of industrial gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.409" offset="6177541">This proceeding seeks a solution of the fundamental problem presented -- presently encountered in the sale of gas for industrial costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.090" offset="6208261">Such costumers are normally willing to install unnecessary facilities to burn gas and thereafter to purchase gas only when two conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.441" offset="6241698">First, that the cost of gas be no higher than competitive fuels and second, that the cost of gas be fixed by contract for a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.215" offset="6276807">Because the rates to distributors will be our subject to regulation in change, they have just upset our contracts before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.085" offset="6312333">The distributors are unable to safely put long-term rates for industrial gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.746" offset="6330932">This condition, a major obstacle to industrial sales could be effectively eliminated by permitting the Pipe Line Company to contract directly with the industrial costumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.861" offset="6371370">In other words, United has found another way of accomplishing the results that this Court did not allow Panhandle to accomplish by taking over the direct sales of the industrial business by showing that the middleman, the distributing company is incapable of making a binding contract because it can't make a binding contract for the purchase of fuel, and of course, a direct sale is not subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.070" offset="6480248">If we are reversed in this case, Mr. Fletcher can go to all the industrial costumers in this area citing this case and say, "You see, there's no use you're dealing to the local distributing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.539" offset="6522149">It can't make a binding contract."</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.761" offset="6531030">They make a -- we make a binding contract with them to sell them gas at a lower rate, we can change it the next day by filing a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.304" offset="6557153">It's been so held by the courts and of course, they scraped the cream of this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.343" offset="6573349">That's the only reason I can think of for this peculiar business, upsetting our contract by trying to increase it and then agreeing to serve that at even lower rate later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.845" offset="6611278">I think they're trying to establish that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.528" offset="6622041">Now, why is the proposition wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.851" offset="6635311">To understand the question as to what is wrong with the proceeding under 4 (d) and 4 (e), one must realize that in this business regulation, there may be several reasonable rates for the identical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.711" offset="6718798">I think that great many people have been misled in their thinking by the fact that most of the discussions of the reasonableness of a rate, particularly in this Court and other courts, has turned around rates fixed by the Commission after setting aside the rate fixed either by contract or by filing by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.760" offset="6810958">The Commission fixes a rate that produces only 5% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.049" offset="6824124">The company says that's confiscatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.692" offset="6838753">Or, a company fixes a rate producing the 7% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.094" offset="6856307">And the Commission says that's exorbitant and the Court sustains the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.202" offset="6872712">And somewhere in between there, there is an area of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.126" offset="6888490">And when the Commission is fixing the rate, it picks out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.210" offset="6900820">It pinpoints the spot there where it thinks the rate is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.029" offset="6920046">And the courts will not disturb the Commission if it is within that reasonable area to produce a fair return on its investment to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.725" offset="6958811">The State of California allows 6%, the Federal Power Commission, 5.5% on electric business, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.296" offset="6985143">But now, if you look at the Act, you'll remember that the Commission hasn't any power to fix rates until after it has set aside rates that have been originally fixed by a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.988" offset="7031850">The company existing rates are filed under 4 (c) or changes are filed under 4 (d) and the Commission may not draw out such a rate until a hearing under 4 (e) in which it has the same powers it has under 5 (a) to set it aside if it is unduly discriminatory or preferential or unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.541" offset="7126100">Now, what is the position of the Commission when it is passing upon a rate that has been fixed by a company either by filing or in a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.066" offset="7176255">It is in the same position in reviewing the Commission here as the Court is in reviewing the company's rate as the Court is in reviewing the Commission's rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.902" offset="7211572">It cannot set it aside unless it is unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or unduly preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.509" offset="7250024">Now a company isn't obligated to always put in a rate that gives it 5.5% if that be the agreed reasonable return or 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.756" offset="7290984">The company for its own purposes may of course, reduce its rates to meet competition provided, first, that the result doesn't create an undue preference or an undue discrimination, provided second, that it isn't, it doesn't so an undue burden on other consumers that this lower rate is absorbed by the company and provided of course, that it isn't so low as to prevent the company from performing its subject utility duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.972" offset="7419820">It isn't likely that the company would propose such a rate but a contract might become unreasonable for that reason by the action of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.231" offset="7452839">But otherwise, the Commission, as I read the Act, has no duty to set aside a rate because it's less than fully compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.673" offset="7502681">And Mr. Wahrenbrock has so admitted in his brief in the Sierra case, in the Sierra case which we've come to next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.803" offset="7531207">The Commission itself permitted the Pacific Gas and Electric Company to file and make effective rate to produce only 4.75% on its investment although it was conceded that 5.5% was a reasonable rate of return on its investment and Mr. Wahrenbrock said to the Commission, "That's perfectly profited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.074" offset="7612291">The rate is not discriminatory, it doesn't hurt anybody, the burden is absorbed by the stockholders of the company, it's not up to the Commission to double guess a company as to which of several rates, all of them reasonable, it may wish to select.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.321" offset="7673208">So there is no end, of course, this Court has often held in the railroad industry -- railroad -- carry the loss to meet the competition, trucks and water cottage were also here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.706" offset="7718766">In Tyler, Texas, they had competition from another well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.362" offset="7733394">In the particular situation we had in our case here, the question was, whether the Ideal Cement Company would buy gas at all or move elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.247" offset="7768921">And they were perfectly justified in agreeing to end into a contract at a special low rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.293" offset="7797133">Now having ended into a contract to sell at a special lower rate, which is less than fully compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.191" offset="7824718">They have an absolute right to do it and it's the Commission permitted them to do, and it permitted the contract filed, the question is, whether the company can come in and file under Section 4 (d) a new schedule of rates a little higher but still not exorbitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.749" offset="7894936">And thus break the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.477" offset="7905907">If they can file under 4 (d), that's exactly what they can do because in the hearing under 4 (d), the reasonableness of the contract rate isn't considered or reached at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.406" offset="7949584">Mr. Wahrenbrock conceded and they -- they've all conceded in their briefs the only issue in a proceeding under 4 (e) as to a rate proposed under 4 (d) is the reasonableness of the new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.482" offset="7993887">This court below pointed out, it can be that the new rate is reasonable and therefore, if it can be filed in violation of a contract, becomes the legal rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.175" offset="8040699">Even though the contract rate itself is perfectly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.737" offset="8058880">And it is for that reason, that we have insisted throughout thoughts on those statements, that a contract is valid in binding as between the parties until and unless it is set aside in a proceeding under 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.120" offset="8136411">Under 5 (a), Congress has given, has delegated to the Commission its power to abrogate contracts from the public interests suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.197" offset="8172774">They tell us that under 4 (d), Congress delegated the power to the Natural Gas Company, to abrogate its contract by merely filing a new rate, provided the new rate itself was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.399" offset="8233587">Now they based their arguments in part -- primarily on the wording of 4 (d), which I said before seems to me a very long stress language, page 101 again of Mr. Wahrenbrock's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.099" offset="8292310">Unless the Commission otherwise orders no change shall be made by any natural gas company in any rate or contract except after 30 days notice to the Commission and to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.002" offset="8339958">Mr. Wahrenbrock said yesterday "Look, it says no change shall be made by any natural gas company."</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.897" offset="8363572">That means that Congress said a natural gas company could unilaterally change its rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3664.923" offset="14659605">I want to first, before I get in to the matter, answer a question yesterday which Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked Mr. Wahrenbrock in which I did not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.202" offset="14696803">He asked him a question in 4 (d) whether the first phrase unless the Commission otherwise orders gave any additional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.501" offset="14729927">My understanding of that phrase is, that it modifies the except phrase at the end of the sentence and it gives power to the Commission to wave portions off, but not all of the 30 days required notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.406" offset="14793561">The last sentence of the section gives a distinct and a new power to the Commission where for good cost shown it can permit the rate to become effective without any notice whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.858" offset="14843402">Now, I want to answer too, if I may, as I had not had the time to do, the suggestion of Mr. Justice Black about the question of the equity and the question of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.348" offset="14889378">The -- United conceives that it is in performance of Section 4, 4 (d) permits a change in contracts is our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.922" offset="14943608">Contracts as used in Section 4 (d) is used in no different fashion from that in Section 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.125" offset="14976418">No rate ever becomes final whether approved under 4 (d) or 4 (e) rehearing or 5 (e) -- 5 (a) hearing because it is always subject to change by the Commission acting under the balance of either one of the sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.916" offset="15039634">Now, when this matter was filed, Mobile, as it should have done, filed a proceeding before the Alabama Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.946" offset="15075683">And in the same proceeding from which counsel quoted Mr. Pitman and I'll get to that in a moment, on cross-examination by the Commission, the President, Mr. Morris of Mobile said, that they left that application for an increase of the rate to Ideal (Inaudible) because their attorneys advised them that their earnings was so very excessive that the Alabama Commission would not entertain any application for an increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.809" offset="15187174">And in fact they said, they were ordered to make refunds for the year, I believe, it was 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.995" offset="15215909">Our position is and Chief Judge Hutcheson in the Tyler case held, that a natural gas company subject to the Act could not stop itself by contract from access to Section 4 because the Act is incorporated into and became a part of the contract itself and that it was subject to change in consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.821" offset="15307233">Now, the question, I believe, it was Mr. Justice Reed of whether, the contract could be considered in a full rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.439" offset="15341714">It has been consistently our contention that it can be, and this Court in the Midland case, which involved a Missouri statute that is precisely like or so precisely like that to add that the difference is on substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.867" offset="15399393">Mr. Chief Justice Taft there said that in a hearing on the section of the Missouri statute, its input note seven of the opinion, and I thought I had 5191, yes, 5191, which is like 4 (e) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.656" offset="15482567">Very, very substantially similar that there, the hearing was not only upon the proposed rate, but upon the contract and that the claimant of the contract there had the right to defend this contract and to adduced for the Commission's consideration what evidence he had in support of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.490" offset="15561874">I come in again, if I may, skipping but I want to answer the Court's questions as I understand which I conceived to be the more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.636" offset="15590504">I think my brief would take care of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.065" offset="15604193">Mr. Justice Frankfurter say's what is the gloss?</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.062" offset="15620180">It is sir, as I understand it, the Interstate Commerce Act, the courts hold that the Natural Gas Act comes from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.602" offset="15654348">Section 6 (3) three of the Interstate Commerce Act is similar to Section 4 (d), and if I may digress for the moment, that was the only section in existence at the time of Armour's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.944" offset="15711713">Now, I do not agree, that there is any difference in the Interstate Commerce Act and the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.957" offset="15735745">When one reads and considers the necessary connotations of Section 1 (a) in the light of Sections 4 (a) and (b), the purpose of Congress to take over the (Inaudible) gap and completely to regulate and preempt the regulation of that gap is as evident in those sections as it was evident against any other arrangement in the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
