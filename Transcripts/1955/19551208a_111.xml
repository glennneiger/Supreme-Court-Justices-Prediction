            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="11.075" offset="44199">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.820" offset="51200">Before embarking on the discussion of the matter which was being considered when the Court rolled this yesterday, I'd like, if I may, to touch upon two preliminary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.442" offset="101669">The first is it relates to a question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked as to why the trial judge in his oral statement felt that he was troubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.533" offset="138031">He said that he was troubled and he wished a review of one of these cases was sought in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.741" offset="162900">We agree with Mr. Wirin that the reason for the statement by the trial judge was that he was uncertain whether statements, admissions made in administrative hearings could be the basis for expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.066" offset="224235">We think that was the reason why Judge Harrison suggested that -- that review be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.339" offset="253283">The second matter that I failed to mention yesterday and I think it bears upon Judge Harrison's evaluation and -- and characterization of the personality and the type of person petitioner was is that the trial judge pointed out that he had had another simiar case involving a person whom he thought to be a different kind of young man, and in that case, he felt that expatriation had not been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.165" offset="360594">He differentiated this case from that case and I bring it forth to indicate that it shows a degree of selectivity and a special consideration given to this particular case by Judge Harrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.658" offset="410540">The rules of civil procedure on providing for a review and findings of fact provide that due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial judge to observe the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.517" offset="450038">And we believe that that is a factor which should be considered in this type of case as well as on others.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.683" offset="474697">In the (Inaudible) denaturalization case, this Court, in upholding the denaturalization of (Inaudible) mentioned the fact that it paid due regard to the opportunity of the trial judge to weigh the credibility and characteristics of the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.104" offset="576366">As I explained yesterday, we do not accept from the standard which was laid down in the Baumgartner and Schneiderman cases and which was accepted also in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.739" offset="622864">We accept the standard laid down in those cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>

            <text syncTime="168.933" offset="675631">I think a reading of the closing statement at the end of the case plus his consideration of the -- consideration of the matter of the admission of the immigration testimony before in the case that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.778" offset="731011">At the close of -- of his opinion, he says that he doesn't believe the -- the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.760" offset="759014">He believes that the petitioner was more accurate and more nearly truth in his testimony before the immigration authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.764" offset="787017">And at the bottom of the page 33, he says, “I don't know how you can ask counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.974" offset="803840">You can ask me to find for the plaintiff here in view of his admissions and statements before the immigration officer.”</text>
