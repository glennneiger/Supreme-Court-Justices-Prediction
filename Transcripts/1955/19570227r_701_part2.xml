            <text syncTime="110.705" offset="549219">And the position of the Government is that this Court has consistently held that where the trial is informed territory, the Congress has the power under the Constitution to provide for a legislative court and not an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.031" offset="622571">But because of the peculiar provisions in the Constitution about treason where it requires two witnesses in open court that that would require not a legislative court but an Article III court as a distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.047" offset="1230597">And the rest of it was addressed to trying to show that according to the history of common law, both for Britain and the United States, at the time the Constitution was adopted, it was conceived that under that power, the Congress would have the -- under that provision of the Constitution, that Congress would have the power to provide for trial of civilian dependents and civilian employees in the same manners it would members of the military corps themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.714" offset="1373330">There are number of orders that are part of the orders of the British in regard to these forces that they had in this country that are referred to in the Blumenthal book and we set them forth in footnotes of our brief, in page 28 to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.612" offset="1456922">And I will not take the time to read them all but they're dated in the 1775 and 1776, in that area of time, and they described time after time, various regulations of the commanders in regard to the women who are associated with these armed forces as well as the settlers and other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.903" offset="1546052">Now, I want to make it very clear that women at that time or when you -- the word camp follower was used was not conceived as merely hangers on in connection with the army because it often involved as described in some of this historical material, Martha Washington going to Valley Forge and some of the wives of the various British commanders were over here and wives of the troops and commanders and officers throughout, as well as of course, some of the other, but it did not have that connotation solely at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.278" offset="1719505">And there are number of cases described in our brief and also in the Blumenthal book in which we got much in the material in regard to various court-martial actions, the various dates both by the British and the Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.876" offset="1797977">And I'd like read just briefly from the communication by General Washington with regard to this matter that I think evidence is the reason for the court-martial jurisdiction and the necessity for the discipline that was involved in connection with it in the handling of the troops and trying to win the Revolutionary War.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.829" offset="1921797">“Dear Sir,” he is writing to the Superintendent of Finance of the Confederation, trying to tell him why he is spending so much money for all of these various purposes including taking care of the expenses for the various dependents that are along with the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.210" offset="1999329">As I never saw and never heard of the resolve of Congress spoken of the Secretary of War as mentioned in your letter of the 21st instance and conceive it a right inherent with command to limit as circumstances and the nature of service may require the proportion of women to the men of an army.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.127" offset="2078950">I confess I thought myself hurt by the interference of other departments without any previous notice or communication of sentiments with me on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.851" offset="2117820">It will appear by having recurrence to my orderly book that an economical attention to the public interest in this case has not been wanting but that upon every return of the number of women called for at different periods when compared with the totality of the army, it has been found that no general rule consisting with American or British customs could be established that would not increase the aggregate amount of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.945" offset="2222205">And therefore, that it was better to submit through the surplusage in some course than to render the expense greater and the even more extensive by adopting a limitation which would pervade the whole army.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.532" offset="2272569">Especially to as some of those corps were and still are under particular circumstances, for instance, the regiments of New York which in part are composed of Long Islanders and others who fled with their families when the enemy obtained possession of those places and -- and have no other means of subsistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.714" offset="2345294">The cries of these women, the sufferings of their children and the complaints of their husbands would admit of no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.033" offset="2374552">The latter with too much justice remarked, “If pay is withheld from us and provisions from our wives and children, we must all starve together or commit acts which may involve us in ruin.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.065" offset="2426692">Our wives add they could earn their rations but the soldier, navy officer for whom their wars has not to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.632" offset="2456994">In a word, I was obliged to give provisions to the extra women in these regiments or lose by desertion, perhaps to the enemy, some of the oldest and best soldiers in the service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="599.434" offset="2504223">And then, there are number of cases in which it tells about the difficulties and about the handling of the dependents, the wives and other -- and the settlers in considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.502" offset="2568485">Now, that as I see it, demonstrates the practical problem of the armed services today in trying to handle this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.495" offset="2608400">The dependents are not sent overseas with these various forces in 63 countries throughout the world today for their own placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.433" offset="2660227">It's because of the need, both in the morale and assistance and aid to the men in the services that they are included in the manner that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.171" offset="2711113">And it's a different situation, of course these constitutional concepts have to be adjusted to changing times but certainly the same basic reasons that are denoted in the letter of Judge -- George Washington are involved in the problem today of having these people with the armed services in foreign areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.509" offset="2964501">And this is peace time in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.366" offset="2983936">And also, we must have a ready defense in these 63 areas of the world to have -- to meet any force at any moment, and that's why we've gotten there.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.063" offset="3042659">And I'm sure this Court recognizes that the combined judgment of the Congress and the executive that is necessary and that's why it's being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.825" offset="3089784">And it's a part of that, of the expense and difficulties that relate to having the dependents of the family there are born by this country because of the need as I conceive it, rather than because of any desire or merely pleasure of these people concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="2358.400" offset="9540044">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.527" offset="9552583">I come here for the second time to urge that nothing in the Constitution of the United States authorizes the trial of a civilian woman by court-martial in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.407" offset="9608067">But before I address myself to the Constitution, I wish first to show that no such power can be derived outside the Constitution that the fact that a foreign country may consent to our taking the offender home, or even trying the offender on foreign soil, does not in and of itself confer any jurisdiction on our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.553" offset="9700645">And there are two illustrations of that in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.195" offset="9711198">One is the Wiltberger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.354" offset="9719871">Wiltberger killed a sailor on board an American ship anchored off the shore of some Chinese river before the days of extraterritoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.567" offset="9760726">He was brought home for trial and this Court held in the 5 of Wheaton that since no act of Congress reached his offense, he went free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.133" offset="9798969">And the second illustration is Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.730" offset="9809314">Toth was taken to Korea for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.473" offset="9820285">Korea made no demand for his surrender although he had killed a Korean national.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.603" offset="9840870">Toth was going to be tried by an American court-martial and this Court held that no such jurisdiction could be conferred on that tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.858" offset="9877859">And the second point is that the jurisdiction asserted in Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code was always based on our law as the legislative history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.091" offset="9926760">The subject 2 clause was intended only to avoid conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.201" offset="9943270">It was intended as a limitation to avoid international complications, not as a conditional grant and the best proof of that is the other woman, the British woman, Mrs. Billhardt (ph) who was tried by an American court-martial in a Eritrea, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.027" offset="10010561">Certainly, no treaty there, no agreement, she was sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.923" offset="10034176">In order to get her into (Inaudible), she had to be paroled by the Attorney General and she is now serving a life sentence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.614" offset="10068867">And the third point is that the NATO Treaties didn't purport to enlarge our military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.482" offset="10104393">I agree with the Government, we should regard these cases in the light of the NATO or NATO-like agreements instead of these temporary agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.969" offset="10138352">It's perfectly clear from Article VII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement that we were given the right to exercise such military jurisdiction as we have by our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.176" offset="10187149">It didn't purport to enlarge our jurisdiction and it couldn't have done so because if these people were not triable by military law as a -- as a matter of the limitations of our Constitution, no treaty could remove those Constitution -- those limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.490" offset="10280354">And in that connection, I'd like to read only two sentences from the brief the Government filed two terms ago in the Katz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.158" offset="10315045">The basic axiom is that as a sovereign state, the United State possesses in its dealing with other states, all of the normal powers of a fully independent nation, subject to constitutional limitations like the Bill of Rights which governed all exercise of governmental authority in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.311" offset="10407727">And again, together with statutes and treaties, executive agreements are subject to the Bill of Rights and the other clauses of the Constitution which protect all Americans from the excesses of official authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.953" offset="10466241">Now, I submit that that is a doctrine too fundamental to be put on or taken off like a dress shirt as occasion may require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.787" offset="10497588">The Bill of Rights is a limitation on all federal power where -- wherever it's exerted and even if you leave the word treaty power and talk about the power to conduct foreign relations, that power can only be exercised within the limitations of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.243" offset="10563417">And insofar as the military needs of the international community to which resort is made are relevant, those needs can be satisfied by us, only subject to our own constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.537" offset="10624543">So, I come back to the Constitution, which is the source of all power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.371" offset="10647949">We must bottom this asserted power to try by court-martial civilian women and civilian children on some grant of power in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.874" offset="10693925">Now, before I get to what may be regarded as doctrine of considerations, I'd like to explore briefly some of the so-called practical considerations which appear in the Government's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.613" offset="10744916">Some of them are just lawyers' talk in briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.801" offset="10757663">Some of them are letters from overseas commanders, plainly and literally self-serving letters from the very officers whose powers are here called in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.911" offset="10810117">This Court has never in going outside of the record to find materials of a -- facts of general knowledge has never looked to self-serving documents of this nature and more importantly, those materials are wholly unsatisfactory in several important respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.949" offset="10906248">Let's take first dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.462" offset="10920249">The Government argued, “Well, we've got to try these poor girls by court-martial otherwise, they will be thrust into some foreign court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.233" offset="10959329">And we pointed out that under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, all offenses by civilian dependents, not just offenses outside the camp, all offenses by civilian dependents are given to the foreign country as having primary jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="2735.727" offset="11049399">And not without regard whether on United States enclave or not?</text>

          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="2739.915" stopTime="2757.582">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="2739.915" offset="11066117">Exactly, and without regard to the victim of their offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.268" offset="11083567">Any of a primary jurisdiction over all offenses by civilian dependents is conceded to the receiving state by the NATO treaty and the Government replies to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.986" offset="11126408">Well, it's the best deal we could get.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="2757.582" offset="11136752">But what that means is that if England in response to its public opinion, things that murders committed by American civilians living at the Hotel Savoy should be tried at the Old Bailey, they may stand on that?</text>

          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="2773.130" stopTime="3184.702">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="2773.130" offset="11198924">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.653" offset="11205089">Now then, we said there are very few cases of court-martial trials of civilian dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.990" offset="11242392">Out of almost 10,000 cases in the Court of Military Appeals, there have only been four and two of them are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.993" offset="11282411">We still don't know, we still don't know how many civilian dependents have been tried by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.498" offset="11300488">The Government says, "Well, there are about 500 offenses and we got waivers out of 420."</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.786" offset="11325565">But they don't say how many were actually tried by American court-martial and I will be very much interested in seeing the memorandum which the Chief Justice has requested because I don't think there will be many.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.365" offset="11375929">So, is it the -- is it the urge to punish crime that is the motivating factor here or is it the urge to control and discipline the women?</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.460" offset="11416263">I suggest that it is the latter because the first has been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.920" offset="11434130">Now, we get to the civilian employees and we said, “Yes, we -- there are 23,000 American civilian employees overseas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.907" offset="11478120">What military reason is there why you need civilians to do military work?</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.026" offset="11502571">And we said pointing to the budget for the appropriations hearing in the committee reports in similar legislative material, the only reason they've got civilians doing military work overseas is budgetary, it costs a little less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.072" offset="11566728">Now, whether these modern budgets give us more bang for the buck is of course not a justiciable issue, but whether they give us less constitutional protection for a buck is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.368" offset="11623884">We said there's no breakdown of these 23,000 civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.887" offset="11646036">How many of them are clerks and shoppers?</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.270" offset="11659515">Our understanding is most of more in the lower brackets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.172" offset="11671113">Well, we still get no breakdown although it's finally conceded that some 40% are in class five or lower, but we do get some figures on people who aren't even civilian employees of the United States who are just employees of contractors and technical representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.009" offset="11742480">And as the Government argues, the only alternative trial by court-martial is no trial at all for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.128" offset="11778947">Many of these offenses are not offenses against foreign law and many others are not offenses against the general criminal law and we say, “Well, what about the alien employees of the Department of Defense overseas?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.438" offset="11840178">There are 15 times as many alien civilian employees as American civilian employees and the Government says, “Oh well, we don't let them near the classified papers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.063" offset="11882705">And then, we ask, “What about the civilians at military installations in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.072" offset="11906738">Every one of which from the Pentagon down is infested by civilian who works cheek by jaw, side by side with the persons in uniform.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.727" offset="11945399">“Oh,” says the Government, “we have a U.S. Commissioner and he tries traffic offenses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.897" offset="11970058">Well, now, that's a pretty agile broken field running, but this is an appellate court, not the Rose Bowl.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.612" offset="12004854">And I submit that these materials are utterly unreliable as a basis performing a -- a judicial judgment on what is necessary or what is reasonable, but more importantly, this is not a question of reasonableness or of legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.020" offset="12074548">It is a matter that has been placed beyond the scope of legislative judgment by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.293" offset="12099626">And I will illustrate by the cases Mr. Solicitor has referred to, the state cases that say, you don't have to have indictment or jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.718" offset="12137347">Well, now, it's perfectly reasonable to say in California that “We will prosecute by information instead of indictment” or to say in Utah, “We will only put eight men on a criminal jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.975" offset="12186352">That is perfectly reasonable and therefore, it does not contravene the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.326" offset="12207773">But you certainly couldn't justify similar procedures in a federal court on the ground that it is reasonable and reasonable Congressmen might conclude that this is a better way to do it, because federal action is governed by the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.632" offset="12264929">Now, what we're dealing with here is the extended jury trial and even more importantly, a boundary between civil and military jurisdiction and to ascertain that, you use other techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.228" offset="12315397">You resort to history, to the precedents, to the practice, best illustration, best reasoned illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.277" offset="12347580">In the Crawford case, this Court held in the 212 U.S. that you couldn't use government employees on a criminal jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.638" offset="12372971">In the Wood case in the 299, that was overruled, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.517" offset="12388540">Because the Government showed by resort to historical materials from the days of Black-Leather-Folios and law of French that a king-servant wasn't per se ineligible to be a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.534" offset="12432530">That is the technique that you used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.685" offset="12441203">Now, everything, history, precedents and practice and I will go into the history in -- at some length because of the materials that have been adduced here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.303" offset="12479655">All three unite against this military jurisdiction over civilian wives in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.236" offset="12515391">And first -- first, I looked at Clause 14 of Article 8 -- Article I Section 8, “The power to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.107" offset="12578920">I will call that by way of short-hand through out the Clause 14 power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.483" offset="12600341">Well, the first blush impression is that the power to govern the armed forces is not a power to govern wives of the armed forces, because they're not a part of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.669" offset="12641092">They're not members of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.855" offset="12661885">True, when they marry a service man, marriage is a contract that creates a status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.677" offset="12685187">Enlistment is a contract that creates a status, but when the chaplain marries the girl, he isn't acting as recruiting sergeant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.489" offset="12720400">And what about the children, why do the children become subject to military law just because papa wears a soldier suit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.672" offset="12749134">Now, that first blush impression that the land and naval forces doesn't include the wives and children of the land and naval forces is confirmed by detailed study and such study leads to the conclusion that military jurisdiction is a matter of status, except for a very limited class of civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.113" offset="12838891">Now, historically --</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.181" offset="12927185">I'm dealing only with wives here but -- at the beginning, when this -- when I commenced this litigation, I felt that possibly you could make a distinction based on functional connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.281" offset="12983609">But the deeper I went into it, the deeper -- the more convinced I was if the line is drawn on status and therefore functional connection -- therefore, although a military jurisdiction asserted over a person is not functionally connected was broader than over at persons who were so connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.269" offset="13071485">There wasn't any justification for the other either in time of peace, because traditionally, the only civilian subject to court-martial jurisdiction were under three very distinct limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.782" offset="13133552">The first was functional connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.807" offset="13141703">The second was it had to be in time of war or actual hostility and the third had -- was that it had to be in the field that is to say in the theater of war or actual hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.554" offset="13184648">As I point out later, the extension from person serving with which implied functional connection and from retainers to the camp which implied some degree at least of functional connection to persons merely accompanying, so that the mother-in-law would be subject to the miliary jurisdiction if she stayed long enough as the curious legislative history of the code indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.099" offset="13282868">There was an extension, but -- but I think that when you go into it, it -- that jurisdiction over evens functionally connected persons can't be properly or constitutionally exercised in time of peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="3727.172" offset="15015100">If I had researched for a little further, I could and should have pointed out that not only didn't in this provision that they rely on it in their brief, passed the Continental Congress 12 days later when the 1786 Articles of War were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.870" offset="15085944">It repealed the similar provision that had been in the 1776 articles.</text>

            <text syncTime="3863.420" offset="15560119">There's reference to the fact that the Coast Guard which used to be known of course as the Revenue Cutter Service had civilian seamen on board public vessels and the implication of course is that these civilian seamen, notwithstanding their civilian status were subject to trial by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.029" offset="15638591">That is a mistaken implication because the Revenue Cutter Services never had court-martial jurisdiction of any kind until 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.206" offset="15679237">Then, there is -- there are dug out of the archives some trials of settlers in the 1920s and 1930s, not in the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="3912.415" offset="15756142">Well now, there were three instances at the time when the army didn't have a lawyer and when the question came up after the settler had become the post trader.</text>

            <text syncTime="3934.339" offset="15843809">No, Your Honor, that is (Inaudible) Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.891" offset="15858019">It's at pages 46 to 47 of the white brief, it's set forth in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.613" offset="15888948">Then, the Government very conveniently sets forth, I'm awfully glad they did in Appendix B of their reply brief on re-argument beginning at page 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.096" offset="15934819">Two opinions of the Judge Advocate General in full, which we only had in digested form and as their text is reflected in Winthrop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.772" offset="15977556">And they make it perfectly clear that the civilian settler retainers to the camp jurisdiction of the American Articles of War that was there beginning in 1775 was limited to a time of war or actual hostilities and was limited to a situation in the field when the troops were engaged in defensive our offensive operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.900" offset="16082045">The argument seems to be, the argument seems to be that because that opinion refers to a few trials which took place earlier and condemns those trials, therefore, the condemned practice is to be taken as more correctly establishing the law than the opinion which condemned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.142" offset="16175041">That goes under the name of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.277" offset="16191551">Well, now, that being sought when the constitutional convention adopted Clause 14, verbatim from the Articles of Confederation, can it be supposed that anybody read in those words land and naval forces an expansible jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.734" offset="16289353">When Your Honors recall that even the provision for a standing army under the army clause of the Constitution was denounced as unconstitutional in the first Congress, is it reasonable to suppose that if anyone had ever imagined that clause to be an expansible concept, capable of including within a sweep women and children that some of the valuable articulate and imaginative anti-federalists wouldn't have screamed to high heaven, all through the ratifying conventions just impossible?</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.274" offset="16431564">There, it is correct to say that with only scattered exceptions, there were no actual civilian trials by court-martial in time of peace with approval of higher authority before 1941 that there was no trial of a wife by court-martial until 1950 and that even those first trials with military government trials because they took place in occupied territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.923" offset="16546085">Now, the conclusion that the Clause 14 power doesn't reach these two women follows from anyone of three independent bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.046" offset="16578581">And the first is a contemporaneous long, continued construction of the constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.796" offset="16609614">The second is that we look for our boundaries of jury trial, the situation as it existed in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.845" offset="16637827">And third, whenever that boundary was sought to be extended, in the Milligan case, in Duncan against Kahanamoku and in the Toth case, the attempt has failed, and I'm happy to see that it hasn't succeeded here again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.536" offset="16692579">Now, is that Clause 14 power, it's varied by anything in the Necessary and Proper Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.332" offset="16727792">In the Toth case, it was squarely held in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.678" offset="16745138">Toth case, the Court said, “That power is not enlarged by Necessary and Proper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.410" offset="16772096">We show that no one ever thought so in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.478" offset="16788396">We show that no one ever thought so after McCulloch against Maryland that demonstrated the potentialities of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.413" offset="16816086">We show that no military man who certainly wouldn't be backward about asserting military jurisdiction ever thought so for a century afterwards and here is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.573" offset="16868749">The Necessary and Proper Clause after all is the doctrine of implied powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.524" offset="16892573">But the Necessary and Proper Clause doesn't dilute specific personal guarantees because after all the Bill of Rights amends Clause 18 of Section 8 of Article I just as much as it amends everything else in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.601" offset="16952863">And if we go back -- if we go back to what the great Chief Justice said in McCulloch against Maryland and I'll just read a single sentence which has really foreshadowed the entire development of the Necessary and Proper Clause that the end be legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.269" offset="17027469">Let it be within the scope of the Constitution and all means which are appropriate which are plainly adopted to that end which are not prohibited but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.132" offset="17078983">Now, our position is that to try by court-martials, civilian women in time of peace who weren't so triable at the time of the adoption of the Constitution is not a legitimate and is not within the scope of the Constitution, is twice prohibited by the Constitution and is utterly inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, and that brings us back to the Toth conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.551" offset="17188697">And as I have said in response to questions put by Mr. Justice Douglas, nobody, -- nobody ever raised the constitutional question when this jurisdiction over civilians was first extended and that was in 1916 as to all free limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.939" offset="17262153">From functional connection, they went to accompanying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.435" offset="17272184">From war, they went to peace and from theater of operations they went to outside the continental limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.918" offset="17306143">In the briefs, there is considerable discussion as to whether the wives and children outside the United States are part of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.338" offset="17355776">I think it's an attempt to semanticize the men to a military status and certainly so far as the civilian dependents are concerned, that attempt necessarily breaks down in the face of the NATO provisions which put them in a separate category and don't give them as much -- don't subject them to as much American jurisdiction as civilian employees or members of the forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.732" offset="17465386">And I was prepared to argue as I've argued in the briefs that they are no more members of the land and naval forces than the women who are quartered with their husbands on any army post or air force base or naval station in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.122" offset="17526930">And then, I must confess, I was -- I was amazed when the Solicitor General said that it's only a question of legislative judgment that anytime Congress wants to subject the good ladies in Fort Myer to trial by court-martial, they can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.649" offset="17601014">I suggest to my learned friend that he examine the Sixth Amendment and read it over just once.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.918" offset="18586143">And I -- and I was about to add that of course they have no written Constitution in both the Toth and Hirschberg cases that would have arisen differently if they had come up under English law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.532" offset="18632537">The ground for sustaining the consular trial given in Ross was that the Constitution can have no operation in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.578" offset="18668795">We know that that's a stand up because that this Court later said, “The Constitution of the United States is in enforced whenever and wherever the power of our Government is exercised,” so that does in Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.814" offset="18725742">And then there was a query, I think in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion last June, “Can't it be said that the consular court that tried Ross was exercising Japanese judicial power?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.096" offset="18774852">And if you look at the consular court proceedings, that does in Ross either because he was an American officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.323" offset="18799720">He derived his power from an American statute and then in his warrants and on the entire proceedings, they recited a reliance on Acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.465" offset="18844338">The only basis I think -- the only basis on which it is possible to sustain the consular jurisdiction is that it is free Constitution that it goes back to the Treaty with Morocco at 1786 which was ratified to the continental Congress while the constitutional convention was in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.529" offset="18920511">So that in other words, the person tried by a consul can't claim a jury because it was pre-constitutional, but that's the very reason why these women can't be tried by court-martial because these women in their status in time of peace were not triable by a court-martial in time of peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="4762.669" offset="19157076">Now, I address myself to the question of legislative courts, and that I would like to cover at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.088" offset="19186751">First of all, I think that until last June, nobody ever considered a court-martial to be a legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.376" offset="19219978">That was regarded as an executive agency and it was so regarded for two functional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.189" offset="19247250">In the first place, the court-martial is created by the order of an executive officer, generally a military officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.837" offset="19277761">And in the second place, the court-martial requires the approval of the appointing officer to give validity to each judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.497" offset="19308481">That is still so under the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.567" offset="19316736">There is nothing on which the appellate processes can operate until the convening authority has acted on the judgment and dismissal -- death in general officer cases, there must also be action, further action by the Secretary or the President to give validity to the judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.713" offset="19389252">So, they're not legislative courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.415" offset="19400119">By their very nature, they're executive courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.542" offset="19412658">But assuming for purposes of argument that courts-martial are legislative courts does not help solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.718" offset="19445363">We think not, because at the basis of legislative courts, as Your Honors said in Bakelite is that other articles invest Congress with powers in the exertion of which it may create inferior courts and clothe them with functions deemed essential or helpful in carrying those powers into execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.405" offset="19536060">So that if a court-martial is a legislative court, it must be a court created under the Clause 14 power which brings us right back to where we started.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.903" offset="19578065">Moreover, and this is a point on which I fear the Government's arguments have always been confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.390" offset="19603978">The question of legislative versus constitutional court doesn't solve the question of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.410" offset="19632086">Take Alaska, a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.220" offset="19643371">The Alaskan courts are legislative courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.791" offset="19653611">The judges don't have life tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.025" offset="19662493">Their salaries can be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.693" offset="19669180">They can be removed by the President for cause but the defendant, the criminal defendant in Alaska is entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.708" offset="19705229">And I see no reason incidentally why a man can't be tried for treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.855" offset="19721843">And the U.S. Court for Alaska or the U.S. Court in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Court of the territory of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.674" offset="19749115">Article III has to do with the judges' tenure and his salary and his removability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.502" offset="19772416">It doesn't have anything to do with a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.530" offset="19788612">Furthermore, in the three insular cases relied on by the Court last June, Mankichi, Dorr and Balzac, those were not courts created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.243" offset="19831453">Those were insular courts that had long existed whose existence was recognized by Congress, and the decision went on the grounds, simply on the ground, we will not inflict on these offshore possessions with a long non-common law jury heritage, something that has its roots deep in the institutions and the processes of common law country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.373" offset="19923926">And I don't think and I have read and reread those cases many times since June.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.195" offset="19947227">I don't think there's anything in them to support the proposition that all of the Bill of Rights stops at the water's edge.</text>

            <text syncTime="4993.515" offset="20080556">Yes, but the Organic Act provisions were construed as though they were constructional provisions and there is certainly language in the cases which suggest that those are privileges that couldn't have been taken away even if they hadn't been specifically set forth in the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.216" offset="20147325">Now, take the matter of bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.364" offset="20159864">How can you justify depriving civilians of bail?</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.654" offset="20177105">If you subject them to military law, you deprive them of bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.222" offset="20191316">There's no such thing as bail in military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.805" offset="20205631">Even the -- the offshore territories always had bail, even the consular courts had a system of bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.092" offset="20234783">And I would say that the absence of bail in the military system really emphasizes the other inappropriateness of trying civilians by military courts, and I ask the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.887" offset="20294029">What is there in the Constitution that justifies withdrawing that guarantee from these women simply because they're married to servicemen and they're living with them overseas?</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.663" offset="20341049">Where is the source of power?</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.908" offset="20358081">Let's talk about legislative choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.265" offset="20367485">Well, as the colloquy between Senators Kemp and Keith Hoffer which I've read shows, Congress made no choice, no conscious choice, it was simply continuing in essence a military jurisdiction that was always on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.834" offset="20429761">But in any event, I will say, it is not a legitimate legislative choice to subject to trial by court-martial persons who don't fall within Clause 14, for two reasons, both of which I will develop in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.376" offset="20491933">The first is that courts-martial are necessarily regulated by the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.593" offset="20516801">Now, the President can legislate for those whom he commands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.678" offset="20533206">He is the Commander-in-Chief and every order has a -- implies a legislative content.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.574" offset="20560792">And I'm not troubled by his ordering the armed forces about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.059" offset="20582630">He is their Commander-in-Chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.662" offset="20589108">It's his business to give orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.920" offset="20594124">That's what a commander is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.300" offset="20603632">But he's not the Commander-in-Chief of the civilian wives and as I will demonstrate in more detail, unless -- unless you give the President to these broad uncanalized legislative powers, you don't really have a system of military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.792" offset="20661624">And the second which I will also develop at greater length is that military trial of civilians is inconsistent with our institutions and foreign to our traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.356" offset="20707913">And no other power, no other power authorizes this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.998" offset="20726408">This was time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.222" offset="20731319">It wasn't an occupied territory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.597" offset="20740827">It wasn't the Madsen v. Kinsella situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.754" offset="20753471">The Madsen v. Kinsella wasn't cited last June in the opinion because it was plainly irrelevant, a very different proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.051" offset="20786698">And the War Power, we submit would be unavailing here twice, twice before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.225" offset="20815329">The War Power has been relied upon to extend military jurisdiction over civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.753" offset="20837480">Twice the attempt has met with defeat, Ex parte Milligan, Duncan against Kahanamoku.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.475" offset="20860364">Now, there's some talk in the briefs about the combination of powers, combination of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.369" offset="20883874">Well, yes, if you're writing a brief or writing an opinion, there are many situations in which you can say, “Well, this can be supported on this clause and that clause and the other clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.419" offset="20928073">It's very easy to write that and it makes sense that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.598" offset="20944792">But here, we're dealing with two powers which are severely insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.261" offset="20963495">The Clause 14 power is insufficient because these women aren't part of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.523" offset="20984498">The treaty power, the power to conduct foreign relations is insufficient because you can't make a valid treaty that will conflict with the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.092" offset="21018770">How then do you get a sufficiency out of those two individual insufficient powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.212" offset="21039250">We say that even in constitutional law, the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts?</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.644" offset="21065059">Now, as a matter of fact, unless you can put these trials under Clause 14, it is impossible to support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.810" offset="21109676">One reason is perhaps it'll complicate it for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.966" offset="21126290">Absent Clause 14, what has made these acts crimes?</text>

            <text syncTime="5276.454" offset="21212285">Well, Article 118, Uniform Code, which reads, “Any person subject to this Code.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5555.822" offset="22329699">So that the more -- and this is by way of conclusion, the more this problem is (Inaudible), the more you must reach the conclusion that these trials cannot be supported, except as an exercise of the Clause 14 power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.657" offset="22397095">In other words, the deeper you go into, the longer you study, the more you are bound to arrive at the conclusion that the only way, if there is a way to support these trials is on the basis on which the prosecutions were instituted and the basis on which these cases were defended at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.483" offset="22480374">Now, it is always necessary to bear in mind that military law, even with the ameliorations in McCulloch still involves a substantial curtailment of protections available to civilians generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.614" offset="22540873">Fifth and -- Fourth and Fifth Amendments are substantially diluted at military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.914" offset="22566055">There is no right to confrontation at military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.286" offset="22583609">In answer to the Chief Justice's question, why can Mrs. Covert now be retried here?</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.578" offset="22612762">The reason is the prior testimony can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.686" offset="22625196">This is a trial by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.742" offset="22633451">The prior testimony of the English witnesses can be used without producing those witnesses here or sending her back to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.189" offset="22667201">And that as I have said, there is no bail at military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.507" offset="22688517">Now, there were some references by the Solicitor General to the NATO reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.560" offset="22716729">The second Senate reservation to the basic NATO decree is where a person subject to the military jurisdiction of the United States is to be tried by the authorities of a receiving state, under the treaty, the commanding officer of the Armed Forces of the U.S. in such state shall examine the laws of such state with particular reference to the procedural safeguards contained in the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="5726.251" offset="23011495">But even more important, it is not yet clear, it is not yet clear that the person who is subject to military law has any constitutional protections at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.419" offset="23056112">And it's very unclear whether the person subject to military law can obtain the same kind of collateral review of his constitutional contentions that are available to a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.614" offset="23108880">Now, we know at the scope of collateral review for -- alleged constitutional deprivation is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.205" offset="23135316">Johnson v. Zerbst, Leyra v. Denno, but when I have the (Inaudible) case here, this term Number 533 trying to equate collateral review in a Court of Claims, military case with the civilian cases, certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.282" offset="23199577">And of course, I'm comforted by the thought that certiorari denied means nothing except to the losing litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.609" offset="23224863">But the point is that we still don't know whether if these women are subject to military law and they claimed an infringement of their constitutional rights, they have any right of the same kind of collateral review that they would have if they've been tried in a state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.847" offset="23301872">Now, I am not troubled by the fact that we deny many freedoms to those in uniform because after all, the whole purpose, the whole purpose of a military code is to be a deterrent disciplinary force that will send thousands of people obediently to their death if need be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.387" offset="23387972">But what is there in the Constitution that empowers the withholding of those freedoms and of those protections from civilian women and civilian children?</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.940" offset="23434156">The Government has never yet faced up to the question of what you do with the teenage child who killed someone.</text>

            <text syncTime="5850.531" offset="23508553">Of course, it isn't covered in the code of the manual, those aren't adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.929" offset="23522137">Those aren't provisions adopted to trial of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.499" offset="23536452">But to return to the basic question, what is there in the Constitution that permits all these protections to be withdrawn from these women simply because they're overseas with their husbands and rationed by the armed forces?</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.380" offset="23599982">That question, if the Court please, has not yet been answered from any source.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.967" offset="23622343">The fact of the matter is that military file of civilians is utterly foreign to our condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.772" offset="23649510">And if we go back to the petition of right in 1628, rather than Mr. Blumenthal's letter in the back of the Government's brief and I want to say, I cannot accept that hearsay letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5977.847" offset="24017836">Yes, there were trials by military commission in the civil war until the Milligan case came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.206" offset="24043227">The Lincoln conspirators were tried by military commission here in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.348" offset="24063812">I think in retrospect that was probably is greater block on our history of the assassination itself and it's -- thereafter that you get in the pages of Winthrop in the jag opinions that are set forth in Appendix B, the latest Government brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.486" offset="24132357">You get the spirit of legality, the -- the military in strict placing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.154" offset="24163077">Self disciplining itself in strict subordination to the civil power and to the clauses of the Constitution, and when the martial law case came up in Duncan against Kahanamoku, martial law in Hawaii, there was a tenable narrow ground sent forth in Chief Justice Stone's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.962" offset="24238310">He said, “I don't think there was enough necessity here to warrant it,” but the majority of the Court put it on the broader ground that this is inconsistent with our tradition because there is a change in the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.171" offset="24283136">And if you want a laboratory test of whether it is desirable to shift that boundary, then I recommend a reading of these rather short records in this case and you'll see how these women were dealt with and ask yourselves as you read the short record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.702" offset="24357219">This isn't the big record of trial by court-martial, this are just the appellate opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.617" offset="24380938">I'd like Your Honors to ask yourselves as you read those opinions, whether in any American civil court, federal, or state, or territorial, these women would have been treated this way with the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.573" offset="24440707">I say that to sustain these trials does violence to the tradition of the founders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.946" offset="24470277">It does violence to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.220" offset="24479368">It does violence to the heritage of all its expositors up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.534" offset="24500579">But perhaps more immediately, pertinent is the circumstance to -- that to sustain these trials is utterly inconsistent with Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.773" offset="24545510">Now, Toth was not in the United States when the writ was sought on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.489" offset="24568393">He was in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.814" offset="24573722">He was on foreign soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.694" offset="24593262">Congress plainly intended to reach his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.209" offset="24611234">Toth plainly had violated Article 118, UCMJ, because he was the person subject to this Code when he killed that poor Korean.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.178" offset="24647178">He was accompanying the forces overseas and their jurisdiction wasn't lessened by the fact that he'd been brought there forcibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.348" offset="24675809">Now, the rationale of last June's opinion, that Congress can punish crimes committed abroad can put the accused on trial before American courts-martial that it doesn't have to extend them to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.817" offset="24725755">That rationale was certainly is fully applicable to Toth as it was to these women.</text>

            <text syncTime="6220.826" offset="24989800">What I'm saying is that the Toth reason that -- that the reasoning last June in these cases would have reached Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.240" offset="25027417">And I think it would have reached him even if the Red Hat had been sought when he was still in the United States, when he was fighting extradition because under the rationale of last June, he would have been fighting extradition to a legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.898" offset="25090006">There's never been any problem about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.690" offset="25097216">We've had extradition to legislative courts since the 1790.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.619" offset="25116965">And there's no problem about extraditing him to a Military Government Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.706" offset="25133265">That's nearly the ankle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.115" offset="25138907">That's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.734" offset="25145386">And so, I say again, it was the reasoning of the Court's opinion last June was ample to withhold Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.997" offset="25194392">I would like now to refer briefly to a point that was not argued last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.510" offset="25224485">I very much hope Your Honors will never have reason to come to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.343" offset="25239845">But on the assumption that the jurisdiction has upheld, I put the proposition that it was lost in the Covert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.294" offset="25275580">She is to be retried in the District of Columbia, unless the opinion is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.463" offset="25300344">He is to be retried in the District of Columbia at Bolling Field Air Force Base, literally within the shadow of the capitol dome.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.411" offset="25344125">Now, I don't question in any degree that this rehearing is the continuation of the original proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.916" offset="25366068">I've never questioned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.111" offset="25370875">I couldn't question it of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.436" offset="25384145">But how, I ask, how can you support the military trial of a civilian in the District of Columbia?</text>
            <text syncTime="6338.566" offset="25460736">Last June, the Court said, “We hold only that military jurisdiction, once validly attached continues until final disposition of the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.082" offset="25514757">Now, where there has been an expiration of a term of enlistment or the termination of a commission by operation of law with no affirmative act by the Government in either instance, then it's perfectly clear that military jurisdiction does contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.172" offset="25587169">But ever since 1862, the military rulings have been consistent on this one point, that whenever military status is destroyed by affirmative act of the Government at any stage of the proceedings, at any stage of the proceedings, military jurisdiction is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.664" offset="25661147">Now, the only assumption on which Mrs. Covert could have been subject to military jurisdiction was while she was accompanying the forces overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.885" offset="25702003">Now, that is a military jurisdiction, geographically limited in space just as the traditional military jurisdiction over civilians from the Continental Congress down to 1960 was limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.419" offset="25772116">Now, when the Government removed her back to within the continental limits of the United States, that jurisdiction was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.162" offset="25803045">And once her conviction was set aside as it was, she wasn't subject to trial by court-martial anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.920" offset="25834078">And the same result follows when you compare the custody provisions of the Uniform Code with the provisions of the former Articles of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.808" offset="25877650">Under Article of War 2 (e) of 1916 on, I'll get a very short provision so I'll quote them accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.272" offset="25923521">Under the Articles of War, all persons under sentence of judge by courts-martial were subject to military law and it didn't make any difference where the place of confinement was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.975" offset="25966362">The question was what court?</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.570" offset="25976707">What kind of tribunal imposed the sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.624" offset="25984961">And if it -- they were serving a sentence by court-martial, they were subject to military law no matter where that was being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.801" offset="26013696">But in the Uniform Code, Article 2 (7), it makes the Code applicable only to all persons in custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6491.863" offset="26073882">And when they are no longer under the custody of the armed forces, then Article 58 (a) of the Uniform Code says, “Persons confined in a penal or correctional institution not under the control of one of the armed forces shall be subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed by the Courts of the United States and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.181" offset="26171162">So that when Mrs. Covert was placed in civilian custody, when she was first in the custody of the Department of Justice in Alderson, there in the custody of the D.C. Government of the District Jail and then on the custody of Department of Health, Education and so forth when she was at Saint Elizabeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.238" offset="26243365">When she was placed in civilian custody by the very terms of the express and explicit terms of the Uniform Code, she was no longer subject to military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.554" offset="26284638">And having been placed there, the jurisdiction terminated and when the conviction was set aside, she couldn't be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.462" offset="26312328">Now, there's a talk in the briefs about well -- the Air Force indicated an intent to retain jurisdiction over her by confining her.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.280" offset="26351616">Well, I don't think it's particularly helpful to attempt to attribute intent to collective organization, but if anyone thinks that it's -- in any degree helpful to talk in those terms, then I would respond that one intends the natural and probable consequences of -- of one's act and that when you put a military prisoner in a civilian institution that are no longer military prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.055" offset="26454643">Now, of course, this kind of consequence wouldn't follow if you put a soldier in one of Mr. J.V. Bennett's lodging places, because he would stil have a military status even if his enlistment there expired, if his enlistment had expired possibly that would be some problem but if his discharge hadn't been executed, his status wouldn't be changed and there you have a further illustration of the inappropriateness of this Uniform Code of Military Justice as an instrumentality of dealing with civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.545" offset="26600615">Now, let's go to some documented history again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.738" offset="26621409">The last civilian woman tried by military tribunal in the District of Columbia was Mrs. Surratt in 1865, and Mrs. Surratt did what Mrs. Covert did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.358" offset="26691835">She got a writ of habeas corpus from a judge here at the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="6652.702" offset="26717226">And now, what was the response that the Government made to that judge's writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Mrs. Surratt?</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.588" offset="26752752">An executive order signed by the President with suspending the privilege of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.563" offset="26776680">That is in -- then fit from stenographic report of the trial of the Lincoln conspirators at page 250, not in the Blumenthal letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.775" offset="26817536">Pretty shocking, isn't it, pretty shocking that when the judge issues a writ of habeas corpus in a specific case that he's met with an executive order suspending the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.519" offset="26856511">But wouldn't it be more shocking if a woman were now to be tried by a court-martial in the District of Columbia with the blessing of this Court and its approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="6702.026" offset="26914503">If Your Honors please, I've tried to argue this case with some degree of objectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.134" offset="26982943">I've tried to put out in mind as nearly as I can the callous and somewhat obtuse cruelty with which these two women were treated because I felt that I could best discharge my duties to this Court as well as my duty to them by dealing with this as a question of constitutional law which calls for research and reflection and cogitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.244" offset="27127453">I can't conceal my concern over the seriousness of what's involved because this -- this is about as fundamental an issue as has ever come before this Court and certainly more vital and fundamental in the constitutional sense than any that's been here for some years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.995" offset="27222434">And it's fundamental and vital because it poses in start immediacy the question of how far we may properly brace ourselves to withstand an assault from without and yet perhaps sow the seeds of our own disintegration within.</text>
            <text syncTime="6804.270" offset="27323476">Because we have here, I think for the first time the question involving the impact on the one hand of the supposed needs of the garrison state upon on the other the immutable principles of a free nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.680" offset="27413128">That's a quotation, “the immutable principles of a free nation,” not from the writings of some cloistered libertarian philosopher, but from the institution of the order of the Cincinnati which was founded in 1783 by the revolutionary officers who had pledged their lives and shed their blood that this country might be born.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.301" offset="27519603">And I think we will be aided in the resolution of that problem by considering two sentences from the late Mr. Justice Cardozo's immortal classic, “The Nature of the Judicial Process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.402" offset="27608001">The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles by enshrining them in Constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection, a body of defenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.858" offset="27725866">By conscious or subconscious influence, the presence of this restraining power, aloof in the background, but nonetheless, always in reserve, tends to stabilize and rationalize the legislative judgment to infuse it with the glow of principle, to hold the standard aloft invisible for those who must run the race and keep the faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.622" offset="27828893">If Your Honors please, I have been enrolled among the body of defenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.110" offset="27850836">I hope this Court will keep the faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="6951.265" offset="27911544">I should like to call attention first to one statement of defendant's counsel that these women in 1789 would be entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6969.390" offset="27983956">There is no basis for any such statement where a crime of this character committed in a foreign land that there wouldn't be any provision for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6983.491" offset="28040380">If they have been tried in many of the countries that are involved in this problem of the 63 various locations where we have our armed forces, there would be no jury trial over the laws of those countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.086" offset="28114777">There would be only question that we have here would be only whether they should be tried under the laws, whatever they may be of that foreign country or whether they would be tried by the provision that Congress has made for their trial in court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.847" offset="28209863">There is no question but what in many cases that character of the trial if they would be -- they would obtain by reason of the request in military to obtain jurisdiction and have a court-martial would be infinitely more due process, more of a fair trial than they would have in many of the different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7051.824" offset="28313725">That is not true with regard to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.157" offset="28331071">It's probably not true in Japan in view of the Revised Code of a criminal law that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="7066.196" offset="28371195">But there is no question under the law at what -- at the time, 1789 would be no jury trial whatsoever for these women in foreign country by reason of their American law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7091.623" offset="28472968">There is a difficult problem in regard to the question in appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.951" offset="28506300">And when change occurred in our national history, we believe from our research that is set forth in the briefs that for a great period of time, adds up to about Ex parte Milligan in fact there wasn't any question of what the right to trial in the field in regard to dependents and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="7126.103" offset="28610894">It was clearly recognized, the court-martial under the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.931" offset="28642137">We quote a -- an opinion by J. Holt, the Judge Advocate General, November 15th 1866 in which he says, “It is held by this bureau and has been the general usage of the service in times of peace that a detachment of troops as an army in the field went on the march for the post remote from civil jurisdiction and that is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="7165.354" offset="28767838">It has been a custom and is held to be advisable that civil employees, settlers and camp followers, when guilty of crimes known to the civil law to turn the parties over to the Court's rule of sanity in which the crimes were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7181.961" offset="28834294">For minor offenses against good orders and discipline, it has been the custom to expel the parties from the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.668" offset="28865118">If however, it is sought to punish civil employees in New Mexico for crimes committed at a post where there are no civil courts of which -- before which they can be tried, it is held that they can be brought to trial before a general court-martial as they must be considered as serving with an army in the field and therefore within the provision of the 60th Article War.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.952" offset="28978280">Now, after Ex parte Milligan, we set forth the opinions of the Judge Advocate General.</text>
            <text syncTime="7225.109" offset="29006911">There was a change in the attitude, but that didn't change what the practice and treatment was as a matter of history in the country prior to that time, and although that case did not hold in regard -- had no holding in regard to courts-martial because it dealt with the military commission, it did nevertheless cause the military the Judge Advocate Generals to take a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="7256.662" offset="29133134">But if you examine what they were considering, they were considering the persons in charge of military cemeteries, and civilian employees working in connection with the quartermaster, and those were entirely different cases from these questions involved in the case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.094" offset="29254865">It was generally recognized at that time too that the element that was necessary in regard to civil jurisdiction had four in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="7299.943" offset="29306169">That is that there'll be no civil jurisdiction available.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.409" offset="29320067">It had disappeared throughout the country, and as a matter of fact, there was civil jurisdiction available throughout the land and the country had progressed to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7314.390" offset="29363952">So that it wasn't possible after that day to find an area where you had a military force who is out in the field under the definition and there was no civil jurisdiction available.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.620" offset="29448903">We think that in the consideration of the question of the Necessary and Proper Clause that the Constitution of the -- the Constitutional Convention, very carefully considered how they can control the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.913" offset="29514104">And that in developing the various provisions of the Constitution, different ideas were advanced as to how they should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="7360.418" offset="29548168">In fact, there were different resolutions in which they want to limit the army, standing army to 2000 men and all kinds of proposals because of the abuses that they were resenting in -- at the hands of the British.</text>
            <text syncTime="7378.556" offset="29620684">But all of them were rejected and it was finally determined that the method that would sound by which to control this problem of the military was to place it in the hands of a legislature, of a legislative branch of Congress that would respond to the will of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7398.728" offset="29701350">And all of the other proposals were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="7402.289" offset="29715560">But in the explanation that Hamilton gave of the reason for the selection of the -- of that type of control in -- in the Federals, he made it very clear that the purpose was that no one could possibly foresee all of the problems and exigencies that a country would face in its defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7427.351" offset="29815871">And therefore, that it should be -- the power should be broadened up to be adoptable to the various contingencies that might occur over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7438.490" offset="29860383">And a perfect example of that as I see it is the Air Force where there is no predictions, no provision of any character in the Constitution that would contemplate or expels up the naval force, expels up land forces that nobody referred in anyway to an Air Force and yet certainly, it's -- we can't question of what this military courts-martial have jurisdiction over the Air Force.</text>
