            <text syncTime="4.465" offset="17763">There's one other brief reference that I want to make in connection with the contract in 1951, September 24th, 1951, whereby the Government is expecting to take over the operation of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.610" offset="94354">And that is the case of Nebraska against Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, wherein the opinion was written by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.275" offset="141061">That was the case -- a suit of Nebraska against Wyoming to determine the rights of Nebraska and Wyoming in the waters of the Laramie River, I believe, and Nebraska had claimed that Wyoming was making excessive appropriations of the waters of the river in that State to the detriment of appropriators in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.731" offset="266867">The -- the United States intervened ultimately in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.895" offset="287556">They hadn't done so when it originated but it did before its final conclusion and set up their rights which they claimed to exist by reason of the ownership of the water as a result of the construction of reclamation works and reservoirs in Wyoming under the authority of the Wyoming irrigation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.605" offset="402390">It was held in that case that to allocate water rights in an interstate stream to the several states in nowise interferes with the ownership and operation by the United States of the storage and power plants, works and facilities constructed by it on the stream pursuant to the Reclamation Act or under that Act, the water does not belong to the United States but it's appurtenant to the land served by the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.105" offset="544392">There are -- there are two reports of that case as Your Honor will recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.441" offset="557662">The first one was back 10 years before the one in which Your Honor wrote the opinion and in the -- in the first report of the case, Colorado had not been made a party and the United States had not intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.194" offset="616699">And Nebraska in -- and Wyoming in that case was insisting that Colorado was an indispensable party and I think that the United States was too, but anyway consist -- that -- that Colorado was and the Court held there that Colorado was not an indispensable party because no relief was asked against Colorado and there were no allegations that Colorado had done anything to the detriment of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.520" offset="734041">And the United States after it came in set up that it owned the water rights by reason of owning the project facilities that were constructed pursuant to the reclamation project in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.130" offset="792451">And this Court held that they didn't own the water rights and that the allocation of the rights in the river to the several States in nowise interfered with any rights of the United States because the United States didn't own the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.095" offset="848353">The water was appurtenant to the land under Section 8 of the Reclamation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.318" offset="865176">Now, in the case that we got here, the United States doesn't own the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.208" offset="876774">They're just operating the project facilities and that's what they intend to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.424" offset="893597">Incidentally, there's a supplemental contract which isn't in the record other than it appears in the last pleading filed by the defendants in this case, it shows that there is an agreement there that the United States is not going to operate El Vado anyway, except as a temporary and expedient matter in making the pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.881" offset="975517">That is -- appears at page 36 and 37 of the exceptions to the report of the special master in brief and support thereof, Article IV -- Article XIII (a) have said basic contracts should be revised to read as follows, â€œEffective February the 1st, 1955, the United States shall assume the operation and maintenance of the district works with the exception of El Vado Dam and Reservoir."</text>
            <text syncTime="275.891" offset="1103517">Now, that -- that's not in the record and hadn't developed on the hearing but -- but from this last document which is filed by the defendants here, we see that as a result of the negotiations indicting back and forth between the Bureau of Reclamation and the District, the Bureau of Reclamation is living El Vado Dam and Reservoir out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.193" offset="1184705">Now, paragraph (5) is merely to permit them to make certain temporary affairs on the dam, as required to permit the rehabilitation and betterment of the works to proceed without undue interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.612" offset="1234442">During the period of operation and maintenance by the United States that's provided in Article IV, there's a mandatory contract and Article IV says that they're not to operate El -- El Vado Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.428" offset="1277701">The project water including water for Indian lands now served by the district facilities set forth in Article XXXIV of the basic contract and available from El Vado Dam and Reservoir shall be release by the District in accordance with such instructions received in the contracting officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.552" offset="3194149">That is -- unless there were some binding authority or power or some force that could compel with the State of New Mexico to live up to the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.439" offset="3237721">I don't believe that we would get results otherwise because the State of New Mexico was fully informed as to the situation and did nothing about restraining the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District from -- in effect violating the Compact by excessive use of water and by storing the water in these reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.475" offset="3317864">I don't know what the State of New Mexico could have done except call out the militia and they didn't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.547" offset="3338136">So that's why we're in this Court is to try to get something to compel the State of New Mexico to live up to the contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred E. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="858.300" offset="3433117">If the Court please, I -- there's two matters I want brief or to refer to in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.745" offset="3462896">One, ominously contract that we have been discussing here today and the other is the effect of the proposed amended decree in relation to that contract and its connection with the parties that are materially interested in the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.735" offset="3538860">Now, under the prior prime contract of 1951, it is provided in there that the Secretary of the Interior shall require the conveyance of the property owned by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District as security for the loan and reimbursable charge that the District is obligated to pay -- repay on this construction that at anytime, during the course of that contractual relation, the Government may refer that operation maintenance contract back to the District to operate and maintain the district works under the supervision of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.890" offset="3723494">And at certain intervals, the Government may take the operation and maintenance of the district works away from the District and operate and maintain the District itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.330" offset="3777306">Now, based upon that provision of the contract, an amendatory contract was entered into on the first day of February of this year, which provided that the Government would take over and operate and maintain the works of the District except El Vado Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.063" offset="3864242">And as to that, we have construed that contract and I think the Bureau of Reclamation boys go along with me on that that we, as the District now, is operating and maintaining El Vado Reservoir as the agent for the United States Government that we can't release any water whatsoever from the reservoir without instructions from the contracting officer, who is the district official, for the District in which this construction is being carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.323" offset="4029231">Now, with that in view, just briefly I call attention to paragraph (3) of the amended complaint and see just how that could operate in view of the circumstances that I have explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.767" offset="4103001">Paragraph (3), the State of New Mexico and the other defendants herein to be required subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) hereof to release water from storage reservoirs constructed after 1929 in New Mexico above San Mateo, in the amounts and under the conditions set forth in Article VIII of the Rio Grande Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.708" offset="4202789">Whenever at the beginning of any year, the quantity of usable water in projects stored is less than 600,000 acre-feet and the Commissioner for Texas during the month of January in such year demand such a release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.543" offset="4274155">Now, the first of this year, the Commissioner from the State of New Mexico says there's less than 600,000 acre-feet in Elephant Butte Reservoir, you got 50,000 acre-feet in storage in El Vado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.866" offset="4323370">Now, between the first day of January of 1955 and the third day April 1956, I say, "You release all the water you have in storage."</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.507" offset="4381989">The injunction is directed against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.615" offset="4398393">The Court tells us to release that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.073" offset="4412291">The party in charge over the release of the water is the Secretary of the Interior of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.126" offset="4440503">Now, we have that situation, so we find that the authorities indicate that the Court would not enter a decree where it's advocacy depends upon the will of a third party of an -- or any inferior department of the Government and that is the way we look at it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.505" offset="4533917">Now, just one more thing and then I'm through because I think my time is up but Mr. Edwards has gone into great extent explaining the facts in this case and how easy it will be to construe this Compact under the Flood Control Act because he said that's all can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.694" offset="4614687">Now, that is the very question that's been before this Court all the time is the dispute of the parties as to what the Compact means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.929" offset="4655647">Now, here's what Mr. Edwards says it means and you listened to what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.484" offset="4681874">Therefore, when the amount of water not exceeding a 100,000 acre-feet will pass the gaging station that other way, which is the upper most Compact gaging station in the Rio Grande, the State in New Mexico is not obligated to deliver any water was measured into Elephant Butte Reservoir, but when 900,000 acre-feet is measured out of way, then Texas claims 648,000 acre-feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.417" offset="4805590">Now, all through the years, the indent share of the water of the Rio Grande has been charged up against the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District and that is the reason why we show that we are in debt to Texas today if we were given credit for the indent usage, then Texas with the less water under this Compact.</text>
