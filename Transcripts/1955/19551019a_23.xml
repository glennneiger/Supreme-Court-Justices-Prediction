            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="13.636" offset="54544">The Court will recall that Dr. Slochower was being questioned by the Senate Subcommittee when the Court recess -- yesterday afternoon that he had testified that he was not a member of the Communist Party, that he had not been a member of the Communist Party for the years after 1941 and refused on the grounds that his answer might tend to incriminate him to state whether he was a member in 1940 or in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.990" offset="191948">Dr. Slochower stated further that he had expressed himself, I believe, publically in opposition to some communist doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.519" offset="254015">Two weeks after the hearing, Dr. Slochower received a notice from the Board of Higher Education which governs the college in which he work that by resolution he was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.468" offset="341786">He had been working for the city system as an instructor and a college professor, I assume 27 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.322" offset="373238">He had tenure by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.188" offset="396748">I think counsel for the appellee will concede that had Dr.Slochower been guilty of any other wrong doing, he would have been entitled to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.902" offset="451605">Had he perjured himself to use a specific instance given by the corporation counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.305" offset="477205">Had he contumaciously refuse to answer questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.327" offset="493296">Had he been guilty of arson, seducing a student or stealing money from the college, he would have been entitled to a hearing before he could be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.342" offset="537287">But once he invoked the constitutional right, he lost his right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.921" offset="563618">He lost his right to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.204" offset="572813">He lost all of the rights guaranteed him by the statute and the elaborate procedures that have been formulated for discharge of professors by the Board of Higher Education.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.074" offset="2908264">Now, with respect to the statutes offense against the Privileges and Immunities Clause the Section provides for the dismissal of an employee, a state employee or city employee rather who invokes the constitutional right against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.049" offset="2996140">I don't believe the word constitutional is in Section 903 but anyone who invokes the right to refuse to incriminate himself is under the statute to be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.553" offset="3058207">Before this Section was enacted in 1938, the New York constitution read exactly as the federal constitutional provision with respect to self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.768" offset="3143053">The exact language as, Your Honors are familiar is, "Nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."</text>
            <text syncTime="792.364" offset="3169384">That was the New York statute before 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.786" offset="3187043">Now, in 1938 -- that was the New York constitution, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.183" offset="3204702">In 1938, the New York constitution was amended to validate such a law as Section 903.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.892" offset="3247543">The New York constitution now provides, that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, providing that any public officer upon being called before a grand jury, refuses to answer any relevant questions.I'm just reading the relevant portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.899" offset="3311595">Relevant question concerning his office should be removed from office by the appropriate authority and shall forfeit his office at the suit of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.139" offset="3352555">Now, without that change in the New York constitution, Section 903 would have been unconstitutional under the laws of the -- under the constitution of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.803" offset="3411174">I think that as the Court of Appeals has held, one who invokes the state constitutional right may properly be discharged under Section 903.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.638" offset="3466449">But the amendment of the state constitution can certainly not affect the federal constitutional right and it was the federal constitutional right that was invoked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.455" offset="3505737">I think there can be no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.809" offset="3515141">It was specifically referred to in the hearings as the Fifth Amendment right and it was before a federal body, a Senate Subcommittee, the Committee on the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.228" offset="3560908">So, there can be no question but that it was a federal right, in a federal proceeding that was here invoked and because of the invocation of that right, the appellant, Slochower was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.401" offset="3625587">Now, the argument has been made that Section 903 doesn't really inhibit the right against self -- self-incrimination that just imposes a condition on public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.296" offset="3685146">I think the argument is a spacious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.029" offset="3700088">I think that merely because the Section does not say we forbid public employees to invoke the Fifth Amendment that it doesn't have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.968" offset="3751811">It obviously, does have that effect because it is followed by a penal consequence namely, discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.001" offset="3783993">Now, I think, I'll call your attention of the fact in -- in my brief that most of the penal laws of the State of New York and I believe the same is true with the federal laws, do not forbid any particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.301" offset="3845120">They provide that an act shall be punished in a particular manner, the fact that that is merely the provision -- that the provision is merely want for punishment doesn't mean that the State doesn't forbid the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.834" offset="3895275">And so, in this case the State of New York in effect forbids its employees to invoke the Fifth Amendment on paying of discharge from their positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.972" offset="3975837">I think there's also a line of cases to which I have called the attention to the effect that a State cannot impose an unconstitutional condition on a privilege that it is granting the unconstitutional condition in this case, being the condition that one must surrender his constitutional right against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.723" offset="4270811">It think that the regulation is in effect an invasion on the sphere reserve for -- for federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.914" offset="4307592">The distinction, I believe, Your Honor was made in -- in the Mitchell case in that case the -- the question was raised as to whether or not a federal employee in being denied the right to engage in certain political activities was being deprived of state right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.637" offset="4402469">And the Court found, I believe it's on page 96 of the opinion that the state rights were not being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.994" offset="4447922">And so, in this case, I think, you will have a different question of purely state right was being affected by Section 903, as it is a federal right was being affected and I think the distinction is important.</text>

            <text syncTime="5869.993" offset="23479902">He was of the opinion that the Garner case permitted questioning with respect to any prior period.</text>

            <text syncTime="5972.404" offset="23889607">In addition -- in addition in the Garner case, in connection with the -- in connection with the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.886" offset="23919491">It was assumed by the Court that the statement had to be -- that the -- the statement meant that one with knowledge had advocated the overthrow of the Government or has belong to an organization which had advocated the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.772" offset="23975079">In so it was the material and most important factor as the Court later noted in the Wieman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.851" offset="24003396">Now, there is another tremendously important difference between the Garner case and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.939" offset="24027742">And that the Garner case related to a state inquiry with respect to a state matter pursuant to a State Charter Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.692" offset="24058671">I think the difference between that case and the case at bar is probably most dramatically illustrated by a companion case to the Garner case, the Durand case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.494" offset="24105900">Now, before the Durand case came up there had been a prior action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.936" offset="24131709">There were several people in the State of Maryland including Thelma Durand who were running for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.067" offset="24160235">The State of Maryland required that those people state under oath that all people running for office state under oath that they have not been members of organization which where deemed subversive, something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.114" offset="24224392">Now, Thelma Durand and the first of the cases, was running for Federal Government Office, I believe for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.147" offset="24264516">The State of Maryland held that that statute did not apply to her but applied to the other defendants or rather the other petitioners, I'm sorry, who were running for state office alone because have that application been made in connection with federal office it would have been an invasion of the federal sphere of action or an area reserved for the federal domination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.182" offset="24368692">Later when the Durand case came up before this Court, the second Durand case, it was case where Thelma Durand was then running for state office and the Court held that she could, that -- that the State of Maryland could pass regulations controlling state office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.572" offset="24438282">So here, we have statute which interferes with a federal proceeding or with the Government of federal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.065" offset="24476212">And therefore, in that connection the question of reasonableness does not enter but I want to answer my friend's argument with respect to the reasonableness of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.806" offset="24527203">In considering its reasonableness, we may consider several factors (1) the purpose of the statute, (2) the alternative methods and (3) the application to the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.906" offset="24575582">Now, with respect to purpose, my friend says it is to compel cooperation with inquiry relating to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.530" offset="24606093">Well now, the -- the State Government is certainly not without power to compel cooperation, it doesn't need -- this means, namely the deprivation or the limitation of the constitutional right against self-incrimination in point of fact, there have been several later cases where teachers declined to answer whether they were members of the Communist Party and they were removed by the State of New York not because of the violation of Section 903 but after hearings, in which it was determined that they had failed to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.258" offset="24753006">I think that the -- the best answer to the argument of the appellee has made is Justice Roberts in the Schneider case in which he said, “That if one wants to prevent littering in the streets, it's not necessary to limit the right of public assembly to merely pass a law preventing the littering or forbidding or punishing the littering of the streets.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.024" offset="24852062">In this case, if they want to root out communist in the public school system, they have a perfect means of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.488" offset="24873900">As a matter of fact, they found that means in the Feinberg law which this Court upheld.</text>
