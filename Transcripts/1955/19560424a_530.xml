            <text syncTime="33.242" offset="132911">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.165" offset="184633">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.670" offset="194664">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.370" offset="213473">This Court, noting probable jurisdiction on January 30th of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.558" offset="234162">The issue in the case is the jurisdiction of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board to investigate and enjoin in a state unfair labor practice proceeding the kind of conduct which the National Labor Relations Board is empowered to investigate and to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.841" offset="315350">The Wisconsin tribunals upheld the state jurisdiction throughout when the appellant here has attacked such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.965" offset="347847">In addition, the States of Texas, Utah and Georgia had filed briefs amicus urging this Court to affirm the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.068" offset="396225">The appellant is a labor organization certified by the National Labor Relations Board to represent the employees of the appellee, Kohler Company, for purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.380" offset="445440">The certification followed a regular federal statutory representation proceeding and the certification issued on June 19th of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.465" offset="493819">On April 5, 1954, a strike commenced the -- at the Kohler Company following unsuccessful negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.608" offset="546377">The employees of the Kohler Company picket at the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.468" offset="565812">On April 15, 1954, some 10 days after the commencement of the strike, the Kohler Company filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board charging the appellant and others with unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act which is the Wisconsin labor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.092" offset="664346">The gist of Kohler's complaint was that the appellant and others had engaged in mass picketing in the obstruction of egress and ingress in the picketing of employees' homes and threats of violence and violence and in the obstruction of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.064" offset="728189">It was alleged by the Kohler Company that by so doing, the employees of the Kohler Company have been coerced, employees who did not want to work, but who -- who did not want to strike but wanted to work and that other people, in addition, were prevented from having access to the premises of the Kohler Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.059" offset="808229">On May 21st, 1954, the Wisconsin Board entered an order finding the appellant and others to have committed these unfair labor practices and directing them to cease and desist from committing them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.267" offset="869042">This order of the Wisconsin Board was enforced by the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County, Wisconsin on August 13, 1954, and by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin on May 3, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.316" offset="929228">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin in its decision took cognizance of the fact that the business of the Kohler Company affected commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.793" offset="979069">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin also took cognizance of past and pending assertion of jurisdiction by the National Labor Relations Board over the labor relations of the Kohler Company, both in representation and in unfair labor practice proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.345" offset="1057332">The holding of the Wisconsin Court was that although the Taft-Hartley Act regulated a union unfair labor practices, nevertheless, the action of the Wisconsin Labor Board constituted a valid exercise of the State's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.155" offset="1128594">I should like, if I may, to -- to well briefly on the N.L.R.B.proceedings of which the Wisconsin Court took cognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.092" offset="1180317">There were two representation proceedings, one of which I've already mentioned that resulted in the certification of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.977" offset="1207902">In addition to that, there was an unfair labor practice case decided by the Labor Board on April 12, 1954, and enforced by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the decision being reported at 220 F.2d, page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.851" offset="1283344">In addition, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint on October 26, 1954, that is to say, some six months after the commencement of the strike, this case is N.L.R.B.Case 13-CA-1780.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.242" offset="1364950">Now, it's indicated that N.L.R.B.proceeding resulted out of the same strike which precipitated the State Board proceeding here involved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe</label>
            <text syncTime="355.820" offset="1423256">That, Your Honor, is a proceeding against the company on charges filed by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.257" offset="1444989">The charges are refusal to bargain, discrimination, and other forms of interference and coercion of the employees of the Kohler Company.We have added, if the Court please, to our record as Appendix C excerpts from the pleadings of that case, and we are asking the case to take judicial notice of those pleadings, they -- that those pleadings are not in the record necessarily because the state proceeding preceeded the federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.314" offset="1585215">We do not believe it is inappropriate for us to ask the Court to take notice of this pending proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.846" offset="1619383">The significant thing, we believe, about this still continuing federal board proceeding is that the Kohler Company, in that case has pleaded the same conduct of the appellant in defense of the federal unfair labor practice charges which conduct formed the basis of the State Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.508" offset="1734008">We have reproduced, as I said, those pleadings in the appendix, and on page 17 (c) of our brief, there is a -- the relevant excerpt then our brief is the green document.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.496" offset="1793881">The Kohler Company alleged in that case, that is the federal case, that the union was not bargaining in good faith in that beginning April 5 and continuing to date and engaged in supported, urged, and fostered, coerced of an illegal conduct including interfering by force, threats, intimidation and mass pickets with persons desiring to pursue lawful work and employment for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.588" offset="1886250">Attempting by such means to prevent lawful work, I shall not continue reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.127" offset="1904431">I shall simply say that the conduct there pleaded is precisely the same conduct with which we were charged in the state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.036" offset="1940062">Now, the first thing which becomes apparent from the state of affairs --</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.594" offset="6166361">We sought to defend in the state proceeding on the basis of certain course of conduct of the Kohler Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.210" offset="6212754">And indeed, from the comment of the Circuit Judge that he would much rather be sitting in equity, it appears that -- that there was some merit to our claim, but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin told us that this conduct of the Kohler Company could not be considered unless we have filed our own unfair labor practice charge against the Kohler Company before the Wisconsin Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.065" offset="6340232">In other words, it seems to be the position of the State of Wisconsin that not two simultaneous unfair labor practices, but three and perhaps even more are inappropriate way of handling this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.456" offset="6401776">Now, one additional comment ought to be made and that is that the appellees in this case are claiming that this is the only kind of unfair labor practice which is also regulated by the federal Act which the State Board is free to deal with in a state unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.640" offset="6506475">And because it is perfectly plain from the decisions of this Court that any other unfair labor practice subject to federal regulation is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.447" offset="6565721">And there can, I respectfully suggest, be no doubt that the kind of conduct involved in this case is subject to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.452" offset="6613786">It is to be perfectly plain that Section 8 (b) (1) (a) of the federal statute which added unfair labor practices was intended to bring the kind of conduct here involved subject to the investigative and regulatory powers of the federal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.202" offset="6692780">In other words, if this conduct have been proven before the federal board, the federal board could have entered virtually the same kind of order that the State Board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.354" offset="6741368">And may I suggest that the federal remedy is not at all cumbersome and slow and ineffective, because the federal statute contains a provision authorizing the general counsel of the federal board to secure temporary restraining orders prior to final adjudication where he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.990" offset="6831856">So that insofar as dealing with this kind of situation in an unfair labor practice proceeding is concerned, the federal proceeding is speedy and expeditious too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.919" offset="7543641">The -- among the conclusions of law of the Wisconsin Board is a -- is a conclusion that the appellant had violated a section of the Wisconsin statute which prohibit -- which makes -- makes it an unfair labor practice to coerce employees in the exercise of their rights established in Section 111.04.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.451" offset="7645727">If one goes to Section 111.04, one finds that that section is almost a verbatim duplication of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act which establishes certain employee rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.428" offset="7709675">And I believe that the entire order of the Wisconsin Board is directed towards the protection of employees in the exercise of their statutory rights exactly as the federal board would enter such an order under like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.800" offset="7787102">And that insofar as the Wisconsin Board -- Wisconsin Board might regulate traffic why this I suggest is in -- an incident to the protection of employee rights and the same incident would flow from a federal board order because the federal board, under Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the statute, has held all of the conduct which the Wisconsin Board found to have taken place here to be a federal unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.063" offset="7916251">There is -- there is no conduct here which the federal board has not, in one case or another, regulated as a union unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.270" offset="8005068">Now, this overlap is admitted, at least, by the Kohler Company in their brief, although, they do suggest that the Wisconsin Board could or did do some things that the federal board could not have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.493" offset="8073927">But we believe that -- at the point where there is this impingement upon the federal board's jurisdiction why the state action cannot be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.829" offset="8115304">For example, Wisconsin points out in its brief that unlike the federal statute, the state statute proscribes unfair labor practices by any person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.531" offset="8186044">Well the fact of the matter is that that particular section of the Wisconsin statute was not invoked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.764" offset="8218958">Again, Wisconsin claims that the Wisconsin statute prohibits individuals and members of the union as well as labor unions and their agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.731" offset="8278831">The fact of the matter is that the Wisconsin Board is -- Board's order is directed towards two labor unions, one of whom is the appellant here, the other one being one of its local unions and to the agents of labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.453" offset="8329718">I suggest that the Wisconsin had wanted to avoid conflict with the -- the federal board, they might have limited their regulation to that of individuals who were not agents of a labor organization, because that, the federal board couldn't regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.496" offset="8397949">Now, with respect to the continued validity of state labor laws and the continued jurisdiction of state labor boards, we think that the Congress in the federal labor statute has spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.731" offset="8474854">The Congress, we believe, has told us in Section 10 (a) and in Section 14 (b) of the federal Act where and under what circumstances state labor boards were to have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.244" offset="8524904">Section 10 (a) is the so-called session proviso which authorizes the federal board to cede jurisdiction to state labor boards under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.018" offset="8576000">Section 14 (b) is the section of the statute which specifically saves the continued validity of state regulation of the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.230" offset="8620826">We think that those two sections taken together represent the legislative judgment as to the circumstances under which the state labor boards were to have jurisdiction.</text>

          <turn speaker="kurt_l_hanslowe" startTime="2262.819" stopTime="2646.725">
            <label>Mr. Kurt L. Hanslowe</label>
            <text syncTime="2262.819" offset="9051220">Now, I should like, if I may, to direct my attention to some decisions which the appellees have relied upon particularly in support of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.491" offset="9113913">The first of these is one that has already been mentioned, that is the Allen-Bradley case which is of particular significance here because it involves a substantially similar order of the Wisconsin Board and it involves the same provisions of the Wisconsin statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.689" offset="9190713">Now, the Court has -- The Court in the Allen-Bradley case said that we decided this case this way, we authorize the -- we -- we find the action of the State Board authorized because the conduct involved is not regulated by the Federal Labor Act either by protection or by prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.907" offset="9279530">And of course, significantly, that case came up in 1942 and predated the Taft-Hartley amendments which added federal regulation of this kind of conduct to the federal labor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.392" offset="9349538">And the Court has, on subsequent occasions, characterized its holding in the Allen-Bradley case in the same way in the case of Hill against Florida which followed very shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.798" offset="9395096">The Court said in Allen-Bradley, we found the conduct to be unregulated federally and the -- in Anheuser-Busch, the Court said about Allen-Bradley, the Court held that such conduct was not subject to regulation by the federal board either by prohibition or by protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.948" offset="9467716">And the Briggs-Stratton case, the famous Quickie Strike case stands for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.018" offset="9496033">That case followed Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.204" offset="9504810">But again, the holding of the Court was, that the conduct involved in that case was not subject to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.521" offset="9538038">And in the opinion of the Court, it is said that the federal board is without expressed power to regulate this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.543" offset="9570116">In this case, we say, there is such expressed power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.551" offset="9590178">We have already discussed briefly the Laburnum case as we understand that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.916" offset="9615569">And I -- the case was characterized in Weber- Anheuser-Busch this way in Laburnum which involved 8 (b) (1) (A) of the federal statute, the same section of the federal statute here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.266" offset="9668963">In Laburnum, the violent conduct was reached by a remedy having no parallel in and not in conflict with any remedy afforded by the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.247" offset="9712953">And as I read the case, there seem to be substantial agreement between the majority and the dissent of Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.155" offset="9756526">That while the state remedy was being upheld because it did not duplicate or conflict with the federal remedy, if that the contrary had been the case, a different result would have obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.273" offset="9820996">The -- the Court said in the Laburnum case to the extent that Congress prescribed preventive procedure against unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.432" offset="9861642">The Garner case recognized that the Act excluded conflicting state procedure to the same end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.638" offset="9886511">And I repeat again, Laburnum did involve violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.893" offset="9911484">And Mr. Justice Douglas, in his dissent said, on the facts found by the state court, the labor organized and the union have committed an unfair labor practice under 8 (b) (1) (A) by using threats and to force of the picket line to make employees join the union contrary to their desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.686" offset="9970730">A state court or a state labor board could not enjoin that conduct as Garner against Teamsters Teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.123" offset="9996434">Now, Mr. Justice Douglas differed it from the conclusion of the majority that the State could superimpose an additional different remedy, but there seem to be substantial agreement that there could be -- that there could be no duplication of the federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.830" offset="10067278">One more case I should like to refer to, it's the Algoma Plywood case which is repeatedly cited by appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.034" offset="10100088">That case involved -- in -- in that case, the Court upheld application by the State of Wisconsin of its regulation of the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.308" offset="10145228">And we believe the Court did so for a very good and plain reason, namely, that Congress in Section 14 (b) of the statute has said that the States may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.923" offset="10199667">In -- the Court in that case said Section 10 (a) of the federal Act which is the section that empowers that federal board to regulate unfair labor practices, Section 10 (a) of the federal Act was designed to preclude conflict in the administration of remedies for the practices prescribed by Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.194" offset="10272705">And in this case, we do have Section 8 practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.120" offset="10296424">Thus, we believe that the instant case involves an area which is subject both to substantive and to procedural regulation under the Federal Labor Act by the Federal Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.575" offset="10362253">For that reason, we do not believe that the States may regulate the same conduct in substantially the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.828" offset="10399242">And I believe that I might appropriately close by referring to the language of Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday in the Mine Workers case when he said that withdrawal of state power has been found to exist where state law makes inroads on the primary jurisdiction which Congress has -- with which Congress has invested the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.664" offset="10514599">We believe that the Wisconsin Board thus make such inroads here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.505" offset="10533930">Indeed, we believe that the Wisconsin Board's order substantially duplicates the kind of order which the Federal Board might have entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.347" offset="10565381">And in consequence, we do not believe that the States' action can stand.</text>
