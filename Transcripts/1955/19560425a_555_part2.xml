            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Wilmer, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="16.020" offset="64052">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.597" offset="86309">I think I would like to make it plain at the outset that the only reference to monitoring which is found in the statute is that provision which authorizes the Commission to spend money to acquire stations for monitoring purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.731" offset="134896">That ends the reference to the authority of the Commission to monitor the extent of that authority and the purposes for which it may monitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.208" offset="172826">Now, from that the Commission draws a broad power to supervise all communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.894" offset="195500">From that, it would draw the broad the power to listen in on every conversation for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.544" offset="222145">We say it is just as reasonable because in that same statute, which gives the Commission the authority to buy stations or to maintain monitoring stations that gives them the authority to employ lawyers and buy law books.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.722" offset="278883">If the mere authority to buy something means that it is to be used without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.955" offset="299781">We say that by like analogy since it has the authority to buy law books and employ lawyers, it can go into a business of running a Court or it can go into a business of practicing law because, simply, the authority to buy law book and to employ a lawyer, there you have a physical setup for a full blown court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.287" offset="377104">By like analogy, we say that in our part of the country anyway we have what we call "junior patrols" who are at schools for the purpose of slowing down speeders and so on, they are -- a nature of a public relations matter of -- of controlling traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.337" offset="445336">They are authorized to use police whistles.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.554" offset="458188">So, we say that if the legislature gives them the authority to use the police whistle by like analogy, they have the authority to become a complete police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.724" offset="494864">So, it is our position, if it please the Court, that before -- before such an abrupt and far reaching departure should be read into the Communications Act as it is here contended for the Government, it should clearly appear in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.912" offset="555572">It should appear that the Congress had that in mind to give them this general broad supervision which they are claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.721" offset="582844">And I say, if it please the Court, that you can read the Communications Act from one end to the other and all you can find in it is a negativing of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.156" offset="616594">As I have previously demonstrated, the only reports which they are supposed to give a better investigations are to the parties infected.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.103" offset="652330">In the statute which does for what purposes they may revoke a license, it specifically limits that authority to violation of a act treaty or convention binding upon the United States and which</text>

            <text syncTime="302.116" offset="1208424">Let me go further, Your Honor, in the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.168" offset="1220650">It takes the position that because this is a crowded frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.066" offset="1236219">Now, where they get the information that the radio (Inaudible) is so crowded, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.470" offset="1257848">I assume that several members of this Court including Mr. Justice Douglas probably would be a little reluctant to believe that the either ways around (Inaudible) are jammed with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.704" offset="1302779">But be that as it may, they take the position that because they say this is a crowded frequency, therefore it is necessary that the Government supervised carefully, not only, not only the use of it in the sense of assigning the frequencies, but apparently they go further and say that they're also to listen in to see if the communications made are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.380" offset="1393476">In other words, they say that the access that you shall keep your communications to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.253" offset="1412911">So, I supposed that the position of the Government is correct here, we will have the revision of that slogan we heard during the war, “is this script necessary” to “is this speech necessary”?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.091" offset="1460349">It seems to be their feeling that not only are they authorized to listen in but having listened in, they're authorized to punch a button and say, "You're talking too much."</text>
            <text syncTime="375.612" offset="1502354">Well now, if it please the Court, I know it is not unusual for federal agencies to reach out and grasp for power, grasp for additional employees and additional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.649" offset="1538508">But I say this, that before what this Court has denounced as morally wrong, should be read into the Communications Act the right to intercept, to spy, to put their key to the -- their eye to the keyhole, there should be some clear language from the Congress in there which indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.578" offset="1634220">There should be something from the Congress here which shows an intent that the Federal Communications Commission should be given this authority to read -- I mean to listen in to every private communication that is by radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.617" offset="1686465">And I say that that can't be found there, if we go, if it please the Court, back to the -- the conditions under which a station license maybe revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.876" offset="1731500">As I have said, we have one if it operate in violation of a treaty or act which the Commission is authorized to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.916" offset="1763579">Now, if the Congress thought that they were going to be listening in and picking up a lot of monkey business go along in a criminal way.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.632" offset="1794508">Certainly, the Congress would have given the authority to revoke a license if it was engaged in any criminal activity and yet they limit it specifically to a specific violation of a specific limited type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.919" offset="1843618">They go on as failed to carry out a lawful order of the master or person lawfully in charge of the ship, willfully damaged to a permitted radio operators to be damaged, transmitted superfluous radio communications or signals or communications containing profane or obscene words, language or meaning or has knowingly transmitted volts of deceptive signals, wrong call letters interfered with the communications that attempted to obtain or obtain and assist another maintaining a license by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.391" offset="1961482">Well now, this goes right back to what I said a minute ago, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.872" offset="1983425">They may revoke if you have transmitted a superfluous communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.574" offset="2002233">So, I suppose that the Federal Communications Commission is going to tell us that that gives them the authority to listen in on every use of the radio and decided whether the communication is superfluous or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.650" offset="2046537">And I say that when that authority is granted, you have indeed opened up the Pandora's box for the Commission to pry into the private affairs and to set about the business of regulating what everyone is saying and everyone is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.807" offset="2099200">Now, if we turn to the provisions which relate to the revocation of an operator's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.178" offset="2120620">We find the same complete dirt of any intent on the part of Congress that this -- the Commissions had supervised and in the sense of spying and determine whether in every instance the use of the radio is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.709" offset="2170776">Why will they revoke an operator's license?</text>
            <text syncTime="545.353" offset="2181329">Fault statements knowingly made in the application because of conditions coming to the attention of the Commission which would want it in refusing to grant a license or permit on an original application.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.187" offset="2224692">Now, that is the closest the entire statute comes to giving them the authority to revoke a license of an operator for improper use, illegal use and yet, thus it not see --</text>

            <text syncTime="570.496" offset="2281953">It is -- it's in our brief, Your Honor, it is "Any station license or construction permit maybe revoked because of conditions coming to the attention of the Commission which would warrant it in refusing to grant a license or permit on an original application."</text>
            <text syncTime="586.584" offset="2346318">Now, that is the closest, if it please the Court, that you can search this whole Act through and find any intimation whatever that the Congress regard the Federal Communications Commission as another adjunct of the Department of Justice or as a potential adjunct or arm of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.377" offset="2421447">Now, certainly, if this business of spying as they're talking about had been carried on for so many years and was so well known to the Congress and was so calmly, certainly the Congress in enacting this statute would have given some recognition to that and would have given some recognition to whether or not they can divulge that information and yet it did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.176" offset="2508696">Now, I may make one more point.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.462" offset="2525832">The language of the statute with respect to what inspection rights they have is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.448" offset="2561776">Have authority to inspect all radio instillations associated with stations required to be licensed by any Act or which are subject to the provisions of any act, treaty or convention binding on the United States to ascertain whether in the construction, instillation and operation, they conform to the requirements to the rules and regulations of the Commission, the provisions of any act, the terms of any three-year convention binding on the United States and the conditions of the license or other instrument or authorization under which they are constructed, installed or operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.371" offset="2685388">I said initially that inspect an installation means simply that a physical inspection and while I do not pretend to stand here as an expert in radio, I do know that you can go into a radio station and you can tell what frequency is operating on, you can tell what power output it is using and you can tell everything else that is required to conform with this.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.099" offset="2792385">I have to read that into it because nowhere in the Act thus the Congress seemed to intend that the Commission is to supervise the use which is made of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.808" offset="2831151">It seems very significant to me, if it please the Court, and I frankly know no way to explain it why the Congress did not see fit to give that authority that is here sought by -- at your hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.141" offset="2880470">I see no reason why the Congress shouldn't perhaps had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.265" offset="2893009">But our position is that Congress did not do so and since the Congress plainly did not intend to give it to them, they are not here in very good -- in asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.349" offset="2929371">Now, the license which is involved here and mind you now, this -- this authority is to inspect to see if we're operating pursuant to the license which we get.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.428" offset="2969704">The Government has quoted the permissible operations, speech or the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.435" offset="2985691">Stations license under this part may transmit the following types of communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.848" offset="3003350">I'm reading from page 14 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.062" offset="3012232">"Any communication related directly to the safety of life or the protection property and communications considered essential to the efficient conduct to that portion of the enterprise which the licensee is eligible to hold a station license under this part, subject to the condition that harmful interference is not cause to safety communications of license -- station license under this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.713" offset="3102824">In other words, their authority to inspect is spelled out here, this is what they can inspect for to see if, one, if it is being operated so that the condition -- (Inaudible) condition harmful -- that harmful interference is caused the safety communications of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.406" offset="3177535">Now, I would like to save a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.846" offset="3183282">I'd like to say just one thing in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.133" offset="3196447">I believe that there is involved here regardless of Your Honor's decision unless you of course decide that the Communications Commission is a super -- a detective agency and authorized to freely monitor and freely divulge if that is not your conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.370" offset="3269381">And you do conclude that because of the absence of the operator's license during the time of the first two interceptions, then we say that we complied with the rule which this Court laid down the first Nardone case and which the Second Circuit adopted in the Kaplan case and that is this and incidentally it was known to the Government because the Ninth Circuit had already ruled as they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.643" offset="3366557">We clearly showed that the Government used the interception which was made on the 18th of September in securing the indictment that they used it in questioning witnesses and they proposed to use it on the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.502" offset="3425907">The indictment specified that on the 18th of September, we did an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy and therefore, we must conclude that testimony was transmitted to the grand jury which resulted in that indictment because otherwise it couldn't have indicted on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.764" offset="3487033">On the other indictment, a count was laid on the 18th of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.848" offset="3507304">So, clearly, a testimony on that was -- was given to the grand jury and Mr. -- the gentleman from the FCC who testified said that he gave them a full account of what he done.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.833" offset="3555265">It is our position that when we have brought back to the trial court's attention, we had clearly tied as this Court expressed it, the taint of the wrongful evidence to the Government's case had clearly showed that it was embodied in any part of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.042" offset="3608137">The burden then shifted to the Government to demonstrate to the Court that it had a case which was free of that taint which demonstrated that it could go forward and manifest in this case, it couldn't go forward with the indictment because they were tied to the fact that they used the illegally intercepted information in obtaining the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.487" offset="3677936">So, we say that if the interpretation in the Kaplan case of the language of this first Nardone case is accurate that the trial court in any event was correct because the Government made no effort to (Inaudible) the good from the bad, made no effort to show that he had a case without the illegally intercepted information.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.429" offset="3769678">No effort to show that the indictment was not the fruit of the illegally intercepted communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.249" offset="3864973">In a rather restrained way, Mr. Wilmer is used to volley unpleasant language about the actions of the Federal Communications engineer, morally wrong eavesdropping either the keyhole.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.484" offset="3937907">This is a kind of language which has been used with respect to wire tapping and I think it is rather important, right at the beginning of this case, that we make it clear that this is not a wire tapping situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.406" offset="4005616">The -- the petitioners were sending out messages from their antenna like spokes from the hub of a wheel that extended 70 miles in each direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.768" offset="4051069">They were operating on a frequency which had been -- which they were authorized to use by the Federal -- Federal Communications Commission as being in the public interest, convenience and necessity and they were subject to the regulation of the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.606" offset="4118361">They didn't have a right to be left alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.401" offset="4129541">They were required to be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.646" offset="4138527">They did not have privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.778" offset="4147096">They were shouting from their rooftops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.598" offset="4158380">Now, the reason that I -- the reason that I emphasize this is that seems to me important that we should realize that this is not a case like the illegal searches and seizures cases like the wire tapping cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.729" offset="4206864">This is not a case of invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.984" offset="4227866">And I say that because I would like to argue this case against Mr. Wilmer and not to have to argue against Mr. Justice Brandeis and Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.974" offset="4267886">It seems to me that it is easier to take this case in its own setting than to take it in the setting in which Mr. Wilmer is trying to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.017" offset="4304039">Now, I must also note a -- a slight disagreement with Mr. Wilmer with respect to the facts as to the purpose which the record shows was being followed by the engineer in undertaking this monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.858" offset="4371331">Now, I agree with him that the engineer went from Los Angeles to -- to Arizona for the specific purpose of monitoring the -- the transmission of this station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.094" offset="4428278">But he testified in this very case that his purpose was to discover whether or not radio facilities were being used for an unauthorized purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.787" offset="4487105">I read those words from page 35 of the record where Mr. Stratton was testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.201" offset="4516780">The reason I -- the reason I emphasized that is that whether or not it is essential to this case, I do not know, but I think that the case is easier if we understand that here, the engineer was carrying out Federal Communications Commission purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.214" offset="4588774">That's what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.068" offset="4600268">There is no dispute that his -- his testimony wasn't shaken in anyway in -- in the course of the hearing and in fact, it is supported by the fact that the Commission itself instituted administrative proceedings which led to the surrender of the station license and operate its permits on the basis of the things which Mr. Stratton heard and also that there are these indictments for violations of the Communications Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.941" offset="4715729">So, it seems clear that we do not have the Communications Commission being used as a cat's paw by somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.588" offset="4750315">We have a situation where they were carrying out their authorized duties and in the course of that, came across evidence which was -- which showed a violation of another criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.157" offset="4828578">Before I get to the law and I also like to mention a word about the nature -- the nature of this station license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.925" offset="4859611">This was called a special industrial service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.938" offset="4883749">It was a license to be used in connection with the Sugden's farm operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.260" offset="4904960">They operated a cotton farm in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.281" offset="4925022">Now, not only where they license under a law which imposes regulations including the right of inspection, so that one might say that they consented, if you please, to inspection but also, they were operating on what is known as a "shared frequency."</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.780" offset="5023033">Industrial -- industrial stations do not have any exclusive right to the frequency which they use in their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.308" offset="5061172">Other industrial stations in the same area and which would interfere with, actually with their -- with their operations are authorized to use precisely the same frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.443" offset="5113731">There's a common experience in riding in -- in taxicabs which have radio facilities to hear communications coming in on the -- on the taxicab radio, not only from the cab's own station but from other stations which are sending messages to other cabs because they, like the industrial stations, share the use of a frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.698" offset="5218743">And the reason I -- the reason I press this is that it seems obvious that the Sugdens must have known, they could not help but know, not only that their messages were subject to being heard by federal communications monitors but they were subject to being heard by other industrial users who are using the same -- the same frequency as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.386" offset="5309544">They were in effect talking on -- on a party line, on vast party line with any number of people listening in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.843" offset="5347370">And the question is whether in a situation like this when -- when one of the persons listening in was a Federal Communication's officer authorized to monitor whether he may lawfully turn the information over to other authorities for use in the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.196" offset="5432738">The first issue in this case is really whether or not Congress authorized the Commission to monitor and this, I submit, is purely a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.964" offset="5487804">There is no question here of an illegal searches and seizures whether the Olmstead decision is right or wrong, I take it that no one could doubt that Congress could if it decide in the course of it's regulatory authority conditioned the grant of radio facilities on the condition that they be subjected to monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.931" offset="5611624">And the question -- and that that wouldn't involve any Fourth -- Fourth Amendment question, the question is did Congress in this case authorized the monitoring?</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.979" offset="5651853">We find the authority in section 303 of the Communications Act, which we have printed at pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.943" offset="5707755">We find it in the power to inspect radio facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.703" offset="5730743">To us it seems clear that to inspect radio facilities, one should use his ear as well as his eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.164" offset="5776614">Inspectors of wine probably use the sense of taste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.070" offset="5792183">Inspectors of perfume would use the sense of smell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.924" offset="5803677">Inspectors of -- of radio in order to know what is going on must use the sense of hearing and therefore we would read the -- the term inspection, the right to inspect is giving them the right to listen to as well as the right to look at.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.438" offset="13117649">The court below said, even though radio communications may not be -- that the -- the monitoring of radio communications may not be used except for purposes of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.006" offset="13179925">They said in this case, "We do not have the type of communication which deserves protection," and the court below said, "That it didn't deserve protection because there was not a license operator which is admitted by counsel for petitioners," at least with respect to the interception on the first three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.439" offset="13265711">On the fourth day, the operator was licensed and the court below said, "It's necessary to separate the evidence which came in on the first three days of monitoring and the evidence which came in on the fourth day of monitoring."</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.558" offset="13314194">They sent it back to the court below to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.186" offset="13332689">We think the Court was right in saying that whatever protection is given by 605 with respect to the communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.832" offset="13359229">It cannot be thought to apply to a communication which is itself violative of the Commissions own authority because the very purpose of 605 is to preserve this valuable right to give its dignity and there is no dignity in an illegal transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.834" offset="13459331">But we think the court below didn't go as far as it could in this respect because the broadcast -- the -- the transmissions of this radio station were unauthorized, not solely because these people didn't have an operator's permit, but even more so because they were not using it for the limited purpose for which it was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.715" offset="13550759">It was authorized for the use of farming purposes and these people were using it in order to conceal -- now, in -- in here I say a word of caution, I don't know the facts, but according to the indictment and if -- if it's proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.299" offset="13605094">But according to the indictment, they were using this radio for the purpose of concealing aliens which were illegally in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.870" offset="13643442">It's not an unusual thing in the law when a -- a privilege is given to some relationship for that privilege to be stripped away when the relationship is abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.865" offset="13703419">Perhaps, the classic example of it is the attorney-client privilege which is a privilege which we all treasure highly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.217" offset="13740826">But from the beginning, it has been denied to those who would use the attorney-client privilege to cloak a crime or to cloak fraud, fraud itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.122" offset="13796415">If the courts will strip from -- from that privilege, that privilege away from attorney-client and much lesser thing to feel that when the valuable airways which are limited in use, which are crowded, by and large they're crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.161" offset="13880633">If that is not only used not for the purpose which it is designed but used in order to violate a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.612" offset="13946358">Thus, in this case, we do not have a wire tapping case, we do not have an illegal search and seizure case, we do not have an invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.205" offset="13988780">We have a case where these petitioners were transmitting messages to an area of 15,000 square miles for everybody to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.583" offset="14054296">Now, it's a strange thing if everybody can hear, but if a federal officer hears and hears that there is a violation of a law going on that he may not use that information in order to bring the petitioners to justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3683.071" offset="14732225">There is nothing to imply, Your Honor, that this was intended to the public -- for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.835" offset="14751242">And I say, and again, as I said before, that just because stealing is easy, doesn't dignified or justified and just because it's easy to intercept doesn't justify interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.872" offset="14787396">That -- that seems to be counsel's argument that because this is so easy for people to listen to therefore, 605 should be repealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.195" offset="14860748">Counsel has said that because of the illegal purpose, the protection 605 should be stripped from this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.304" offset="14937130">You can't permit agents of the Federal Communications Commission to themselves decide a man is guilty, try him in their own mind and say he's guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.294" offset="14973074">Therefore, we will intercept and paddle and justify doing it by their test because as I have said supposing that the testimony is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.157" offset="15012571">They have attempted to do it and the jury acquits them and they're then found not guilty and the crime wasn't committed and yet the interception has been held and illegally.</text>
