            <text syncTime="10.991" offset="43886">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.886" offset="103445">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.392" offset="113476">I am appearing for the petitionrs Sears, Roebuck and his Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.314" offset="129254">It is agreeable to the Court, I propose to reserve about 10 minutes of my allotted time.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.216" offset="160810">This case rises on a petition for certiorari to review the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which denied a motion to dismiss an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.997" offset="211905">The motion was taken from an order of the trial court, the District Court to dismiss parts of a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.793" offset="243148">That is the appeal that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.214" offset="252761">The motion of the petitioner, sorted a lack of jurisdiction on the ground of a lack of the -- of meeting the requirements of Section 1291 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.938" offset="295706">The Court of Appeals below, relying upon the fact that an order in the form of Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, had been entered by the District Court held that it was unnecessary to consider whether or not the requirements of Section 1291 were met undependable.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.090" offset="372297">We believe that the court below, errored in its interpretation of Rule 54 (b) and misjudged the relationship of the Federal Rule, the Section 1291 of Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.236" offset="424856">The background of this matter in detail is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.011" offset="440007">The respondents, an individual and a corporation wholly controlled by the individual respondent, filed a complaint in the six counts against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.782" offset="483056">Count I set forth the allege violations of the Sherman, Clayton and Robinson-Patman Act and demanded travel damages cost and permanent equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.915" offset="531644">This was the general antitrust count.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.000" offset="547944">Count I in a specific allegation stressed the size and power of the petitioner, Sears, and charged that the petitioner had committed a series of individual wrong or tort against the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.662" offset="598622">The Count I also charged that he was -- these were a part of a very general plan to drive the petitioner out of all businesses now and in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.133" offset="636447">Thus, paragraph 11 of Count I alleged, "Beginning in 1949 and continuing down to the date of the filling of this complaint, Sears has been engaged in a continuing attempt to destroy each and every business owned, controlled, or managed by Mackey.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.935" offset="707709">And thereby, to punish Mackey for refusing to deal with Sears on terms dictated by Sears and to deter others from refusing to deal with Sears on terms dictated by Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.207" offset="752744">After several paragraphs of allegations with respect to specific wrong, paragraph 22, more or less, have the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.825" offset="787226">All of the four set Acts and practices have been performed by Sears pursuant to its continuing plan to destroy each and every business in which Mackey has engaged or may attempt to engage.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.680" offset="838635">In the subsequent counts by re-alleging the counts, the allegations of Count I singly or in combination, the respondents purported to multiply their clauses of actions or claims with respect to the number of laws violated, the claims themselves and of course the amount of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.621" offset="922436">Count II, thus, based almost entirely on cross references to specific paragraphs of Count I alleged unfair competition by the petitioner with a lamp business conducted by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.425" offset="977607">Count III, similarly based on cross references to Count I, charged interference with profitable contractual relation to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.656" offset="1018567">Count IV, similarly established by cross reference to Count I, alleged unfair competition and we believe a possible patent infringement with respect to a tool business conducted by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.610" offset="1074364">Count V, which originally charged Robinson-Patman the antitrust violations was abandoned by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.957" offset="1103726">Count VI, which substantially reincorporated all of the fact to the allegations of the forgoing counts, charged an overall general tort of an attempt to destroy all businesses of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.133" offset="1156493">Again, Count VI was based upon the notion of a plan linking together all of the specific episodes charged in paragraphs to Count I.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.957" offset="1195781">Upon the petitioner's motion in the trial court as amended to dismiss parts of the complaint, the trial court did dismiss Count I, II and part of Count VI without lead to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.009" offset="1248026">The parties are thus now that issue in the trial court on Counts III, IV and the remaining part of Count VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.170" offset="1284598">The order of dismissal by the District Court took the form of an order under Rule 54 (b) as amended of the Federal Rule, that is to say the Court found that there was no just reason for delay and directed the entry of its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.266" offset="1344993">The petitioner, thereafter, filed a motion to dismiss the appeals, which set on the ground, that statutory finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.258" offset="1372996">A final decision in the sense of Section 1291 of the Judicial Code was lacking, not withstanding the entry of judgment from the form of Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="353.230" offset="1412911">This motion was denied by the Court of Appeals solely and exclusively upon the ground that the District Court's order entered in accordance with Rule 54 (b) forms was conclusive as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.857" offset="1475396">It should be noted that briefs were filed by both parties, an extensive argument was held in the Circuit Court upon two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.879" offset="1503504">The first issue was as to the effect of Rule 54 (b) order, was it necessarily final for appeals' purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.488" offset="1533910">This is a question of interpretation as the question of relationship of the Rule to the jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.263" offset="1560973">If the Court found that a Rule 54 (b) order was not final necessarily in the jurisdictional sense, a second question was presented in the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.539" offset="1602142">That question was whether, in -- in the light of the construction of 1291 which this Court and other Courts have given, whether the decision dismissing parts of the complaint in the court below was final under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.665" offset="1658567">That is a question entirely apart from Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="419.290" offset="1677061">Now, reviewing the conflicting decisions in a various Circuits, as to the effect of Rule 54 (b), the Court of Appeals below decided that an order entered in accordance with its form was controlling an appellate jurisdiction, thus, the Court found it unnecessary to decide the second question which had been argued their finality in the 1291 sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.059" offset="1768176">In its decision, the Court accepted the views of a majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Bendix Aviation Company versus Glass case and the views of a panel of the Second Circuit in Pabellon case, Pabellon versus Grace Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.366" offset="1829407">These cases have been extensively cited in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.256" offset="1844976">The court below recognized that this interpretation of Rule 54 (b) to use its own words "automatically and conclusively" fixed appellate jurisdiction in accordance with the direction of the District Court Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.985" offset="1911850">Also, the Court construed the opinion of Judge Clark on this question in the Pabellon case which opinion it adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.128" offset="1948421">To the effect of that, "A final order under Rule 54 (b) relieved the Court of Appeals from the task of making an independent analysis to determine whether or not the order was, in fact, final and appealable."</text>
            <text syncTime="503.724" offset="2014877">In view of its decision, as I've said, the court below explicitly refused the pass upon the question whether the elements of statutory finality required by Section 1291 were present in the dismissal order of the trial court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.770" offset="2079033">In this Court, we believe the issue is simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.126" offset="2092408">It can be stated as one or two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.235" offset="2100872">As two issues, the first question is whether an order on one or more claims in a multiple claims case, complying in the form with Rule 54 (b) automatically becomes appealable at the Court of Appeals level.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.141" offset="2160536">A second issue which we think is closely related to the first is whether Rule 54 (b) is interpreted to reach this result as the Court of Appeals below did, whether the rule is then valid in view of the congressional requirements with respect to jurisdiction set forth in 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.796" offset="2227096">Now, we think the second question is illusory that is to say the validity of the rule because it's our view that the proper interpretation of Rule 54 (b) is that it does not confer appellate jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.931" offset="2303687">I think the question here is different because the Court of Appeals had it before two questions, namely, the effective Rule 54 (b), and secondarily, the question of whether or not the judgment in the trial court was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.989" offset="2355931">They bypassed the second question entirely by their construction of Rule 54 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="838.298" offset="3353182">Now, in our reply brief, we set forth the reasons why we believe that question is more properly before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.987" offset="3391948">The argument for the petitioner here under Rule 54 (b) question can be summarized very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.062" offset="3420160">Section 1291 which sets forth the requirements for appellate jurisdiction and has been a part of the Judicial Code, I think, since this -- far back in 1789, state the following, the Court of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the District Court, then I omit a part, except where direct view -- where direct review may be held in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.590" offset="3518276">This Section is the implementing section reflecting a -- a long-standing policy against piecemeal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.518" offset="3550041">Such appeals are barred because they tend to fragmentized litigation because the important thing in -- upon appeals conserve the time and energy of the appellate court rather than the serve the convenience of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.671" offset="3606674">The rule is intended to make sure that litigation comes up at a matured stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.131" offset="3624438">It's intended to make sure that the appellate court has perspective with respect for the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.487" offset="3641887">And to some extent, it's intended to prevent appeals whereby the development of litigation, a matter may become moot or subtle.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.817" offset="3675220">Historically and consistently, Section 1291 has required two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.503" offset="3701969">The first thing required has been that there be a final disposition of a subject matter by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.232" offset="3728927">Now, this is a requirement of internal finality, finality in the sense that trial court has finished with the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.503" offset="3754005">It has reserved nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.777" offset="3759020">It's gone as far as it will.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.837" offset="3767275">The Court has exhausted its will with respect to the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.342" offset="3781277">The second requirement, and this lies well outside the scope of any rule of the District Court procedure, is that the matter disposed of by the trial court, the matter which is internally final, must be a distinct judicial unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.478" offset="3849822">It must separate and independent of other manners remaining to be decided by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.474" offset="3869884">Neither Rule 54 nor indeed any District Court rule can do more than establish the existence of the first element, internal finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.674" offset="3898619">That is a final disposition by the trial court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.795" offset="3911158">That is what the rule is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.555" offset="3922129">For convenience, we refer to this as internal finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.735" offset="3934877">Rule 54 (b) cannot and does not purport to bind the hands of the appellate court in determining external finality whether an appropriate quantum of litigation has been concluded, but differently, whether the decision discloses of a separate and distinct matter arising from a separate and distinct transaction or occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.970" offset="4023798">As Judge Hastie has put these two requirements of Section 1291 in the Bendix case, "Two things are necessary for a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.527" offset="4062041">The District Court must take all the steps necessary to complete its action with reference to the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.655" offset="4082521">And in addition, the subject matter litigated must have enough scope to satisfy the statutory conception of final decision."</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.521" offset="4122018">Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules for the District Court, practice and procedure in the District Court were governed largely by the Conformity Act which looked at the state practice and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.734" offset="4162873">At that time, generally, such practice and procedure did not recognize a liberal joinder of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.590" offset="4190354">Ordinarily, you could not combine equitable and legal complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.755" offset="4210939">Third party practice was severely restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.680" offset="4226717">As a result of the forms of pleading and practice prior to the Federal Rules, the general rule under Section 1291, the jurisdictional section, was sometimes stated to be that the judgment in question must dispose of all issues as to all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.162" offset="4300591">Even before the Federal Rules, however, in those relatively rare cases under the practice and procedure which prevail them, different matters were combined in the same action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.624" offset="4346462">In such cases, partial judgments were sometimes recognized to be final in the appellate sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.268" offset="4369032">I refer the Court to the case of United States versus River Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.684" offset="4390661">With the introduction of the Federal Rules, new conditions of practice could be anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.906" offset="4411559">It was a liberal joinder of actions, equitable and legal actions could be freely joined, the third party practice was loosened up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.939" offset="4439667">As a result, it could now be anticipated that what before was an unusual situation might now become common.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.884" offset="4471536">That is, that different claims and separate clauses of action might be united with a single pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.507" offset="4494002">Original Rule 54 (b) provided as a rule of District Court procedure that the trial judge could enter a judgment upon one of several claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.765" offset="4530991">The rule had no particular reference to appellate jurisdiction nor was there any such intention on the part of the -- its draftsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.492" offset="4561920">It was not construed in the Courts to affect appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.298" offset="4577176">The rule was held valid by this Court in Reeves versus Beardall, a decision which, I believe, occasioned no great surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.469" offset="4609776">In Reeves versus Beardall, the plaintiff filed a three-count complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.198" offset="4628689">First count was upon rights on a promissory note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.580" offset="4642273">The second count was a count under a contract to maintain certain will provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.556" offset="4662126">The third count was a count for money damages against the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.010" offset="4679993">The second and third counts were dismissed in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.768" offset="4695040">It was held in this Court and the courts below that the order was final as to the dismissal of the second and third counts because those counts dealt with matters which were separate and distinct from the remaining count, the promissory note count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.054" offset="4748121">And each count arose out of a subject matter wholly and distinct, wholly separate and distinct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.967" offset="5215817">They go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.612" offset="5218429">They also maintained that as a result of the Reeves and Beardall decision, authority has been given to vary appellate jurisdiction in accordance with the discretion of the trial judge, namely, there is authority to give the effect to the amended rule which the court below didn't give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.395" offset="5285512">I might say that the position of the respondent's on the effect of the Reeves case that flatly contradicted by Judge Clark on the Second Circuit Court, a judge whose views in this area are otherwise strongly recommended by the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.011" offset="5432007">The judge then went on to say, "This must necessarily be told because the rules do not affect jurisdiction or deal with the powers of appellate courts."</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.112" offset="5472444">The Reeves case, in our view, marked no change in the statutory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.481" offset="5493864">Even if they had marked some change, the Reeves case is hardly authority for an amendment which allegedly grants discretion to the trial judge, to decide whether to create appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.608" offset="5538377">As this Court said recently in Baltimore Contractors verus Bodinger, piecemeal appeals will not be permitted in the discretion of a trial judge upon a finding of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.319" offset="5585189">I'd like to turn the Collins versus M.G.M., which is stressed again by the respondents on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.680" offset="5602638">They maintained the decision there, marked the power of the Federal Rules to alter conceptions under Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.525" offset="5634090">In the Collins case, a complaint was brought in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.745" offset="5646942">The first alleged copyright infringement and the second alleged unfair competition in appropriating the title of a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.996" offset="5675886">A motion to dismiss the first count was granted and the question was whether that dismissal was a final order in the statutory sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.852" offset="5707337">The Court held that that order was final because the transactions involved in the first and second counts was separate and different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.915" offset="5735654">The Collins case did have the effect in the Second Circuit of reversing some prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.563" offset="5758224">However, the reversal was not a product necessarily of the introduction of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.636" offset="5782465">The Second Circuit in the Collins case clearly points out that it is bringing its views into line with those of several other Circuit Court opinions and the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.628" offset="5818410">And I refer to the Eight or Nine Circuit Court cases and Supreme Court cases cited in the Collins as a precedent for its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.312" offset="5845159">All of these cases are pre-rules cases and they can hardly indicate the effect of the rule to change the interpretation under Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.617" offset="5886433">To demonstrate how little the Collins' results depended upon the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.942" offset="5903673">I'd like to take one of those cases as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.592" offset="5914331">That's Klever versus Seawall, it arose in 1894, involved a three-count complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.028" offset="5940036">The first count was an action for rejectment, the second count was a count for trusts with damages, and the third count was a count for petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.847" offset="5971383">Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff on all counts by default but with respect to counts two and three, further action remained to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.957" offset="5999804">Therefore, no sense could the order with respect to counts two and three be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.061" offset="6020180">However, the Court held that the Circuit Court of Ohio in 1894, that the judgment on the first count was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.953" offset="6047765">There was no reason to delay the appeal when the subject matter had been finally disposed of and was unrelated to other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.020" offset="6072007">We submit that this result is very similar to the result in Collins versus M.G.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.861" offset="6091442">Similarly, (Inaudible) a Fourth Circuit Court case decided in 1904, four counts were represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.741" offset="6126864">Three counts -- three of the four counts were dismissed and the Court found that these counts were sufficiently unrelated to the remaining count that a final order could be entered with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.332" offset="6189244">And one of the principle problems under the original Rule 54 (b) was the question of what the trial court intended when he made a partial judgment in accordance with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.809" offset="6235220">These are the problem of internal finality in our terms, then the judge mean to indicate by the form of his order that he was through with the action or was his order intended to reserve some powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.234" offset="6288927">A great deal of litigation arose from ambiguities in the form of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.301" offset="6305123">In some cases, the right to appeal was lost because the parties had not realized that a partial judgment was intended to be and was final in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.213" offset="6340754">A notable example of this unfortuned situation was the Dickinson versus Petroleum Conversion Corporation case decided by this Court in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.659" offset="6378580">To prevent these difficulties and hardships, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules prepared and this Court promulgated an amendment to the rules effective in 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="3965.647" offset="15862491">And to discuss that, which we feel is conclusive of this case, I should like to discuss the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.399" offset="15889554">Some comment has been made by petitioner really directed to the arrangement of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.217" offset="15912856">The claims involved here are separate and distinct under preamendment or original Rule 54 (b) standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.160" offset="15948591">Three historical events took place, so to speak, physical facts, this is not one fact with several cause of action alleged out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.873" offset="15983491">Mr. Mackey was in the lamp business in 1949 and Sears drove him out of it, so it is alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.291" offset="16013061">Subsequently, in 1951 and1952, Mr. Mackey was -- had a an advantageous contract for commissions, and Sears, by means of a threatened boycott of the other contracting party who also (Inaudible) with Sears, forced or induced the breach of that contract, a second physical historical event.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.079" offset="16112222">At -- at or about the same time, Mr. Mackey threw a time saver, a corporation wholly owned by him, was driven out of the two businesses or sought to be by means of unfair competition in top of an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.377" offset="16165407">And as I suggested in the Court of Appeals, that it's somewhat -- is this Mr. Mackey had been selling on one street corner in 1949 and been hit by a Sears truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.496" offset="16201979">And in 1950, standing on another street corner was hit by another Sears truck, and in 1951, standing on a third street corner was hit by a third Sears truck and at that point scratches his head and besides there may be something more to this than just an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.360" offset="16265404">And that's what's involved here, you have three very separate incidents of business oppression, predatory conduct which are setup as common law causes of action with diversity, and a fourth cause, an antitrust cause that this was all entered as an over all scheme of predatory conduct with the specific intent to drive him out business, to discipline Sears suppliers and to monopolize trade of commerce in the area operated in by Mr. Mackey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.929" offset="16391628">This is not just a question of arrangement of -- of count.These are separate physical events as I conceive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.742" offset="16430916">Now, under the standards of Reeves versus Beardall and Collins versus Metro-Goldwyn Pictures, it is perfectly clear that the order entered by the District Court in this case would have been appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.255" offset="16492983">It satisfies the 1291 requirements and there's no reason for this Court to concern itself with the question that may be raised by the case that needed to be argued after as to what the effect of the amended rule is in a case which may not have been presented in appealable order under the rules prior to the amendment in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.319" offset="16597264">That is to say, here we have an order, I don't care what system you use, take petitioner's view, take Judge Clark's view, take Judge Hastie's view, take the view of Gold Seal and then the in the Court of Appeals for the district that this order would be appealable and what is all is shouting about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.078" offset="16672287">Now, I'm perfectly willing to defend, what I would call a modified affirmative view that is to say that the Courts of -- that the rule has some affirmative effect and perfectly willing to defend the rule and the original rule as being consistent and not in violation of Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.167" offset="16756611">But I say to the Court that -- that is all unnecessary to the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.551" offset="16778136">Here is an order clearly appealable under the original rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.119" offset="16796421">The magic phrases have been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.260" offset="16813035">There's no suggestion of the Court that views this discretion in finding no just reason for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.976" offset="16831843">There's no suggestion that multiple claims aren't involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.341" offset="16845322">Here is the very kind of case for which both the original rule and the amended rule were intended to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.384" offset="16877505">And I say that this Court can dispose of this case without reaching the amended rule question just as I say and I will not urge here out of respect for the Court wish to determine the Rule 54 (b) question that I believe that this order may be appealable under Section 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.012" offset="16952007">But I would like to put in my defense of the affirmative view modified, as I say it must be, to require the Courts of Appeals to do just what they have been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.457" offset="17001744">And the -- and the cases in which they have been doing it are set out that the pages and the footnote at pages 38 and 39 of respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.422" offset="17041659">The Courts have been reviewing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.155" offset="17048555">There's no automatic and conclusive, you couldn't take an order like the order in Cobbledick versus United States put a 54 (b) finding on it and come in to Court and ask to be heard by Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.417" offset="17093590">That is not a final order under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.013" offset="17111980">Now, I should like to say that on the affirmative view, so called, there really is no technical conflict in the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.793" offset="17151164">The Flegenheimer decision according to the -- to the Second Circuit itself is no longer the law in that Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.462" offset="17177809">There is no other decision, I say decision technically, which upholds the negative view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.647" offset="17214485">Judge Hastie in the Bendix case, on the contrary, imposes the same kinds of test that I'm urging this Court to state for the Court of Appeals and the District Court as to what the amended rule does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.726" offset="17270805">In other words, Judge Hastie, a petitioner has pointed out, says you have to have multiple claims.You have to have a certain quantum of litigations, scope of the claims as he put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.689" offset="17314691">He finds in the compulsory counter claims case, these multiple claims are not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.755" offset="17334962">I don't need to reach that question and I understand that that question or part of that question before the Court in the case that follow, that finding not only a single claim was involved, he says that the Court has no power under 1291 to confer appellant jurisdiction, if you will, and that is the same kind of analysis that I'm urging on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.556" offset="17430152">In the Gold Seal case which is the only other court as (Inaudible) so-called negative view.</text>

            <text syncTime="4994.895" offset="19979494">I also want to state that in our view, I may have said or alluded to this obliquely, I would like to state that in our view, the Court of Appeal, perhaps, somewhat unknowingly applied this same test that I'm urging to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.333" offset="20049293">That is to say, including the Bendix opinion at page 45 of the record, the Court recognizes that this necessity for multiple claims to be found for final judgment on the particular claim and for the correct exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.023" offset="20148036">Now, I say and urge this Court to state clearly for the benefit of -- of those of us who come again on these problems that that is the correct test that ought to be applied in these 54 (b) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.276" offset="20209058">And I also urged the Court not to take the invitation proper to it by petitioner to send this case back to determine whether the Court of -- to ask the Court of Appeals to take another look at it on the test which this Court enunciates before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.195" offset="20296725">There's nothing going to change in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.674" offset="20306651">We have the complaint, the District Court order, the motion to dismiss the appeal, and it presents solely a procedural question and this Court's rule, there are no local law questions or fact questions which the Court of Appeals can help you on and I might say from the fact that there are or have been very few 54 (b) cases since these cases were docketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.248" offset="20396931">The Courts of Appeals are awaiting your decision to help them in this 54 (b) area and you -- it seems to ask that you ought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.403" offset="20437577">I do not do more than allude to the fact that we have been seriously prejudiced by the long delay that has come already and that would seem to us that there'd be no reason to postpone that ultimate determination of this any further so that we could get the trial as promptly as possible on this case that should have been on now for almost three years which may seem a short time in relation to the case that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.610" offset="20542380">But so far as we are concerned, it's a very long time and we're still a long way from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.451" offset="20569757">In our view, the affirmative -- the -- the order of the District Court was clearly appealable under preamendment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.517" offset="20602044">It's clearly appealable under preamendment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.208" offset="20616777">It's clearly appealable under the amended rule without regard to what view you take of the amended rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.761" offset="20639033">You can take the negative view, the affirmative view, Judge Clark's view, Professor Morris view, Judge Hastie's view, the Gold Seal's view or my view or any other view you can think of and I'm still appealable.</text>
