            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="107.967" offset="431856">For several districts, several divisions in one district is relatively an easy figure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="112.372" stopTime="369.944">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="112.372" offset="449411">Yes, but in any event, there is no such right in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.428" offset="469682">Now, the basic reason that justifies that is that the Government has an initial choice of venue where you have multiple venues as frequently happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.014" offset="520046">The Government can choose the venue in which it is to file its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.470" offset="541780">And presumably, at least, we all hope that the Government's initial choice of the venue in which to bring the case will be based upon considerations of proof and considerations of fairness which should always appeal to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.660" offset="618580">Now, let us follow this through if we may -- if I may and direct your attention to Rule 48 at the bottom of page 3, which governs dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.155" offset="672601">Rule 48 was also announced venue principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.461" offset="693812">Rule 48 provides that the Attorney General may, by leave of court, file a dismissal of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.402" offset="733518">Prior to this rule, the Attorney General could, at any time prior to trial, dismiss an indictment without leave of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.796" offset="779180">This rule, the provision in this rule, requiring leave of court or the dismissal of an indictment was inserted by this Court, the Advisory Committee's recommendation left that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.002" offset="839993">In other words, the dismissal was to be solely the prerogative of the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.331" offset="869251">The requirement that leave of court be obtained was inserted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.908" offset="891611">It is our position that Rule 48 (a) requiring leave of court was intended to require that the District Court, when the United States Attorney file a motion for leave to dismiss, that the District Court would then look at the problem presented and would exercise real and not mechanical discretion so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.505" offset="1013969">In other words, that he would make a judgment on the facts and on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.563" offset="1042181">And it is our contention that in this case, the district judge erred in permitting dismissal for the purposes that were clear here for the reasons that were clear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.330" offset="1121280">And let me state it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.303" offset="1133192">Looking at Rule 48, looking at Rule 21, the issue in this case as we conceive it is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.400" offset="1173525">Should the District Courts give leave to dismiss an indictment for the purpose of permitting the United States Attorney to make a second choice of forum in which to prosecute for an identical offense because the United States Attorney is wholly displeased with the forum provided in a transfer order and because the United States Attorney wishes to negate that transfer order duly entered on evidence and as to context, that I take it is the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.318" offset="1377176">I used the word -- I carefully used the word “negate the order”, that is what the Government says on page 72, I think, it is of the -- of its brief, was the purpose in this case for dismissing the first indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.587" offset="1454289">We have used the less kindly but I believe accurate word of circumvention that --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="369.944" offset="1479680">You argue this on the premise, straightforward premise, that there was -- although there was an exercise of discretion here, this was an abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.164" offset="1524611">You don't stand on the proposition that there was a failure to exercise discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.893" offset="1551569">It's a little difficult to know from what Judge Kennerly said, just exactly how it appeared to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.331" offset="1581244">He said that in 24 years on the bench, I have never refused the -- a -- an effort on the part of the United States Attorney to dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.773" offset="1623040">He said, “I've done that both before and since.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.267" offset="1637042">The rules -- the rules seem to indicate that I have some discretion here and if and to the extent that I have a discretion, I'm going to exercise it to dismiss here because” he said, and this is important, he said, “because the defendant has not shown reasons why it should not be dismissed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="432.728" offset="1730873">Now, we submit that that is an improper standard in the context of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.256" offset="1760967">But you -- you must contend it before, as I should think, in order to urge a reversal or rather to urge that he committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.649" offset="1806524">You must urge that he didn't exercise and allowed the discretion, otherwise, the remedy assuming the agreement is to send it back to him to exercise this right.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.662" offset="1846648">Precisely, Mr. Justice, and I'd like to make that perfectly clear since it has been the subject of a good deal of discussion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.996" offset="1875905">Let us assume that Justice -- that Judge Kennerly had made it perfectly clear that he was exercising his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.577" offset="1910282">Let's assume that.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.589" offset="1918328">If he had exercised his discretion to permit dismissal on the facts of this case, it would be our position that that was error.</text>
