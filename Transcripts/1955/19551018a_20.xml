            <label>Mr. Jay O. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="25.139" offset="100519">-- of this case to illustrate certain points.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.783" offset="203128">This case comes before the Supreme Court on certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.250" offset="232908">It involves income and excess profits taxes for the years 1940 and 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.858" offset="259344">The actions for both those years were previously consolidated and it appears as one proceeding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.420" offset="285675">The order of certiorari has limited the review by this Court to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.561" offset="314201">The first point, which I will discuss, involves the following question where petitioner's transactions in commodity futures, which are not true hedges, subject to the capital gain and loss treatment of Section 117 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.063" offset="400196">Well, were they are ordinary gains and losses and to be treated the same.Point two which Mr. McCain will discuss is an entirely distinct point.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.476" offset="449829">That point is -- are commodity futures securities within the meaning of Section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and subject to the so-called wash sales provisions thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.452" offset="521718">As I have stated, I will address myself solely to the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.251" offset="544914">The facts with respect to this issue are conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.074" offset="572291">They start or are caused by the great drought of 1934 and 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.057" offset="612206">These severe droughts caused a great shortage of corn in our midwestern farming areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.564" offset="650240">The result of that was that the price of corn rose substantially during the years 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.444" offset="689737">Now, the petitioner here is a nationally known processor of raw corn, perhaps the largest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.707" offset="722756">Petitioner's main products consist primarily of starch, corn syrup, and cerelose, which is a refined corn sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.217" offset="768836">Its byproducts are feed and corn oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.818" offset="787226">Now, cerelose, the refined corn sugar competes with cane and beet sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.816" offset="815229">It is used in canning, candy and other commercial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.715" offset="838844">The great droughts of 1934 and 1936 as I have stated caused the price of corn to rise and therefore the price of petitioner's product, cerelose.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.802" offset="895164">The result was that petitioner actually lost money during 1937 on every sale of cerelose.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.623" offset="934452">It had risen out of line with the price of cane sugar and beet sugar because Your Honors will recognize that the same area affected by the drought with respect to corn was not necessarily affected with respect to raising of cane sugar or beet sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.861" offset="1011357">Petitioner was faced with a serious situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.966" offset="1031837">Its annual grind in those years about 35 million bushels and rose gradually during the years here in question to almost -- to over 60 million bushels in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.807" offset="1095158">Petitioner could only store 2,300,000 bushels in its facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.904" offset="1123579">This is equivalent to about three weeks grind.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.461" offset="1145835">The problem then faced petitioner's officers what to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.303" offset="1177182">They envisaged a plan or a program whereby they would buy corn futures up to the amount of 11 or 12 millions bushels during the year when they were sure in July or fairly certain that there would be no great shortage of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.341" offset="1257326">Their plan was to liquidate that position and thereupon pick it up again in the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.200" offset="1300793">Now, this plan didn't quite work out the way the petitioner had envisaged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.773" offset="1327020">The petitioner had always established for itself a corn futures position but as I say during these years it became considerably larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.487" offset="1385848">When the Commodity Exchange Authority received reports from the petitioner and the petitioner is required to file such reports weekly, the Commodity Exchange Authority objected to the size of petitioner's position and proceeded to bring an action against this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.269" offset="1488980">By the time the action was commenced however and discussions were under way, the war had broken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.278" offset="1525029">The price of all sugars, cane sugar, beet sugar and this cerelose rose rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.290" offset="1561078">The need for any protection had vanished.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.938" offset="1587722">The result was, as seen on the chart which appears at page 8 of the brief, petitioner's position in futures, which is represented by this stippled area, dropped very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.508" offset="1649998">Petitioner, in other words, liquidated the largest part of its futures position.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.138" offset="1688451">I might say at the beginning that it wasn't easy for petitioner to obtain 12 million -- a position of 12 million bushels overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.804" offset="1727216">It had to work its way up gradually and that you will see in this line at the beginning of the chart 7138 as you can see gradually reaching the peak position there.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.931" offset="1775700">And I further state that this chart is cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.451" offset="1797747">The storage capacity is represented by the lowest stippled area.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.601" offset="1818331">The inventory is added to that in this second area and again the futures are imposed cumulatively on top of the stock to show the total long position of the petitioner at any given time during the period in 7138 through to the end of 1942.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.372" offset="1941420">That is the inventory on hand of finished goods and above that the futures position.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.541" offset="1970155">It represents, in other words, a total long position of the petitioner -- of the -- of reason for mentioning that at this time will be brought out later in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.904" offset="2027520">Now, during these years, petitioner had a constant sales policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.298" offset="2061166">This includes the years 1936, right through 1942 and that was this and it is brought out in Exhibit 10 in the record at page 104.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.338" offset="2121352">The customer ordering any of petitioner's products will always receive the lower of the contract price or the market price on the date of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.059" offset="2180180">The lower of the two and this is important in considering the question of hedging which we will get to a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.359" offset="2213407">Petitioner also had the policy of permitting its customers to cancel unfilled orders at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.079" offset="2252278">Cancellations were frequent and unpredictable as the record will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.846" offset="2287282">I believe the -- the record, it appears at page 68 and 69 on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.528" offset="2342034">The Commodity Exchange, as I have stated, brought a proceeding against the petitioner in 1939 to -- charging it with excessive speculation in corn futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.982" offset="2403892">When the war broke out, as this chart shows, petitioner liquidated its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.332" offset="2437224">The result was that the matter became moot and was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.806" offset="2459167">There was no opinion on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.042" offset="2472124">This is brought out by the later facts after the taxable years that after the war when petitioner resumed its buying of corn futures, a similar proceeding was brought against this petitioner and resulted in an order against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.299" offset="2541192">That order is recorded in 13 agricultural decisions on page 1117.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.619" offset="2574420">That case is now on appeal before the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.893" offset="2591556">The -- the Secretary of Agriculture held in that case that petitioner was not hedging and even though as in later years it was brought out, certain additional things were done despite that and I'll bring that out later in the argument, the Court or rather the Commission of the Agriculture Department held that the petitioner was not hedging.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.788" offset="2799073">Well, what is your position, Mr. Kramer, to the petitioner in this case as to whether that was hedged or not in the -- in the case that's on appeal?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay O. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="711.393" offset="2845571">The petitioner in that case points to a different definition of hedging contained in the Commodity Exchange Act which says a reasonable hedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.726" offset="2890815">The facts in that case were dissimilar than in the present case for the reason that after the war, the petitioner developed a method of predicting what its sales would be within an accuracy of 5% as brought out in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.160" offset="2952568">Also, petitioner sold short cane sugar futures and cottonseed oil futures so that it maintained a balanced position.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.331" offset="2989244">I'm getting a bit ahead of myself in defining the hedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.453" offset="3001783">But the -- the effect is that the situation there was quite different than in the tactical years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay O. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="774.024" offset="3096033">Our annual consumption ran from 35 million bushels in 1936 or 1937 to over 60 million bushels in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.207" offset="3156741">Now, this case came before the Tax Court of the United States which held that the corn futures program of petitioner, this area that you see, March futures on the chart, was an integral part of its manufacturing process and that even though this petitioner was not technically hedging, nevertheless, the transaction was subject to ordinary gains and loss treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.536" offset="3298116">The Court of Appeals in affirming went on to say that while petitioner was not hedging, the property was used for essentially the same purposes and should be treated in the same fashion as if it were hedging and accorded ordinary gain and loss treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.992" offset="3379931">The case came before this Court on certiorari because what appeared to be a conflict with the Third, Fifth and I believe the Sixth Circuits, which had held that unless a true hedge were established, a taxpayer could not claim an ordinary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.804" offset="3459135">The Court will recognize it once that we're dealing with the other side of the picture and we will point out empathically I hope at a later point that where the Government is dealing with losses, where the Commissioner is dealing with losses, insist on the test of a true hedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.435" offset="3533740">Therefore, limiting the taxpayer to a capital loss, whereas in this case, the situation is the reverse where it's dealing with a profit, he will say that it's ordinary and -- and forget about the test of -- of the true hedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.395" offset="3605525">Incidentally and fairly on the side, the case because of peculiarity of the excess profits tax law finds the petitioner and the Government in the reversed positions of that which would ordinarily be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.002" offset="3691938">In this case, the Government is contending in effect that petitioner's losses were ordinary losses fully deductible without limit by saying that their gains are ordinary income because there were some years in which we had losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.595" offset="3746377">The reason for that is in the computation of our excess profits credit for the -- is 1936 through 1939, we had substantial losses and ordinary losses would have the effect of reducing our excess profits credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.184" offset="3808653">On the second issue, the Government is also taking a unusual position.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.236" offset="3828924">They are saying that the wash sales provisions do not apply to commodity transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.249" offset="3864973">Now, my argument with respect to point one is divided into two separate and distinct propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.284" offset="3905097">The first proposition is that Section 117 (a) in defining capital assets does not make any exception for assets used in hedging, although it makes specific exceptions in a number of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.268" offset="3981061">I will develop the statutory history of Section 117 to show the specific exclusions to the definition of capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.217" offset="4024842">Our position is there is no statutory justification or any exception in the nature of hedging to any unwritten or implied exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.208" offset="4068728">Our second position, our second line of defense is that even if there is a hedging exception, petitioner's transactions do not fall with any -- within any such unwritten exception to Section 117 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.910" offset="4131631">And therefore, unless it is established that the petitioner was engaging in true hedging operation, its transactions must be treated as capital transactions and the result in gain or loss computed accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.062" offset="4200176">I would like to read if I may because it is so important here, Section 117 (a) because as the Court will see, there's a missing phrase in -- in that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.628" offset="4266423">When I say a missing phrase, I mean that it was never once mentioned either in the Tax Court's opinion, in the Court of Appeals opinion or in respondent's brief except in the appendix when the Section was printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.558" offset="4334132">Capital assets are defined at page 53 of our brief and -- and we are reading from the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, "The term capital assets means property held by the taxpayer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.483" offset="4397871">The next phrase is the missing phrase, "It's parenthetical whether or not connected with his trade or business, but does not include stock and trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which properly would be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property, used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to an allowance for depreciation provided in Section 23 (l)."</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.901" offset="4543530">I would like to go far back into the history of the Internal Revenue statutes and pick up the ancestor of that Section and point out that in 1921, the -- essentially the same definition appeared in the law, we have quoted that definition at page 4 of our reply brief, "The term capital assets as used in this Section means property and acquired -- acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than two years whether or not connected with his trade or business."</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.670" offset="4710609">Again, the missing clause, "But does not include property held for personal use or consumption of the taxpayer or his family or stock and trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would be properly includable in inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year."</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.870" offset="4779468">Right at the start, the definition of capital asset was any assets held by the taxpayer for over two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.881" offset="4815517">This was changed as we will see in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.847" offset="4827324">But right at the very start, Congress sought that to state that they were capital assets whether or not connected with his trade or business and Congress saw fit to make specific exceptions or exclusions thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.516" offset="4890018">And so this concept continued with slight modifications in the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926, 1928 and 1932.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.636" offset="5542452">Now, the first point of law that we would like to make is this, that where Congress sets up a general definition that assets are capital assets and provides for a series of exclusions that there is no room for any other exclusion to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.930" offset="5647673">This is all the more true in the present case because Congress has given this Section a tremendous amount of attention from 1921 right through to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.463" offset="5693753">And wherever shoe was pinched, wherever Congress has thought it necessary, it has added additional exclusions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.266" offset="5824993">Our point then is further emphasized by the fact that Congress was not unaware of the existence of hedging as a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.756" offset="5870968">If the Court will recall, Section 502 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the definition of personal holding company income specifically excludes profits from hedging transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.414" offset="6025613">But the Congress did not at the same time amend Section 1231, which is the successor to Section 117 (a), to provide that assets used in hedging were to be an exception to Section 117 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.720" offset="6130834">In 1934, Congress abolished the two-year rule defining capital assets and thereafter said all assets are capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.686" offset="6182661">The Commissioner's regulations echoed that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.132" offset="6204500">Now, before 1934, this question of commodity futures was academic because commodity futures by their nature matured in less than two years and therefore, no commodity future prior to that time was a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.492" offset="6277956">After 1934, there was no such situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.345" offset="6309303">Accordingly in 1936, the Treasury issued General Counsel's Memorandum 17322, and this for the first time expounded the theory of hedging as insurance and therefore that losses in hedging would result in any ordinary losses in the nature of an insurance or business deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.043" offset="6416091">Significantly, this General Counsel's Memorandum was never promulgated into regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.689" offset="6450678">The normal course of events in many General Counsel's Memorandum is to promulgate it into regulation and then if there is a statutory reenactment at a later date, it is deemed to have received legislative sanction, such is not the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.697" offset="6770730">However, the regulation with respect to 117 (a) which specifically states, the term capital assets includes all classes of property not specifically excluded by Section 117 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.410" offset="6849620">That regulation has appeared in every regulation in connection with every Act since 1934, 1934, 1936, 1938, the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the amendments thereto in 1942 and again the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.702" offset="6926733">I say that that regulation by statutory reenactment has received legislative sanction and that is the point that we are here making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.608" offset="6974380">First, that there is no statutory justification for any implied exception in the form of hedging and that this is confirmed by repeated reenactment of law without making any specific exception for "assets used in hedging”, four words could have changed the problem but they did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.807" offset="7071138">The second point which I would like to make is that even if there is a hedging reception -- exception and we do not concede that there is, the test is whether or not taxpayer was engaging in true hedging operations and not something akin to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.414" offset="7169567">The words of the Tax Court that petitioner's transactions were an integral part of its manufacturing process can be accepted as correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.945" offset="7219722">If you say that everything that a taxpayer does as part of its business, but Congress had specifically stated that assets remain capital assets whether or not used in the taxpayers business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.857" offset="7279386">So I would say that the Tax Court's opinion simply disregards that missing phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.869" offset="7315435">The Court of Appeals in its decision said these assets were used in the same manner as in hedging and therefore we're going to treat them the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.909" offset="7959615">We try to reach the definition of hedging in a series of statements made in our brief outlining the principles of what hedging is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.706" offset="8010815">Hedging is essentially the maintenance of a balanced position which eliminates the risk of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.566" offset="8058253">At page 24 of our initial brief, we make a series of statements which will help define what hedging is as far as tax cases are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.440" offset="8105691">This Court has had occasion to define hedging on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.815" offset="8131187">The initial attempt to define it was in Chicago Board of Trade versus Christie Stock -- Grain &amp; Stock Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.489" offset="8165878">There, the Court said, hedging as it is called is a means which collectors and exporters of grain or other products and manufactured, who make contracts in advance for the sale of their goods, secure themselves against the fluctuations of the market by counter contracts for the purchase or sale as a case maybe of an equal quantity of the product or the material of manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.936" offset="8255739">Now, during the statement of facts, I laid some emphasis on the undisputed fact that petitioner had no fixed prices on the sale of its merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.702" offset="8306730">Petitioner took the risk when it sold that its costumer would receive the lower of two prices, either the contract price or the market price if it went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.340" offset="8353332">Petitioner also allowed its costumers to cancel their contracts wherever they so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.951" offset="8379768">Consequently, when we examine this chart here, these red lines or columns indicating orders are orders in name only, they are not fixed as to price, they are not fixed as to quantity because a costumer finding that the market has dropped may cancel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.426" offset="8473704">He may also take at the lower price and it is for that reason that the Tax Court said, "We are not technically hedging."</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.183" offset="8504633">The Court of Appeals agreed, it says, "We -- that we are not engaging in true hedging."</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.581" offset="8522292">The respondent himself in his brief admits that we are not true -- I am not truly hedging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.830" offset="8551236">But the Court of Appeals and the respondent says it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.753" offset="8570984">It's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.009" offset="8579971">We are doing something in connection with our business here and therefore it's going to be taxed at ordinary income rates and losses are ordinarily deductible, completely disregarding that initial trade in Section 117 (a) which says, "Whether or not connected with taxpayers business.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.013" offset="10203951">The issue turns mainly on whether corn futures contracts are securities within the meaning of Section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.573" offset="10250240">The irrelevant portion of which reads as follows, this is at page 68 of our main brief, Section 118 loss from wash sales of stock or securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.026" offset="10296007">In the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that within a period of 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date, the taxpayer has acquired substantially identical stock or securities, then no deduction for the loss shall be allowed under, in this case, Section 23 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.762" offset="10415020">The evidence in this case shows that the corn futures contract is a document and the contract as Exhibit 14 reproduced at page 151 of the record, evidencing an agreement to buy 5000 bushels of corn or some multiple thereof at a stated price upon delivery during a stated month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.459" offset="10517734">The record shows that large numbers of these contracts were outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.604" offset="10538318">Petitioner alone purchased 824 contracts calling for over 19 million bushels of corn in 1938 and 593 contracts calling for about 14.5 million bushels in 1939.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.541" offset="10670080">All these contracts are identical in a wording, differing only as to maturity date, price and quality and the quantity is always a multiple of 5000 bushels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.973" offset="10707801">Contracts are traded regularly on the Chicago Board of Trade being fully negotiable and transferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.189" offset="10736744">There is no essential difference in the trading of stock and bonds and in the trading of futures contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.651" offset="10774570">Now, this Court in the case of S. E. C. against Joiner Corporation, reported at 320 U.S.344, looked particularly at the fact that the documents there before the Court which incidentally were leases of particular pieces of real estate that mineral leases are the particular pieces of real estate, whether the documents were widely offered or dealt in on their terms or in a course of dealing which established their character as securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.956" offset="10939768">Now, we contend here that the -- that the course of dealing the characteristics of the -- of a corn futures do establish them as security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.472" offset="10981878">At this point I would like to look at the purpose of the statute which was in the words of the Committee Reports of both Houses of Congress to prevent evasion, that's what they said, of taxes by taking of losses where the economic position of the taxpayer was not altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.022" offset="11064007">Now, the -- the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit having in mind this -- this purpose of Congress adopted the definition in Webster's New International Dictionary of securities as applicable in the case of commodity futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.372" offset="11145404">This definition is that a security is an evidence of debt or a property as a bond, stock, certificate or other instrument, etc., a document giving the right to demand and receive property not in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.227" offset="11208829">That Court then held that when the taxpayer had the Court -- the cottonseed oil future yet in the words of the Court, it had no more than a document giving it the right to demand and receive property not in its possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.122" offset="11264418">This, said the Court, is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.001" offset="11275912">He went on to say that unless commodity futures losses are within the statute, the bearing under the statute has weakened pointing out that commodity dealings are almost as extensive as dealings in stocks and bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.507" offset="11346024">The Government argues first that securities mean corporate securities because in most of the definitions in the Internal Revenue Code, the subject matter is only corporate securities.We submit that this argument has no weight in view of the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.467" offset="11421780">It's this Court to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.257" offset="11432960">The Government also argues that the ordinary dictionary definition is an unusual meaning to give the word securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.627" offset="11462426">It seems to me, Your Honors, that the statement of this proposition has its own answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.893" offset="11483533">At this point, I would like to call the attention of the Court to the fact that the statute is designed to protect the revenue and if the Government's position is sustained, it will mean a loss of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.566" offset="11542256">The real question was, was it Congress' intention to close the loophole only partly as to corporate stocks and bonds or did it mean to close the loophole entirely as to all securities regularly traded including commodity futures?</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.325" offset="11609234">We think the answer is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.565" offset="11622191">The only other issue involved under Section 118 is whether a futures contract of one maturity is substantially identical to a succeeding maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.838" offset="11667331">The wording of the contracts is identical which appear at the record 90.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.054" offset="11692199">Normally, the only difference in -- in price between a future of one maturity and the next succeeding maturity is the cost to a storage of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.905" offset="11743608">It appears in the record at page 51 and this is around one-and-a-half cents of bushel a month for the intervening months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.539" offset="11778090">This is not really an economic difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.217" offset="11800764">If -- if the buyer took delivery on his future of one maturity and held the product until the next maturity, assuming that's when he was going to use it, he would have that storage expense so that his economic position on one maturity is really, we say, substantially identical to his position on a -- on the next succeeding maturity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.333" offset="12385280">As a matter of fact, those prices, the Government has set them forth at page 50 of its brief and I think that makes it clear that economically there's not -- not any difference to speak of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.078" offset="12452258">There is just one other point -- there is just one other point in the Government's brief that I would -- I would like to discuss and that is where the Government attempts to identify wash sales under the Commodity Exchange Act with wash sales under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.118" offset="12520385">Now, wash sale is known for trade under the Commodity Exchange Act, it's a fictitious sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.582" offset="12538253">For instance, in the case where a person sells through one broker and buys from himself through another broker for the purpose of establishing a published quotation as he may use to a regular market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.851" offset="12599380">Of course, there's no sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.666" offset="12606589">The sale is fictitious and that's a crime under -- under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.764" offset="12626965">The wash sale under the Internal Revenue Code is entirely a different sales, a real sales to a third person that the -- the seller repurchases and so he retains his economic possession, his loss is an actual realized loss that it's merely a paper loss because he has the property he always had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.594" offset="12718289">On the other hand, the gains on wash sales of the Internal Revenue Code are real gains and are both recognized in tax and the Valley Waste Mills case and Harriss against Commissioner referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.963" offset="12775758">It is -- it is submitted at the Government's semantics on the identity of these two types of wash sales is not a valid point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.626" offset="12830407">In closing, I want to say that the Court of Appeals and the Tax Court and the Government in its brief cite the Valley Waste Mills case and the Harriss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.860" offset="12875337">Now, the Government -- the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit merely refers to them and the Government's brief seems to imply that these cases were decided under Section 112 (b) (1) relating to exchange as a property used in trade or business and that there was some holding about whether they were property of a like kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.207" offset="12952764">Now, we have studied these cases as -- there's no reference to Section 112 (b) (1), maybe one of them in the Valley Waste Mills case, the Court merely said that the exchange has been recognized under Section 112 (a) which says that (Inaudible) are recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.509" offset="13021936">There is a discussion at 112 (b) (1) where in the Trenton Cotton Oil case where the Court held that -- that the gains were -- were recognized because it was a sale and a purchase and not an exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.845" offset="13143353">As Mr. Kramer has said there are two questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.088" offset="13160281">First is whether or not certain transactions of the petitioner in commodity futures should be considered as capital gains or income -- or losses or ordinary income or losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.594" offset="13226318">And the second question is one which is reached only if the Court decides the first question adversely to the Government and that is the point just covered by Mr. McCain as to whether or not the transactions in question were subject to the wash sales provisions of Section 118 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.209" offset="13320777">Now, Mr. Kramer has given you the factual background in this matter and I think there is not too much dispute as to the basic facts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.751" offset="13374903">He has, however, hurried over somewhat the manner in which this case arises and because we think the setting is particularly important in this case to an understanding of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.314" offset="13445224">I would to review briefly the -- the manner in which the question arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.367" offset="13465391">In significant part, what we are trying to determine here is what were the average annual earnings of this taxpayer during the so-called base period of 1936 to 1939 which was taken by Congress as a period of normal earnings for use in the application of the excess profits tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.417" offset="13573642">Now, the excess profits tax laws, I did not, as Your Honors know, apply to all earnings of a company during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.087" offset="13616274">The purpose of that Act was to capture those profits which were in excess of normal or average annual earnings during a normal peacetime period which was -- which purpose is 1936 to 1939 was taken as normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.742" offset="13694955">And in excluding or in arriving at that definition of average annual earnings, Congress was seeking to limit the -- or to stabilize the earnings that the normal operating profit of a corporation and to exclude from that concept all things which were abnormal and non-recurrent or which were not related to their ordinary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.378" offset="13809476">And thus, as a part of the concept, it excluded capital gains and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.435" offset="13841659">Now, in this particular case, the taxpayer is interested in having this particular transactions treated as capital gains or losses because for that -- for that reason they would be excluded from the computation of its credit under the excess profits tax laws, and hence, less of their income in the wartime period would be subject to excess profits taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.897" offset="13987527">In other words, if these were not ordinary losses to be deducted from ordinary income of the taxpayer during the base period, the taxpayer's base period net income is that much higher and therefore it's credit when it comes into the wartime excess profits tax period is substantially greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.890" offset="14083553">But we think that selling is important because we believe that Congress in enacting the excess profits tax law was seeking to exclude as a credit or was seeking to allow as a credit base only those earnings which were normal, regular operating profit of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.848" offset="14187311">And therefore, when it chose to eliminate capital gains and losses from the computation of average annual earnings, it were doing so in the belief that what it was excluding was not a normal part of the business activity of the particular taxpayer and therefore, it shouldn't be charged with -- with such items as included in their credit in computing the excess profits tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Rice</label>
            <text syncTime="3595.314" offset="14381244">It's -- it's a suggestion, Your Honor, that -- that Congress thought of capital gains and losses in the manner in which we contend the statute could be construed as relating primarily to investment properties and not something which is an integral part of the manufacturing process, the integral part of operating profit recurring from day-to-day and from year-to-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.927" offset="14507677">It is really a -- our argument here is really a double barrel proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.368" offset="14529411">In other words, we would contend for the construction of Section 117 along the lines that we do even if there were no question of excess profits tax law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.110" offset="14576431">But as it happens, there is a question of excess profits tax law involved and we believe that Congress when it took into that law or when it excluded under that law capital gains and losses from the determination of average annual income, it was thinking of capital gains and losses just as we are thinking of them for purposes of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.602" offset="14702341">Now, as Your Honors know, the outset of our income tax laws, the capital gains were treated as ordinary income, capital gains and losses were treated as ordinary income or losses in contradistinction to the British system under which they were not treated as income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.248" offset="14812891">And that created a great deal of dissatisfaction in this country because it was felt that capital gains were not the same as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.676" offset="14858658">They represented profit which had been appreciated over a number -- period of years and that the taxation of capital gains and ordinary income rates was a deterrent to the conversion of -- of capital assets into income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.790" offset="14943086">And so in 1921, the first capital gains law was enacted which was a sort of a compromise between the previous American concept of them and the British concept and that they were treated as a class apart, as -- as taxable but not as taxable as the same as ordinary income and special rates were applicable to gains which fell in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.212" offset="15088744">The definition of capital assets contained in that law is, as our brief points out, rather unique and that it is specific only in what is excluded from the statute and not as to what is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.234" offset="15176934">It specifically excludes stock in trade, inventory, property on hand primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary force of trade or business and depreciable property used in the trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.379" offset="15241509">Now, it was early recognized by this Court and by others that this definition of capital assets and the granting of capital gain or a preferential capital gain treatment was to be given a strict construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.613" offset="15330429">This Court had the question before it in 20 or more years ago when Burnet against Harmel, which the question was as to the status of royalties and bonuses received in the sale of oil leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.728" offset="15402841">And there it was contended that the oil leases were property and that they didn't fall within any of the four exceptions here and that the income received by the lessor must constitute capital gain to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.661" offset="15462609">And this Court in reviewing the history of the capital gains taxation found that it wasn't the sort of thing that Congress had in mind when they were granting this preferential treatment, that it was not the sort of hardship that Congress was seeking to avoid when they enacted the capital gains law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.081" offset="15564278">There wasn't in that case any particular transaction such as you have in the normal sale, any one isolated transactions such as you have in a normal sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.239" offset="15616940">And the -- though the title to the gas or oil might have passed as result of the lease, it was but an incident of the manufacturing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.618" offset="15658423">And consequently, although the -- a literal application of the statute might have produced a favorable result for the taxpayer, this Court held that -- to hold that the taxpayer was entitled to capital gains treatment would defeat, rather than further, the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.161" offset="15752568">And so in subsequent decisions, both here and in the courts below, there have been numerous cases in which superficially the transaction in question appeared to qualify for capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.386" offset="15817456">But the Court involved found that it wasn't the sort of thing that Congress had in mind and it didn't represent an appreciation of profit over substantial period of years and that to permit that kind of preferential treatment, it would not be in accord with the -- with the spirit of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.016" offset="15912020">We've had it in the case of -- of payments as a part of a lump sum condemnation award which represented compensation for the delay in the -- in the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.098" offset="15964369">You had it in the case -- in this Court in the case of lump sums paid in the cancellation of a lease and we have had it in court -- in the courts below in connection with the sale of rights to receive a legal fee for past due services or sale of bond interest overdue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.521" offset="16042005">And then in a variety of other circumstances, we have had situations which if you gave the statute a literal application to follow the language with federal fidelity, you would've arrived at a result in favor of the capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.078" offset="16128209">And then again, we have another series of cases in the Circuit Courts in which the Courts have held that the profits involved were directly related to the manufacturing or -- or business operations of the taxpayer in such a way that Congress couldn't be deemed to have intended that they should receive the preferential treatment granted to capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.444" offset="16257776">Only recently in the Second Circuit, in the Bagley &amp; Sewall case, the taxpayer under a contract for the Government of Finland for the manufacture of paper equipment was required to purchase a very large amount of government bonds, place them in escrow for the performance of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.539" offset="16350145">It didn't have any bonds on hand and it had to borrow the money with which to buy the bonds and when the contract was performed satisfactorily and the bonds could be released from escrow where they were sold at a loss, which the taxpayer claimed it was an ordinary loss being intimately connected with its business operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.451" offset="16449724">And in that case, the Second Circuit held that the property in question couldn't be divorced from its background or from the nature of the contract pursuant to which it was bought and that the reason for which it was bought was a business reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.493" offset="16529972">And that therefore, it was not the sort of thing that Congress had in mind in -- in setting up the -- a favored capital gains treatment, so the ordinary loss was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.457" offset="16589740">We've had the same sort of thing in the liquor stock cases where to obtain purchase of liquor in favorable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.716" offset="16634776">Taxpayers have purchased the stock from companies so that they could get the rights to buy the liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.999" offset="16659958">And thereafter, sold the stock at a loss and has been allowed ordinary losses because again, the -- the purchase of the loss was a part of their normal recurring day-to-day business activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.894" offset="16727562">And so again, we have had it in the case of the purchase of the stock of a company in order to get out of an unfavorable contract which the taxpayer -- the purchaser-taxpayer have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.116" offset="16780434">And there again, it was held that the purpose of the transaction was so intimately connected with the normal business with the operating activity of the purchaser that should be treated as an ordinary loss and not a capital loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="4229.763" offset="16918988">Well, no, I don't think it makes any difference to the theory of our case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.460" offset="16941767">So with that background seeing as we do that the -- the capital gains statute is not to be applied literally and -- and so to speak in vacuo without regard to the circumstances of the particular case, we turn to the hedging exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.860" offset="17043435">Now, the hedging exception as Mr. Kramer or the hedging question as Mr. Kramer pointed out, it didn't become significant in the earlier revenue acts because under those acts, the capital asset had to be one which was held for two years or more or as by definition, the commodity futures are held for a substantially lesser period than that, less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.124" offset="17164434">But in 1934, when that two-year limitation was taken off the statute, the question did become important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.708" offset="17206753">And in 1936, the Treasury Department issued its General Counsel's Memorandum which Mr. Kramer referred to and which is the -- the background -- furnishes the background for most of the litigation as followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.354" offset="17301316">And in that General Counsel's Memorandum, the Treasury said as follows, "Such hedges which eliminates speculative risks due to fluctuations in the market price of cotton and therefore tend to assure ordinary operating profits are common trade practices and are generally regarded as a form of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.648" offset="17390550">The only kind available as protection against such risks necessary to conservative business operation, where future contracts are entered into only to ensure against the above mentioned risks inherent from the taxpayers business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.794" offset="17455125">The hedging operations should be recognized as a legitimate form of business insurance, as such, the cost thereof which includes losses sustained therein is an ordinary and necessary expense deductible under Section 23 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1934 and corresponding provisions of prior revenue acts."</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.027" offset="17556062">Well, that General Counsel's Memorandum laid down the general principle that those hedges which were a form of price protection and -- or a form of price insurance were to be regarded as regular business practices of the taxpayer and not to qualify for capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.467" offset="17673822">Now, this rule which was laid down in the General Counsel's Memorandum has been on the books ever since 1936, nearly 20 years and never, as far as I know prior to this case, has it been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.258" offset="17748950">Now, there have been -- there has been litigation in the lower courts involving the application of the principle and in particular cases, it was contended that the transactions involved there either were or weren't price insurance and that they were or weren't speculation or exchange of risks or something other than hedging.</text>

            <text syncTime="4706.367" offset="18825404">Now, as I said there has been litigation in the courts as to the application of the rule but never until now has this rule itself had been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.563" offset="18862184">And referring to the canon of construction which I just recited, namely, that where a settled administrative practice is then inherent to for many years and Congress has as it has here reenacted the Internal Revenue Code several times during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.581" offset="18962286">The courts will recognize that as indicative of the congressional will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.965" offset="18987781">Now, we have more than that in this particular case because in 1954, in the new Internal Revenue Code, when Congress was amending the provisions in regard to short sales of property, it -- it provided that gain or loss in the short sale of property other than a hedging transaction in commodity futures is to be treated as a gain or loss from a sale of a capital asset to the extent that the property including a commodity future used to close the short sale constitutes a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Rice</label>
            <text syncTime="4788.996" offset="19155905">That's 1233 (a) of the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.075" offset="19172206">In the Committee Report with respect to that Section, it was said that under existing law of bona fide hedging transactions do not result from capital gains or losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.824" offset="19219226">This result is based upon case law and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.486" offset="19233855">To continue this result hedging transactions in commodity futures have been specifically excepted from the operation of this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.844" offset="19271367">So there we have a recognition, after some 20 years of experience, 20 years that the problem existed, by Congress that that had been the law all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.391" offset="19321522">In other words, that short sales do not -- that hedging transactions do not result from capital gains and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.623" offset="19390485">Now, on this particular case, the petitioner which was one of the largest consumers of corn, if not, the largest in the United States had, as the record shows, a twin purpose in -- in the purchase of corn futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.137" offset="19468539">They wanted to -- it had a limited as Mr. Kramer pointed out, a limited storage capacity something like three-week supply and it wanted to assure itself without the expense of additional storage facilities which they -- the petitioner's officials testified would be very expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.552" offset="19558191">It wanted to assure itself of a satisfactory supply of corn to meet its requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.085" offset="19592255">And at the same time, it wanted to guard against rises in the price of corn when it came to honor it's -- or to carry out its contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.326" offset="19637290">Now, its contracts were entered into on either the basis of the contract price or the market price, the lower of those two would prevail, so that the taxpayer in this particular case was seeking by the purchase of these commodity futures to protect itself against increases in the price of -- of the raw corn which might occur during the time that it was necessary to manufacture the product and deliver it to the customer to whom it had a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.467" offset="19813773">Now, we have in this case -- we do not have, well, the so-called true hedge and that the -- there is not protection against both a rise and a fall in -- in the price of corn, the protection only against the rise in the price of a corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.707" offset="19898828">But that was a result of the taxpayers of the type of contract for which it entered into with its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.586" offset="19930279">In other words, those in which they -- the customer could have the benefit of either the market price or the contract price at the date of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.204" offset="19972807">So that in effecting this form of price insurance, it is true that the taxpayer did not have complete insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.195" offset="20012722">It didn't have the -- what is sometimes, I think perhaps unfortunately referred to as the true hedge which would be a hedge against either a rise or a fall in the price of the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.000" offset="20067997">But the true -- the term true hedge is we think somewhat misleading, it connotes as it's opposite the false hedge or some hedge which other than a partial or incomplete one such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.806" offset="20159216">The -- a more correct terminology I think would be a -- a complete hedge in which the hedge guarded against a rise or a fall in the price of -- of goods or a partial or incomplete hedge such as we have here where the protection was only against the rise in the price of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.180" offset="20264647">But it is our position, nevertheless, that -- that it doesn't make any difference whether the hedge is complete or partial as long -- as long as it forms -- as long as it performs the function of price insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.593" offset="20330371">Now, the taxpayer here got all the protection that it was able to get under the formal contract which it utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.944" offset="20363703">It's true that it didn't get -- it didn't get the protection of a complete hedge but that was impossible under the nature of its contract, so that to say that it is not a hedge merely because it did not guard against any -- every possible loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.942" offset="20443742">It would be like saying that insurance, which guarded against only the risks of -- of fire and tornado and not against hurricane was not insurance because it was not complete insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.847" offset="20515318">And so here, the -- the hedge guarded against or was partial insurance and we think that was -- that that is enough to bring it within the hedging exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.877" offset="20595461">In a case of this magnitude where the taxpayer was dealing in such vast quantities of corn, it's impossible of course to match item per item to prove that for every purchase of a commodity future, the taxpayer had a corresponding commitment for a forward sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.192" offset="20704758">But when you compare the orders which the taxpayer had and the futures which it bought, we submit that there is a broad correspondence between its orders and futures particularly for the years 1940 and 1942 which are the tax years here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.960" offset="20835788">And in any event, the testimony of the court below or in the court below was -- by the taxpayer's own officers was to the effect that we need the corn that we have bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.075" offset="20888242">And in -- and in the proceeding under the -- before the Department of Agriculture involving the Commodity Exchange Act, it stated that the futures it bought represented only corn which was expected to use within a relatively short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.807" offset="20987193">In other words, it forecast what its business would be and bought futures of corn accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.514" offset="21030034">The taxpayers has put considerable emphasis on the fact that its customers had the right to cancel contracts if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.858" offset="21083429">And to us that feature is of no great significance here because that right of cancellation was in the opposite party and if it were to the other party's advantage, the price of corn should rise, it would be to the other party's advantage to exercise their -- to hold the taxpayer to its contract so that we don't -- do not see that that particular feature has any significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.821" offset="21235252">In the -- it is our position that essentially this is a factual question which in this case has been resolved against the taxpayer by concurrent findings of the two courts below in which under the principles laid down by this Court will be accepted as final here except in the case of showing of exceptional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.850" offset="21383314">Now, there are various definitions of the term hedging but one thing is basic to it and that is that in some way it guards against -- gives protection against price fluctuations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.543" offset="21466070">Accepting that general principle, you can find variations which range from the -- from the broad definition in the New York Commodity Exchange market in which it is indicated clearly that commodity futures purchased in anticipation of sales, believed regarded as hedging, to a narrow and restricted definition under the Commodity Exchange Act where the purpose being to guard against unnecessary fluctuations in the price of commodities, hedging is very, very strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.358" offset="21653420">For purposes of the tax laws, bearing in mind what Congress had intended with respect to the capital -- favored capital gains treatment and bearing in mind the particular background of this case and which we're trying to determine what earnings would be normal to this taxpayer, we think that the hedging exception should be given a broad and wide definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.589" offset="21770344">In other words, it should not be restricted as in the manner of the Commodity Exchange Act but should be considered to cover all transactions in which there is some form of insurance prices, whether it be complete or whether it should be partial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.574" offset="21846204">A taxpayer in this proceeding is in a particularly awkward position for the reason that in this Court, it is contending that its transactions are those of a -- the so-called independent capitalist, whatever that maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.576" offset="21934289">And at the same time in the proceeding before the Department of Agriculture, it is contending that the -- that it is engaging in hedging transactions so that -- while here it contends that it is not hedging and that its transactions were those of an independent capitalist in the agriculture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.650" offset="22074514">It is contending that it didn't buy futures in excess of what it estimated its needs would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.551" offset="22110145">They have the technique to forecast what its needs would be and that purchases of futures of that kind were hedges against possible price increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.990" offset="22207948">So in -- in conclusion of this point, it is our position that this case turns not on any precise definition of hedging but on the meaning of -- of the capital gains transactions and the tax laws, particularly with the background of the excess profits tax laws which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.147" offset="22304496">We believe that these -- that these transactions were an integral part of the normal day-to-day business of the taxpayer that they form part of their operating profits and losses that they would not be considered among the class of property which Congress would intend to exclude from the definition of capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.322" offset="22425287">And that when the Congress enacted the excess profits tax law and excluded capital assets from the definition or from the computation of average annual earnings, it had no idea that it was excluding computation of losses of this sort from the average annual earnings of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.454" offset="22529776">Now, the second question involved in this case is whether or not -- and this question is reached only if the first question is decided adversely to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.515" offset="22582021">The second question is whether or not the -- the transactions here in question fall within Section 118 of the Code relating to the wash sales provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.117" offset="22636460">And the first question there is whether or not these commodity futures constitute stock or securities within the meaning of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.548" offset="22690168">And first of all, we point out that in the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has referred to stock or securities a half a dozen times in various contexts throughout the statute and in none of those instances were it has used the terms stock and securities or securities alone as it included commodity futures within the definition of the term commodity -- within the definition of the term securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.348" offset="22825378">On the other hand and then several instances within the Code and the citations to these sections are in the briefs, it has specifically referred to commodity futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.474" offset="22885878">For example, in the definition of personal holding company income and foreign personal holding company income, it refers to stock and securities in -- as one type of personal holding company income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.305" offset="22945123">And then it refers to income from transactions in commodity futures as another type of personal holding company income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.065" offset="22976157">So that the history of the Code shows that Congress when it has intended to include commodity futures, it has specifically referred to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.186" offset="23040731">It has not included them in its definitions of stock and securities where it used elsewhere within the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.588" offset="23074273">We find the same thing is true in the -- in the trade practice in the Chicago Board of Trade, the rules and regulations also distinguished between stock and securities on the one hand and commodity transactions on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.404" offset="23153580">There are differences as to commissions and brokerage fees and the places in the pit where the transactions must take place and so forth.All of which we think tends to emphasize that in using the word stock -- word stock or securities, Congress did not intend to include the commodity futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.713" offset="23262772">The Committee Reports under Section 118 are completely silent as to any intention to cover commodity futures and the words throughout those reports, the word stock and securities are used interchangeably so that we think that it's clear that what Congress had in mind was the ordinary shares of stock and notes, bonds, the ventures and other evidences of indebtedness and not commodity futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.978" offset="23423896">In addition to those matters of statutory construction, we think that commodity futures of such a nature that they do not -- lend themselves to evil which Congress was intending to prevent in Section 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.556" offset="23502158">They are held for a short duration, 11 months or less whereas with your ordinary stocks and securities, it's possible to build up a portfolio of gains over a substantial period of time and then Section 118 more than in existence to make some sales at a loss, buy back the securities in short time and thereby establish a fictitious loss which could be used to offset against the gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.622" offset="23630472">The commodity futures transaction are of a different nature because it's a recurring process with the futures, a very short duration in the process or working forward in the market and via selling futures and buying new ones, delivery at a later date to replace the ones sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.952" offset="23727752">Furthermore, as the record indicates below, it would be a costly operation to -- to engage in transactions of this nature solely for the purpose of establishing tax law -- tax losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.291" offset="23809149">And then again if Section 118 applied in this situation where the hedgers are working forward continually in the market selling and buying and buying and selling, it would mean in many situations that the computation of any gain or loss would be postponed indefinitely, perhaps several years as -- as the new commodity futures were purchased to replace those sold and this is contrary to the general principles of tax accounting that transactions are to be accounted for in the year in which they took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.875" offset="24011442">In view of the statutory construction and these practical principals which illustrate that the reasons were not present in the case of commodity futures, which were present in the case of stocks and securities, we believe that Congress did not intend to include commodity futures within the meaning of the term stock -- stock and securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.693" offset="24126694">There is another reason, a separate and independent reason why commodity futures are not subject to the provisions of Section 118 and that is that the commodity futures -- that the purchase of another commodity future is not substantially identical to the one which it replaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.036" offset="24236095">You have differences as to seller, as to price, as to delivery date and -- and these commodity futures, the seller has the right with a certain price adjustment to make a delivery of a different grade commodity so that the commodity future may result in the delivery of even a different grade than that contemplated in the future just sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.883" offset="24359497">The delivery date, of course, the difference in the delivery date is the most important feature indicating that they are not substantially identical because delivery dates are the keystone of the futures transaction, the most important, probably the most important feature of them and the differences in those dates we think alone may prevent them -- prevent a new one from being substantially identical to the one sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.064" offset="24508186">Congress has recognized this when in the Revenue Act of 1950 in Section 211 in determining the holding period of short sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.049" offset="24572134">It specifically provided that a commodity future requiring delivery in one calendar month shall not be considered as property -- property substantially identical to another commodity future requiring delivery in a different calendar month.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.382" offset="24641515">So there we have the congressional recognition that one -- that a commodity future requiring delivery in -- in a different month is not substantially identical with the commodity future sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="6191.387" offset="24765544">Furthermore, as our brief indicates, there are important price differentials or have been in the commodity markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.873" offset="24807445">We give an illustration of that at page 50 of our brief, which refute the taxpayer contention that there is only a small economic difference in the value of the different maturities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.143" offset="24892500">And finally under -- in connection with this point, the -- we call attention to the fact that the Commodity Exchange Act itself prevents the -- prevents or prohibits wash or fictitious sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6236.993" offset="24947879">And while the petitioner has made some attempt to indicate that the sales under the tax laws is referred to as wash sales are real sales whereas the -- those under the Commodity Exchange Act are fictitious sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.957" offset="25015798">Actually, the reason that the loss is disallowed under the tax laws is because there is no economic change.There is no -- no real sale under -- under those laws either.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.886" offset="25079536">And we submit that it is not to be assumed that the taxpayer was conducting transactions here in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.300" offset="25141185">In connection with the taxpayer's chart or graph, which it has in its brief and is blown up as an exhibit here, we would like to call attention to our own chart appearing at the -- as an appendix to our brief in which -- which we believe gives a more accurate picture of the situation as it existed during the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.888" offset="25263543">The taxpayer's chart is pyramided in one category upon another whereas ours has leveled them out and we think that from this chart -- chart number one of ours, it is possible to gain a more accurate picture of the situation as it existed in the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.710" offset="25358838">We also have added a chart two showing a comparison between futures owned and the carry over in the terminal market, which was the amount of corn which was available for -- for commercial consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.839" offset="25431353">In other words, what the -- the amount of corn which the taxpayer was able to buy at any particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6373.277" offset="25493107">So in summary of our position here with respect to the -- to the first point, we contend that the transactions in question fall within the hedging exception under the Internal Revenue Code, then first of all that the capital asset statute is not to be read as the taxpayer would have us do with a literal exactness and without regard to the facts of the particular circumstance or without regard to the fact that Congress intended to cover a particular type of hardship in enacting this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6458.689" offset="25834684">Well, I -- I refer to a hedging exception as one established by administrative construction and by judicial precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.137" offset="25872509">We contend that there is in this case -- are in this case the elements of a hedge of -- of price protection against price increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6478.796" offset="25915141">But that was the only form of protection which under the particular type of contract in which the taxpayer engaged, but the only type of protection which was available to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.754" offset="25978984">Thereby, achieved a form of partial insurance which comes within the hedging exception and that this was so integrated to its business form, so normal a part of its business that it should be held to be an exception to the capital gains statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.632" offset="26074488">And on the second point, we contend both that the commodity futures were not stock and -- or securities within the meaning of the statute and that they were not -- those purchased were not substantially identical to those sold and therefore do not come within the wash sales of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6543.801" offset="26175112">I believe I have six minutes to reply, the marshal has so informed me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.981" offset="26199876">I waited with some impatience, I will admit, to find out whether the respondent at last was going to utter the missing phrase which the courts below had never paid any attention to which has appeared in every statute since 1921 and that is the definition of capital assets includes all assets whether or not connected with taxpayers trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.142" offset="26296529">The respondent has -- the Court will see that explained what that phrase means and I submit that it means just what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.808" offset="26335190">Number two, respondent -- I would like to turn this proceeding into a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.219" offset="26368836">Both courts below have held that we were not engaged in true hedging operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.454" offset="26389734">Other courts have held that that is the test.Is this a true hedge or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="6603.926" offset="26415647">If it is not a true hedge, then as a matter of law, you must have capital treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.491" offset="26437904">Otherwise, you have ordinary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.070" offset="26448248">So it is not a question of fact, it is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.664" offset="26466638">Number three, I produced this chart blown up in this fashion for one purpose, to show that there is no correlation between our orders and our futures position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.928" offset="26527660">On 7141, when our orders were at their highest, we had the smallest future position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.407" offset="26561620">At 7138, when our orders were at their lowest point, we had our largest futures position accumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.442" offset="26597669">In fact, there we had five -- we had almost 10 billion -- 10 million bushels of futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.327" offset="26629224">All our futures position was -- was a calculated risk that we were going to have a -- that we were going to have a rise in the corn market rather than a fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.954" offset="26687739">All we did is shift the risk from a risk that corn would rise to a risk that corn might go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.857" offset="26727340">In Commissioner versus Farmers &amp; Ginners Cotton Oil Company, Fifth Circuit 1941, reported at 120 F.2d 722, the Court said that there was no hedge when a taxpayer who manufactured crude cottonseed oil which it sold for refined cottonseed futures, it thereby merely shifted the risk, the Court said, that refine might go down in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.445" offset="26829740">All we did by establishing our futures position here to take the risk that the price of corn would go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.714" offset="26866834">That has been denominated as partial insurance but it is not insurance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.629" offset="26886478">It's the taking of a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.276" offset="26897032">If I buy real estate, I shift the risk from the risk that that real estate might go up in price to the risk that it might go down in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.830" offset="26935275">That is not insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.171" offset="26940604">It is merely the taking of a position.</text>

            <text syncTime="6738.231" offset="26952829">What do you take the position for?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay O. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="6744.710" offset="26978743">We are entitled to take a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.819" offset="26991177">We contend there is a purpose if we wish to we can get the delivery of raw corn by buying futures and where we have done so, we have correctly reported it as part of our inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.998" offset="27043944">But there's no contention here and the court below has held that these futures were not part of our inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.448" offset="27065783">The Tax Court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.824" offset="27079262">Furthermore, I would like to point out there's an obvious inaccuracy in that Committee Report which was read to the Court appearing at page 29 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.162" offset="27120640">We have all admitted the Section 730 -- that General Counsel's Memorandum 17322 never became part of regulations and yet the Committee Report said this result is based on case law and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.619" offset="27178423">Actually, the only regulation here which has any force or effect is the regulation which states all assets are capital assets unless specifically excluded and that has appeared in every regulation since 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.790" offset="27243102">It has had repeated reenactment and judicial sanction arising therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.079" offset="27272255">With respect to the 118 point, the fact that Congress in 1951, I believe, changed the law and required -- and stated that the holding period would not include where there had been a shift in -- in futures positions from one future to another -- from one maturity to another I should I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.250" offset="27364937">It indicates very clearly to me that that was not the law before that time and therefore cannot be taken as indicative of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.399" offset="27401509">I believe that that covers all of the points which we wish to -- to make except to say in summary that what the respondent wants this Court to do is to disregard specific language in the statute, to disregard repeated enactment of that statute, to disregard his own regulations and to disregard the repeated statement of those regulations year after year, code after code and that is the position the respondent -- the petitioner respectfully submits is incorrect.</text>
