            <label>Mr. Robert N. Gorman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.811" offset="107207">This matter is before the Court on certiorari -- certiorari from the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.906" offset="139598">It involves questions of full faith and credit and due process of law in reference to a divorce actions in both Florida and Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.484" offset="189858">Briefly, the question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.005" offset="203964">Armstrong, the petitioner was granted a divorce in Florida where both he and his wife had lived for 22 years, where they had a matrimonial domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.012" offset="264046">She had fled to Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.399" offset="277525">The Florida Court denied her alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.787" offset="295079">Subsequently, after this decree was entered, she filed a suit in Ohio for divorce and alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.210" offset="332800">The Ohio court gave full faith and credit to the divorce, but awarded her alimony of 1250 shares of General Motors Stock approximately worth, today, $170,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.788" offset="395076">Now, it is our contention, in this case, that where the matrimonial domicile, and the doctrine has not been entirely abandoned, even though it has been whittled away and where she was served under a statute in Florida, reasonably calculated to give her notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.595" offset="498312">And that she actually did receive notice, and deliberately refused to appear in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.607" offset="538331">We say that the Ohio court should have given entire full faith and credit to the entire decree, and not applied the doctrine of divisible divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.431" offset="581695">These facts supported and anything we had in (Inaudible) or in other case, because in those cases and all, the husband would go to another State and there obtained a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.871" offset="647419">Then the wife would either -- they held the support order which survived or she'd come back later.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.256" offset="676989">These facts are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.179" offset="684617">Here, the husband remains in the matrimonial domicile and the wife flees to another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.454" offset="721816">If such a doctrine is to be upheld, then it seems to me that forum-shopping is a premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.904" offset="755566">That the husband could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.678" offset="770612">Take for example here and we had an actual case on this (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="199.465" offset="797780">He goes to Ohio and takes all his securities with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.219" offset="812826">The wife cannot get any alimony because she can't get personal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.040" offset="832157">We maintain that if that's the matrimonial domicile, the wife ought to their sufficient dominant interest in the matrimonial domicile and when where service is given that that ought to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.145" offset="888477">Now, this matter's never been before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.693" offset="898717">You can go back to way 226 United States, in the Thompson case, and Justice Pitney in that case, which has never been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.021" offset="939990">As a matter of fact, it was distinguished in the Estin case and if I would assume it's still the law, that it's going to be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.963" offset="971755">But we're not like right -- relying alone on the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.498" offset="985966">There may be some modification in that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.106" offset="1000385">Now, I think briefly with that, as to the question, I should give you the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.957" offset="1027762">Armstrong, the petitioner and his wife were married in Cincinnati Ohio on June 18th, 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.347" offset="1061303">Shortly after that, they went to Florida and except for a short period of time spent in the Isle of Pines, they lived in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.005" offset="1108010">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.707" offset="1114802">You can read both her testimony on page 62, and his testimony on page 119.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.360" offset="1149388">They quoted there, they owned their home there, they paid their taxes there and they claimed there exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.557" offset="1178227">Now, they had some squabbles in the latter part of 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.613" offset="1202364">And they were adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.012" offset="1211977">They owned real estate there and the principal stock although, there was others which Armstrong had at that time 2250 shares of General Motors Stock in his own name, on which he paid taxes in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.690" offset="1274671">In October of 1950, Mrs. Armstrong purloined those unendorsed certificates and went to Ohio with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.062" offset="1324199">The record shows that she did not immediately intend to make that her domicile.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.882" offset="8591464">The Slapp case in Ohio, 142 Ohio State is identical with Estin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.707" offset="8610795">The husband goes out to Nevada, that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.618" offset="8622393">There's an older case, the Cox case where they migrate between Indiana and Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.494" offset="8641933">I don't know of any particular where the husband was denied the divorce in a foreign jurisdiction and it came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.653" offset="8670563">I think usually the case is where the husband is given a divorce and then they come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.127" offset="8692506">But there again you're going into the question of migration of leaving the matrimonial domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.370" offset="8713404">Now, I'm willing to concede one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.678" offset="8726674">In Thompson versus Thompson, there you have the case where alimony was denied in Virginia and the wife then went into -- that's 226 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.537" offset="8774113">The wife then went into District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.793" offset="8783099">The District Court awarded her alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.215" offset="8792816">This Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.133" offset="8804519">I suppose they could have put the decision on the District of Columbia's ruling at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.925" offset="8831687">That alimony did not survive a divorce, just like in cases in Vermont, and recently being (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.044" offset="8864078">But Justice Pitney did not do it on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.163" offset="8876617">He did it on the basis of full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.766" offset="8891037">Of course, if that was as still -- still the law, this case would have to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.207" offset="8920816">Now, I'm willing to concede that since we have Estin versus Estin, that Thompson versus Thompson there might be some modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.765" offset="8963030">But I take it will present a chaotic situation, if you'd overrule Thompson versus Thompson entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.704" offset="8994795">And that's what you'd have to do here in order to maintain this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.226" offset="9016842">Now, as late as the Estin case you distinguished Thompson versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.702" offset="9034710">But I think on there on the grounds of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.850" offset="9047353">And I see no reason to come on fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.792" offset="9059161">My thing is this, that if being the matrimonial domicile, that Florida had the dominant interest, that she was given reasonable notice, she had actual notice and that satisfied the requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.044" offset="9136170">And once it satisfied the requirements of due process, then full faith and credit have to be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.771" offset="9166994">And I think we've come down to the final question, is whether were going to extend Milliken and Meyer and head first, will pull us, where a man just drives over the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.535" offset="9214119">If that gives a right for personal judgment, it certainly seems to me that the fact that people lived there for 22 years, that that State ought to have as much right as a State where the automobile is driven.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.402" offset="9305548">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.336" offset="9317251">I have been in this litigation much longer than Judge Gorman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.379" offset="9341492">And perhaps, in some of the earlier stages of it I am more familiar than him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.451" offset="9377750">And because of that familiarity, I think it's only fair to say that this litigation whether it be and means two divorce actions are in the two actions that were brought in Ohio to recover securities and other property or, if you please, in the partition action that all of this litigation has been for it has been had for the principal purpose of a trial to the right of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.870" offset="9543471">These divorce sections are more or less are side issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.386" offset="9573460">I ask the Court to remember that Mr. Armstrong is man who is now about 70 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.571" offset="9614211">Mrs. Armstrong is about 63 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.008" offset="9635944">The record bears me out that neither of them were particularly interested in divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.760" offset="9659037">Of course, neither of them have remarried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.933" offset="9679726">But they had gone through life accumulating a substantial estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.439" offset="9725701">And as to the part of that estate, transfers had been made so that the properties were held jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.894" offset="9783484">As to the stocks which the parties had accumulated, no such transfer had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.802" offset="9823190">Go back as early as 1941, it had been contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.955" offset="9847745">And there had been some correspondence with General Motors principal officers about the transfer of General Motors stock to the joint names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.476" offset="9909812">That did not result in such a transfer because of the fact of these parties who, the record show, are inclined to be miserly both of them because of the expense involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.978" offset="9975850">You know that cost them $35 or $40 for transfer stamps in these to have transferred this General Motors stock to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.867" offset="10019422">So, they came down to about the year 1945, where they had gotten along fairly well together and had accumulated an estate that -- back in those days may have amounted to as much as all $200,000 or $250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.130" offset="10120464">Then marital troubles came along, and I became for the first time, acquainted with this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.782" offset="10151079">In the summer of 1948, the two of them, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, were living on their farm in Clermont County Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.671" offset="10214609">And I may -- If I may, to digress there for a moment and say, that all that Judge Gorman had said to you about matrimonial domicile is just his -- his opinion as to where matrimonial domicile was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.726" offset="10282841">These parties had from many years, certainly since they returned from some fruit-growing project that they had jointly engaged in on the Isle of Pines, had lived during the winter months in a residence they had in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.297" offset="10381166">And during the summer months in Ohio, had lived either in Hamilton County Ohio or in Clermont County Ohio where they maintained residences in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.637" offset="10446472">And that had gone on for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.258" offset="10452950">I'll come later to that question of matrimonial domicile but I want to interject that thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.041" offset="10472072">Now, that in 1948, they were living in Hamilton County Ohio, residing there as they had for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.183" offset="10512718">Trouble arose between them and Armstrong hit his wife in the face with a butt-end of a revolver and broke out some of her teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.144" offset="10576562">And she left, and decided that she would not continue to live with him in Ohio or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.002" offset="10615954">Now, I was consulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.962" offset="10631837">And very shortly after that, Mrs. Armstrong took into her possession from safety deposit boxes in joint names and from bank accounts in joint names, substantial amounts of cash and the securities that subsequently became the subject of this litigation, together with some jewelry and some case that was in those boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.431" offset="10749701">Armstrong was notified at once, that she had taken that property into her possession for safekeeping until there could be an agreement between the two of them for a division of their holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.783" offset="10811037">And the record shows that he talked to me and was -- he was advised to get himself a good lawyer and so that I'm with his wife and make that property settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.806" offset="10859207">An attempt was made in employing counsel, not the gentlemen who are here or who appear on these briefs but other counsel in Cincinnati at that time and an effort was made to bring about a property settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.432" offset="10921691">And they were very close to a settlement, satisfactory to both when they decided to go back together again and try it some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.831" offset="10959308">And the lawyers were instructed to stop the litigations and that a reconciliation had been brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.251" offset="10988983">The record shows that Mrs. Armstrong at that time returned to their joint holdings, a very large part of the case that she had taken out of the boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.344" offset="11037362">She paid the attorneys fees on out of the funds that she had taken from these accounts, paid the attorneys fees on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.791" offset="11075082">And they went back to living together, in a winter time in Florida, in the hot months in Florida in the North -- in their properties in the North where they maintained this Northern residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.094" offset="11136313">And time went on and it was again in a fall of 1950 that further difficulty came up between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.265" offset="11181035">Armstrong in the meantime, the record shows, and as a part of his -- his part of that reconciliation, had given to Mrs. Armstrong a written letter or a memorandum in which he acknowledged to her that his behavior in the past have not been what it should have been and in which he promised that he would not again misbehave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.180" offset="11304647">And in which he gave to Mrs. Armstrong the right to retain in her possession these securities and the bonds of the parties, the jewelry that was in controversy until such time as she saw fit to return it to the possession in which it was held on July 1st, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.041" offset="11440065">Well, it -- it was in October of 1950, that Armstrong again gave his wife a beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.092" offset="11476323">This time in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.275" offset="11489071">Gave her such a beating, that she again determined that she could not and would not continue to live with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.913" offset="11531598">And she left this Florida residence and returned, if we want to call it that, to Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.853" offset="11563363">In any event, she came to Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.549" offset="11578096">Now, the securities that are here in controversy and the other property, during that interval of time the record shows remained in Ohio, in her possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.248" offset="13436970">That action was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.121" offset="13448464">Judge Gorman said the only other litigation was a partition action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.516" offset="13469989">This -- this action was pending throughout the divorce pendency in Florida, in which Mr. Armstrong was seeking to recover these securities from Mrs. Armstrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.277" offset="13517009">And if Your Honors will look at page 22 of the record, you will find that when the court upon opening the clerk that morning said, "I see there are two cases here gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.984" offset="13595899">Are they to be tried together?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.758" offset="13610945">And then the parties stipulated that they might be tried together and that the judgment in -- would determine both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.300" offset="13653159">Now, the two cases that he was talking about was this action of Mrs. Armstrong for a divorce and for a division of property, and the action which Mr. Armstrong had brought, seeking to recover from Mrs. Armstrong the property which she held in her possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.701" offset="13742707">And the Court tried both of those cases upon the testimony in this record and under a stipulation that the order which she made would practically determine both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.067" offset="13796206">So, I am back to my original suggestion to Your Honors that this litigation throughout the time it has run, has been one that he has been largely a trial to the right of property with divorce action somewhat incidental.</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.381" offset="14789486">Now, I pointed out in my brief and I don't want to forget it in the time that I have left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.986" offset="14807876">That in Ohio, alimony it doesn't promote the thing that we -- ordinarily talk about a separate maintenance order and like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.542" offset="14850090">Alimony in Ohio includes a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.455" offset="14865763">In fact, our Court said that the right of the Court to make a division of property while it's called alimony actually, is not alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.789" offset="14915082">That it is an exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the Court and that alimony technically starts only where the Court makes some order on the husband to pay alimony out of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.360" offset="14989375">Not the part that's jointly held but out of his share of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.133" offset="15008496">So, when Mrs. Armstrong's petition was filed in Ohio, it was one in which we set up her equitable claim to a division of this property and sought an order against the corporations, requiring them to reissue that stock in such division as the Court equitably found the ownership to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.634" offset="15114449">And that out of Mr. Armstrong's share, after making that equitable division, that Mrs. Armstrong be allowed alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.482" offset="15157917">That was the -- that was our petition and our amended petition and contrary to what Judge Gorman said, that I'm sure he had said it unintentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.731" offset="15198877">Our petition was not one to set aside this Florida decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.116" offset="15220402">There is nothing, no prayer that that decree be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.741" offset="15234926">When I drew that original petition and the amended petition, I had in mind the possibility that this decree of divorce was not entitled to pay any credit because it had been obtained on false and fraudulent testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.876" offset="15327504">And for a time in this case, I presume that thought was subsequently amended because while I --I'm not so sure that -- that we haven't the right to pursue that question, I know that his Honor -- Judge -- Justice Frankfurter has referred to it at time or two in some of the opinions he's written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.346" offset="15425306">The question may be somewhat an open one in this Court whether a decree or a judgment obtained upon fraudulent and false testimony going to the merits rather than to jurisdiction may -- may not be entitled to full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.677" offset="15498658">But I -- I didn't pursue that question beyond the -- the trial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.492" offset="15521959">Perhaps, beyond the Court of Appeals, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.563" offset="15538155">But I did in that petition make one further claim, that I have made in each of the courts below and that I'm making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.154" offset="15588519">And I -- and I think it's one that presents a question that should excite this Court to consideration of it because it -- it is of such importance that I had felt that at no time should I abandon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.873" offset="15655393">And that is, that this decree was not entitled to pay some credit, any part of it because of the manner in which it was heard in Florida before a master commissioner who apparently was in the pay of the attorney for the Florida plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.825" offset="15747239">I want to come to that a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.674" offset="15766674">The case was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.357" offset="15777332">After a time, Mr. Armstrong entered his appearance and filed his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.646" offset="15798544">And in that answer, he pleaded that Florida divorce decree as res judicata of the right of the Ohio court to grant a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.718" offset="15854864">And then, in his answer set up the facts on which he claimed that the Ohio court should not grant alimony to Mrs. Armstrong and should not make any division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.614" offset="15926439">At no place in that answer did he claim that this Florida decree had denied her alimony or that it was res judicata of her right to alimony and through out the trial of this case and until after judgment was entered in this case in the trial court, not one word was said, anywhere, by anybody, that this Florida decree was res judicata as to the right of Mrs. Armstrong to alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.991" offset="16087876">After the Court had heard the testimony, after he'd entered his decree, then a motion for a new trial was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.031" offset="16116088">And then for the first time, Judge Gorman came into the matter and we heard that Thompson versus Thompson raised upon the suggestion made to the Court that Judge Gorman had been -- had been employed to take an appeal of the matter and would depend upon matrimonial domicile that the plaintiff's, that the husband's residence in Florida was the matrimonial domicile and that under Thompson versus Thompson the Court in Ohio could not grant her alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.408" offset="16281600">Now, there was no amendment of the pleading and no plea of res judicata, tendered it that time on and anytime prior to the actual appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.194" offset="16336771">But the matter went into the Court of Appeals or intermediate appellate court upon the theory that full faith and credit was a rule of law that precluded the Ohio court from granting alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.229" offset="16420885">Well, as -- as I understand it, the Full Faith and Credit Clause presents a rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.773" offset="16475011">Res judicata is a defense, may be injected in the case of law and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.028" offset="16504059">But the proof of that defense of res judicata may be made by the production of a record which if in good form, rendered by a court that had jurisdiction, must be given conclusive effect as proof of the defense of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.904" offset="16595592">That wasn't done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.553" offset="16606145">And since it wasn't done in this case and has never been done in this case, I -- I am suggesting in my brief, that there is no question here of full faith and credit preserved in the court below or in the courts below that give to this Court jurisdiction of a properly presented federal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4796.460" offset="19185789">But now, there's another question that's involved, in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.695" offset="19198746">That I set out in my brief and then I think is equally, if not of greater importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.557" offset="19222152">And that is, I know of no authority in Florida law or a court in Florida on the petition of a husband to deny the wife alimony in any case, except if possible that he is where the granting of a decree in and of itself, destroying as it does the marital ties would destroy an incident a marriage to wit, separate maintenance rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.133" offset="19388500">But except as those rights are founded only in the right of support, I know of no case in Florida or anywhere else for that matter that authorizes any court upon the petition of a husband to enter a declaratory judgment, that his wife who hasn't appeared and who hasn't made any claim, is not entitled to alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.593" offset="19502289">I know Judge Gorman will say, “Oh, that's what the Court said, decided in Thompson versus Thompson.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.758" offset="19522978">Well, it isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.491" offset="19529874">That was not decided in Thompson versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.278" offset="19545025">Thomson versus Thompson was not actually a divorce case as we know divorces today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.337" offset="19585254">It was an action for a divorce, (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.419" offset="19613675">It didn't dissolve the marriage ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.024" offset="19632065">Mrs. Thompson who was living over in the District of Columbia and Mr. Thompson who was living in Virginia both before and after that decree remained husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.089" offset="19684310">But under the law of Virginia as at existed at that time Mr. Thompson could go in and seek an order of a court which in effect would deny his right -- his wife the right to sleep in his bed or to eat at his table.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.677" offset="19762678">And that's all he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.042" offset="19768111">He got such an order from the court in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.486" offset="19785874">His wife subsequently, obtained the service of process on, even the District of Columbia and an action which she was a attempting to maintain for separate maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.040" offset="19832059">And the ultimate decision in that case was that she could not maintain that action for a separate maintenance because under the law of Virginia, not what the Court said in that divorce decree but under the law of Virginia, a wife who was at fault could not have alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.320" offset="19961208">And I think that Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Griffin case, that -- that he reached the proper view of that case when he made reference to it and said that that case actually was decided, not upon a full faith and credit question involving a judgment but it was rather upon a conflict of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.381" offset="20077505">The law of Virginia was, that she could not have support if she had left her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.638" offset="20106449">Whereas, the law in the District of Columbia might well have been that she could have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.483" offset="20133930">Now, when we started through the lower Appeals Courts, Judge Gorman depended entirely upon Thompson versus Thompson as his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.925" offset="20199654">When he said this is a matrimonial domicile and matrimonial domicile was in Florida and Ohio had no right to enter a judgment in favor of Mrs. Armstrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.393" offset="20241554">And he maintained that position until, I think, he filed his reply brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.729" offset="20266841">And then for the first time, he -- he seems to stray away from that thought and to say that he places his dependance here, upon his claim that the proceedings in Florida gave to Mrs. Armstrong, due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.920" offset="20339670">And therefore, they should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="5116.282" offset="20465058">We depended upon Pawley versus Pawley as to the law of Florida, Slapp versus Slapp as to the law of Ohio for our claim that the Florida Court, if it had a right to grant her a divorce, could divorce -- a right to grant him a divorce could divorce her.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.311" offset="20553143">But it couldn't deny her alimony because she was not within the jurisdiction of the Court, so far as her personal rights were concerned or her property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.164" offset="20592640">And in that connection, may I suggest one of the -- Your Honors, asked Judge Gorman the question about the law of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.992" offset="20631928">When this Court decided the first Williams case, holding that it would recognize, and the Full Faith and Credit Clause the right of any court having jurisdiction of one of the parties who was properly domiciled, and granted divorce, that all other States should recognize but indicating that such could not apply to property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.963" offset="20747807">This court was not saying something it was new to what has long been the law of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.671" offset="20774661">Because in 1869, the Supreme Court of Ohio decided the very question, that has since, the decisions of this Court, referring to divisible divorce should come in to national prominence decided exactly as this Court has decided on that subject of divisible divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.301" offset="20861179">That Ohio would recognize the right of any other State having one of the parties domiciled in its boundaries to grant a divorce but would deny to that other State the right to have it's jurisdiction extend beyond it's boarders and affect property rights in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.044" offset="20948114">And through out the years, almost 80 years since that first case of Cox versus Cox in the 19th Ohio State was decided it has been the unbroken law of Ohio, that Ohio applies what has come to be called the rule of divisible divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.610" offset="21034423">That a divorce maybe granted to protect offspring or subsequent wives or innocent parties but it cannot be, it cannot have the effect of destroying property or personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.302" offset="21145182">Now, one word if I may, in answer to the some of the things that was said by Judge Gorman and in answer to some of the questions of the Court about, what this Florida decree actually does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.495" offset="21193979">As I see it, it didn't decide anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.248" offset="21204950">And in that connection it should be read together with the master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.101" offset="21232327">If Your Honors will look at page 243.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.513" offset="21286034">No, 244, at the middle paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.981" offset="21299827">Now, this is the master's report the question of the wife's alimony, if any, cannot be determined that this stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.861" offset="21355416">And then goes on to say, that she has in her possession these bonds and stocks, and money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.037" offset="21396062">In addition thereto, she has half interest in properties in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.301" offset="21413198">So, the statements of Judge Gorman made that the reference in the Ohio -- Florida courts was only to the partition action is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.981" offset="21443918">I assume that this will be the subject matter of litigation in Ohio and that the properties position will be made by the courts of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.318" offset="21485192">And then, the final decree of the Court, which was entered the next day after that master's report, was filed does not in anyway change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.922" offset="21551647">It merely recognized as has been pointed out that this litigation was pending in Ohio and that the Ohio courts would have the right to make settlement of the property rights of the parties in Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="5427.415" offset="21709636">I don't see any other place that it would have in the case unless, it was put there purposely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.784" offset="21763135">As I have said in another branch in my brief, to create questions that would subsequently arise in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.369" offset="21797407">Because I think that both the master commission and Mr. William Ward who appeared as the attorney for the plaintiff in this case were fully cognizant for a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.247" offset="21844950">Now, that Florida courts had no jurisdiction to defy this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.089" offset="21868356">Mrs. Armstrong was not before the Court, general Motors Corporation was not before the Court and the security themselves were not in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.055" offset="21908167">Mr. Ward is a very -- very good lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.515" offset="21926034">And he's a good strategist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.566" offset="21934184">And he knows this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.588" offset="21942335">He was counsel for Mrs. Pawley in the Pawley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.160" offset="21960620">So, he was not unfamiliar with what he was doing.</text>
