          <turn speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="12.490" stopTime="515.777">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock</label>
            <text syncTime="12.490" offset="49946">This case brings before the Court a controversy as to the effect of an increase in a utilities filed rate on its contract to sell at a previous lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.909" offset="111595">United Gas Pipe Line Company, which is the petitioner in Number 17, is an interstate natural gas company within the meaning of that term as used in the Natural Gas Act, meaning a company that is generally subject to regulation under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.161" offset="176588">And that company has on file with the Federal Power Commission under the regulations of that Commission relating to the filing of rates in accordance with the filed rate procedure of the Natural Gas Act, its rates for the sales which are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.578" offset="246282">The Mobile Gas Service Corporation, which is the respondent in both of these cases is a local distributor of gas in Mobile, Alabama, of gas which it purchases from the United Gas Pipe Line Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.808" offset="307200">The specific question here presented is whether under the rate filing provisions of the Natural Gas Act, the Federal Power Commission properly accepted a utilities filing of an increase in its filed rate, pending a hearing on the increased rate where the utility had a contract to sell at a previous rate and the customer objected to the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.468" offset="409809">Now, the previous filings which are here involved began with the filing of the basic contract which had been entered into in 1936 and which was to continue until 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.674" offset="466651">That contract was filed with the Federal Power Commission in 1938, following the enactment of the Natural Gas Act and the promulgation of the Commission's rules requiring the filing of rate schedules and designated as that company's rate Schedule number 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.524" offset="534047">It was filed in a sort of hybrid way which is in accordance with the practice of the Commission, whereby the contract serves two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.791" offset="579082">The definition in the contract of the rate and the service constitute the rate, the schedule of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.806" offset="611161">The contract is also filed as a contract relating to that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.291" offset="637074">In 1941, an amendment was filed designated as Supplement number 7 to that rate schedule number 20, which change the contract term by extending it until 1962 and provided for a price of 80% to 90% of the buyer's owned price for industrial gas with a minimum of 16 cents per Mcf to United Gas Pipe Line Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.922" offset="763611">In 1946, a further amendment was filed which altered the 80% to 90% ratios for a particular industrial resale to a -- to the Ideal Cement Company for a period of 10 years and waived the 16 cent minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.030" offset="848039">The resale price to the Ideal Cement Company which Mobile would charge would be 12 cents per Mcf and United would take its 80% to 90% of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.665" offset="898612">Now, in 1952, pursuant to new regulations of the Federal Power Commission, United filed what were called conversion terms, converting all of its prior filings into a new compact and general tariff with separate sheets for separate types of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.769" offset="979069">The effect of that tariff was to substitute a rate of 10.7 cents per Mcf for the old revenue sharing rate of 80 to 90, a flat-cent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.700" offset="1038733">And to redefine the service, the practices with respect to measurement and billing and the provisions with respect to the BTU content of the gas to eliminate the tax adjustment clause so that the rate would be definite, not only in cents, but would not be subject to adjustment because of tax changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.320" offset="1137267">To prescribe a new form of service agreement within individual customers, which would be the only form of contract thereafter to be entered into with any individual customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.005" offset="1195990">And in lieu of a presently effective service contract to carry forward, stipulated provisions of the old contract which are designated in that filing and which were not superseded by the new rate and service provisions of the new tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.233" offset="1264849">On August the 1st of 1952, the Federal Power Commission allowed that conversion tariff to take effect in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.985" offset="1303928">It set a hearing on the other part and suspended the other part, the other part consisting of United's rates governing its services and sales to other pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.291" offset="1365159">Those were increased at the same time and the Commission suspended those increases and set a hearing on them, but on the -- on the changes which affected this rate to Mobile which were changes in form leaving a 10.7 cent rate in effect which was the equivalent of what the average payment under the old rate had been and therefore involved no substantial change as of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.071" offset="1484278">That was allowed to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.675" offset="1494622">Now, the controverted filing which is involved here occurred on June the 24th, 1953 when United filed two new sheets increasing this 10.7 cent per Mcf rate to 14.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.608" offset="1570377">The same time it requested waiver of the 30-day notice requirement of the statute and asked that the new increase rate go into effect in 20 days on July the 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.075" offset="1624294">There's no issue here about that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.054" offset="1632131">I might just explain that the statute does permit the Commission for good cause shown to permit a rate to go into effect without the 30-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.584" offset="1666299">And the Commission in that instance refused to do that and by an order that was issued on July the 10th ordered that the rate should not go into effect in advance of 30 days, leaving it to go into effect at the end of the 30 days provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.703" offset="1738710">It set a hearing on all the new rates which were provided for, the increase rates which were provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.103" offset="1772356">It consolidated that hearing with hearings which were already pending on United's rates, on all of United's rates and suspended all of the increase except the one increase here involved in the amount charged for gas resold by Mobile to the Ideal Cement Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.972" offset="1859814">That being a sale of gas for resale for industrial use fell within the provisions of the Power Act which are printed on page 102 of our brief, the provision that the Commission shall not have authority to suspend the rate charge classification or service with the sale of natural gas for resale for industrial use only.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.522" offset="1954064">So, that rate could not be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.126" offset="1964408">It went into effect then on July the 25th, but the Commission did by this order set a hearing on that together with all other rates and consolidated that hearing with the pending, the proceeding that was then pending before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.698" offset="2014772">I may say incidentally that this prohibition on suspending industrial rates is one which the Commission has year after year recommended to Congress be repealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.194" offset="2176731">The legislative history of the provision is somewhat obscure, but the explanation -- that seems as good as an explanation as any if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.650" offset="2230544">The Mobile's petition filed four weeks later asked that the Commission modify the order which had entered on July 10th in these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.315" offset="2281221">It asked that it reject the filing of the increase for this industrial gas to Mobile, reject the filing or alternatively that it set a separate hearing on the rate to Mobile and that it provide for refund to Mobile of any excess ultimately determined over what the Commission should ultimately determine to be a just and reasonable rate for this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.511" offset="2398041">The Commission on December the 7th entered the order which is here under review, dismissing Mobile's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.003" offset="2427925">It refused to reject United's proffered rate increase, pointing out that although there was a previous contract for the earlier rate, the rate schedule of filing conforms to the Act and to the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.118" offset="2504411">It said that it was the only way in which a natural gas company could increase its rates by filing its -- its increase with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.360" offset="2541401">The Commission refused to separate the proceedings from the other hearing saying that the issues as to the reasonableness of this rate to Mobile involved very many common issues with all of the other rates of the United Gas Pipe Line and it declined to order a refund saying that the Commission's authority with respect to refunds was limited to those cases in which it had power to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.128" offset="2652473">There is no issue presented here on the refund in view of the decision taken by the court below, but I might just say that the Commission's basis for that is found in the provision of Section 4 (e) on -- printed in our brief at page 102 where the Act says, “If the proceeding has not been concluded at the expiration of the suspension period, on the motion of the natural gas company, the proposed change shall go into effect,” and then the next sentence, “where increased rates or charges are thus made effective, the Commission may by order require the natural gas company to furnish a bond to refund with interest, the portion of such increase rates or charges by its decision filed and not justified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.829" offset="2839301">Based on that as it seems, the clear reading of the statute, the Commission declined to refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.788" offset="5411109">That's -- there's an awful lot of law on that, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.808" offset="5427200">But our -- the Mobile then on -- on a denial of its petition, petition for rehearing, rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.784" offset="5459069">It petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Third -- Second Circuit for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.225" offset="5472862">The Third Circuit reversed with Judge Hastie dissented and United and the Federal Power Commission petitioned for certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.909" offset="5511628">Now, the problem is solely on the statutory construction as Mobile agreed in -- in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.026" offset="5552065">That question is, “Did Congress exempt filed rates from change by a new filing in cases where the customer has a contract for the old rate and objects?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.302" offset="5597205">We believe that a careful reading of the statutory terms will show that the Commission read them correctly and I might start out by saying that Sections 4 and 5 (a) are the Sections that are here involved and I'll just point out that Section 5 (a) is the usual provision that appears on page 103 of our brief and 104.5 (a) is the usual provision that the Commission may investigate rates if it finds them unlawful may prescribe just and reasonable rates to be thereafter observed and enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.456" offset="5721757">That's the Commission fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.941" offset="5727713">Now, 4 is -- Section 4 is the rate we have here involved, the two subsections which precedes (c) that appears on page 101 are the sections which established the standards, statutory standard, (a) says, “Rates must be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.644" offset="5790511">(b) says they must be not unduly discriminatory or preferential.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.635" offset="5806498">Those are the two Sections establishing the statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.476" offset="5821858">Then, we come to (c) and (c) says that, “Every natural gas company must file its -- all of its rates which are subject to a regulation of the Commission with the Commission and file all contracts affecting or relating to such rates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.509" offset="5905972">Now, the effect of that filed rate procedure is under the -- under the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.400" offset="5929587">It's just what it is under the Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.363" offset="5941394">As this Court said in the Montana-Dakota case, petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed rate, whether it's fixed or merely accepted by the Commission and not even a Court can authorize the Commerce and the commodity on other terms than those that are filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.574" offset="6022269">Section (d) then is the one which provides for the changing of rates which are on file with the Commission.It starts out, “Unless the Commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any natural gas company in any such rate, charge, classification or service or in any rule, regulation or contract relating thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.645" offset="6102518">And I'd like to interrupt myself to say that the statute speaks of a change made by the natural gas company, not by the parties to the contract or not by the Commission made by the natural gas company and it speaks equally of a change in a rate and a change in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.714" offset="6174824">And then, I might say that Mobile objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.352" offset="6189349">“How can these words of prohibition, no change shall be made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.267" offset="6205022">They tortured into an affirmative grant of power to change a contract, but Mobile's objection ignores the exception which follows, for the statute goes on to say, “No change shall be made except after 30 days notice to the Commission and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.443" offset="6261760">Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the change or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then enforced and the time when the change or changes will go into effect.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.384" offset="8181447">The rate provisions of Section 4 of the Act show that a natural gas company cannot make or file with the Commission a change in rates contemplated and required by Section 4 (d) and so that the Commission cannot permit or accept, but must reject the filing of a change in rate for the natural gas company until first such private contract is set aside as against the public interest in a proceeding brought specially for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.019" offset="8528039">The second question presented is whether Congress in the Natural Gas Act has empowered the Federal Power Commission by its own order or the Court's empowered to direct the Commission by order to require a refund of moneys collected from a change in rates for the sale of natural gas for a resale for industrial use only, where those rates are not subject to suspension under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.748" offset="8862929">In every contract and in every amendment which was filed, the Commission put up what I call a caveat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.510" offset="8902008">The last one on the one, on the particular contract involved here is set verbatim on page 4 of my brief, in which the Commission said that, “In permitting these contracts to be filed, that Act was not to be construed by it as any approval of any contract right or term, claimed or asserted by virtue of the contract filed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.167" offset="9008588">Now, we say -- United says that by that caveat, Mobile and United were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.708" offset="9046831">That the Commission did nothing in permitting supplement 10 to supplement 7 to be filed, except to permit the money arrangement itself and that the Commission never at any time approved that portion of the contract which was a firm contract for firm rates for a firm period, which I say and will undertake to develop in a moment was contrary to the scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.695" offset="9154769">Now, secondly, with this conversion tariff, by the rules and regulations of the Commission, all price index and percentage arraignments and Tax Adjustment Clause which was a 100% of supplement 10 to supplement 7 were outlawed and prohibited and we were compelled to file a conversion tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.985" offset="9243899">Also, by the rules and regulations of the Commission, Section 154.85, we were required to file as a service agreement those portions of the several contracts not superseded and replaced by the conversion tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.697" offset="9318713">We filed that statement and that statement showed that supplement 10 to supplement 7 in its entirety was dropped because it was in conflict with the applicable rules and regulations and that docket G2019 in 1952, the Commission ordered that conversion tariff as to these rates filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.583" offset="9406276">Mobile did not object to the statement that dropped supplement 10 to supplement 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.835" offset="9427278">United did not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.555" offset="9434175">Nobody took a 19 (b) appeal and in the court below, we contended under the sunshine and for side case that was res judicata and that the contract thereupon and thereby was replaced and that the contract which the court below ordered, reinstated had not been in existence for more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.246" offset="9512960">Now, I come to the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.610" offset="9526439">In Section 1 (a), the Congress declares that it is its purpose to take over what we may call the (Inaudible) gap with which this Court is familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.331" offset="9565309">It said that that business was affected with a public interest and required regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.448" offset="9589760">In Section 4 (a), it declared that all rates should be just and reasonable and that any rate, not just unreasonable was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.311" offset="9633228">No exceptions, no provisos, no evens and buts, either just unreasonable or unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.214" offset="9660813">It did not rest on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.500" offset="9665933">It came to Section 4 (b) and it got specific and it said, “No natural gas company shall charge or demand or collect a rate that is tainted with undue preference or advantage or undue reasonableness between classes of the same service or localities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.334" offset="9753287">When it came to Section 4 (c), it required the natural gas company within a time certain to file all rate schedules and conditions of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.586" offset="9790276">Together with is the language of the Act and the Court will find that set out in the appendix to my brief on page 3, “together with,” says the Act, “all contracts relating thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.641" offset="9854537">In Section 4 (b), I remind you, this Court has said that Section 4 is the heart of this Act and as we go along, I shall undertake to describe the fact that rate-wise, Section 4 is the point of inception and origin of all rate business before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.961" offset="9931755">It is where the stream and the volume of the Commission business arises and comes in to full bloom and Section 5 (a) is the policeman of the Act and by which the Commission can dial in to be sure that proper performance is held.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.954" offset="10239791">Whenever it became necessary from day-to-day to preserve and maintain just and unreasonable, what is just and unreasonable, equal and uniform application of the same rate to all members of the same class at all times, and the statute inception 4 (a) did not accept one single solitary condition whether it'd be private contract, whether it'd be whatever inducements make a private contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.978" offset="10355879">Now, Mobile did not file a 5 (a) as it could have done here to allege that any rate was unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.098" offset="10780317">And the Commission says, "No, we deny that because this is a consolidated proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.961" offset="11075814">Our authority to refund is limited solely to suspendable rates and that brings the issue here.</text>
