            <label>Mr. William H. Webb</label>
            <text syncTime="40.722" offset="162795">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.929" offset="175647">I shall refer to petitioners as Cold Metal and the respondent as United.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.861" offset="215353">This case like the one which has just been argued to Your Honors involves the proper construction of amended Rule 54 (b), the applicability of the rule to this case and the validity of the rule if it is given the broad or affirmative construction which has been accorded to the rule by several Courts of Appeals including the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Bendix case and also in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.131" offset="356519">More specifically, this case involves the question whether a judgment entered on Cold Metal's claim is a final judgment because it contains the talismanic language of amended Rule 54 (b), even though there remains completely unadjudicated, a counterclaim filed by United and which the Court of Appeals held arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as Cold Metal's claim and which seeks a recoupement or set off against the very judgment from which United appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.492" offset="577933">Now, the Court of Appeals, on Cold Metal's motion to dismiss United's appeal, held the judgment final and appealable in view of the fact that it contains the findings or certificate specified in amended Rule 54 (b) and despite the fact that the judgment does not adjudicate even a whole claim and certainly does not adjudicate the counterclaim arising out of the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.613" offset="718367">I think the factual background of this case points up even more strongly than the Sears case, devices inherent in this so-called affirmative construction of amended Rule 54 (b) as enunciated by the Third Circuit in the Bendix case and in this case and by a panel of the Court in the Second Circuit and also by the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.095" offset="852323">It points up the fact that that construction, that affirmative construction actually invests the District Court with power to fix and determine the jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeal and this Court in contravention of Section 1291 of 28 U.S.C. and in contravention of this Court's prior determinations of what constitutes a final judgment under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.381" offset="997460">The Court's construction and application of the rule in the case at bar will inevitably lead, of course, to a further appeal on the same transactions or occurrences as those involved in the present appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.705" offset="1074782">I shall state the facts rather completely so that Your Honors will fully appreciate the nature of this rather lengthy controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.396" offset="1297554">In my view, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held in the Bendix case and in this case that if the District Court will insert in its order the talismanic language of Rule 54 -- amended Rule 54 (b) then that judgment becomes a final and appealable judgment and it makes no difference to the Court of Appeals whether that this judgment comes within the proper scope of Section 1291 as construed and applied by this Court in earlier years.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.769" offset="1723037">I think that's the -- the view as expressed by the Court in the Bendix case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.193" offset="1760758">I think I would like, before going to the facts, to state to Your Honors what I believe to be an answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's questions or a few of them that he asked during the preceding argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.353" offset="1829407">I think the question came up as to the effects of amended Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="464.828" offset="1859291">I'd like to take first the effects of amended Rule 54 (b) when given the negative -- so-called negative construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.423" offset="1901610">And to that, if you have a determination made by the District Court as specified in the rule and that is carried into the judgment, then everyone knows that the District Court is perfectly willing to relinquish the -- that phase of the case, that it's through with that particular claim and the parties know then that an appeal should be taken if the judgment complies with Section 1291 and is a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.118" offset="2020415">Now, if the determination specified in the rule is not made then this means that the District Court is -- wants to hang on to that particular phase of the case and everybody knows that the judgment is not final and that no appeal can be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.835" offset="2095334">Now, let's go for just a moment to the affirmative construction of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.560" offset="2114142">I think that it brings about the following results.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.497" offset="2137966">First, it alters the statutory concept of appealability through the promulgation of rules of District Court procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.832" offset="2179239">Second, it enlarges appellate jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals and of this Court, extending appellate jurisdiction to judgments which were not previously appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.826" offset="2275265">You mean Congress acting in conjunction with this Court in promulgating rules and in exercising their power in conjunction with the Court's powers haven't done that?</text>

            <text syncTime="576.553" offset="2306194">I don't think so, may I say that there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.743" offset="2322913">In the first place, Section 1291, of course, was reenacted in the law after amended Rule 54 (b) was promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.563" offset="2362201">In the second place, the situation under the law as it stands now is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.681" offset="2394697">Congress has given this Court power to fix rules of procedure in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.413" offset="2429597">It has delegated authority to this Court in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.630" offset="2446420">Now, under this so-called affirmative construction, this Court in turn has delegated that power to the District Courts because the District Courts acting within their discretion have the power to determine what is and what is not a final judgment and it's purely discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.871" offset="2535445">I don't believe that there's anything in the historical background of these rules with -- or of the statutes which would even indicate that either Congress or this Court have the slightest intent of placing, on a purely discretionary basis in the hands of the District Court, a complete determination of this matter of -- of appealability, the appealable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.899" offset="2643592">And then another thing, Your Honor, I do believe that this Court in response to the statutory command of Congress would have the power to set forth in a rule, to define by a rule what is a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.433" offset="2721646">But I don't believe that that is what has been done in amended Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="690.460" offset="2761770">There is no definition in amended Rule 54 (b) at all of what constitutes a final judgment that is --</text>
