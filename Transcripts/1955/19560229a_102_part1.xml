            <label>Mr. Charles F. Barber</label>
            <text syncTime="40.252" offset="160914">This case is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court sitting in the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.285" offset="197068">The case arises under the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.451" offset="217757">It confirms the distinction between common carriers and contract carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.114" offset="256418">Those terms are used in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.054" offset="272196">This is the distinction this Court has noted that Congress has preserved throughout the Act and upon which the economic regulation of the motor carrier industry is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.089" offset="332278">The nub of the distinction is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.605" offset="346384">A common carrier is one which undertakes to serve or hold itself out to serve the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.639" offset="390478">A contract carrier, on the other hand, are carriers for hire that operate under individual contracts and agreements and are not common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.935" offset="451709">The two types of carriers are mutually exclusive and embrace all carriers, all motor carriers for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.618" offset="490371">Appellee in this case held a contract carrier permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.169" offset="516598">It was found by the Commission to have conducted operations as a common carrier unauthorized by its permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.639" offset="558498">We have two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.021" offset="572082">First, whether the Commission's finding is supported by the evidence, and second, whether the remedial order entered by the Commission is void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.095" offset="624327">The so-called specialization test discussed in the brief is in our view a part of the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.624" offset="662465">It goes to the specificity of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.375" offset="685453">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.098" offset="696320">Appellee was issued a contract carrier permit in 1940 on proof that he operated a highly specialized carrier service for three shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.475" offset="753894">The service that he offered was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.972" offset="763820">He had 10 trucks and trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.887" offset="775523">They were equipped to carry extra length steel reinforcing bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.103" offset="808333">The motor carrier report filed by the Commission in the permit case says that the bars were up to 90-feet in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.954" offset="855771">Such bars were used in highway, culvert and bridge construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.158" offset="876565">They require delivery in many cases far off established highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.585" offset="898299">The drivers were trained to follow the engineer's survey marks and to deliver their loads of steel often in the absence of any of the consignees' representatives by locating the engineering mark in the field and leaving the steel bars there.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.097" offset="980323">By the spring of 1951, the proof showed, appellee had listed with the Commission 13 contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.927" offset="1011670">Eleven of these were with Kansas City shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.670" offset="1022642">Only one was with an Illinois Steel Company, none was with an Iowa shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.029" offset="1044062">As you look at the names of the companies, you see they are steel companies and construction companies by and large.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.014" offset="1088052">At this point, in 1951, appellee underwent a burst of expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.337" offset="1117309">Less than a year later, in March 1952, it had 69 contracts including eight with Illinois Steel Company and 47 with Iowa Shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.120" offset="1168405">As you rundown the list of companies with which he had contracts, they include a range of light engineering companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.654" offset="1198602">Maytag is one, Furnace Company, a good many familiar names among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.144" offset="1228487">It's no wonder that a group of small common carriers engaged in the business of hauling livestock from Chicago or from Iowa farms to the Chicago area and depending for their return load on steel products, which they had been certificated to carry by the Commission, became alarmed and brought this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.658" offset="1310616">What did the proof show?</text>
            <text syncTime="329.705" offset="1318766">How did appellee accomplish this extraordinary expansion in a short period?</text>

            <text syncTime="354.269" offset="1416986">That's one aspect of it, doesn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Barber</label>
            <text syncTime="355.622" offset="1422420">Well, that -- that goes to an important aspect of the proof in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.248" offset="1440914">When the original permit was issued, appellee showed that he had 10 trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.316" offset="1465260">Each of which could carry these oversized steel bars up to 90-feet in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.977" offset="1495876">The substance of the complaint in this case is that he had departed from that sort of business and was now engaged in quite a different type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.838" offset="1539344">All be it within the scope of his permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.774" offset="1551047">I might explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.671" offset="1554599">His permit was founded on the special requirements of these oversized bars used in bridges, culverts and highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.237" offset="1592947">In -- when he was making a delivery, he, of course, carried other steel products use in highway constructions, tapes and clamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.285" offset="1629100">There are number of things that he listed in his proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.472" offset="1641848">His permit covered -- steel products and steel articles and other products used and useful in highway construction except sand gravel and several other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.993" offset="1687928">Now then, later on at the period of his complaint, he was using the other things to transport the -- the part of his permits which applied to other than steel bars.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.137" offset="1932539">At the other end of the market, the proof shows that he appointed a divisional manager whose office was at Des Moines and who actively solicited accounts in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.296" offset="1977156">He was extraordinarily successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.484" offset="1985933">The proof show that this man working in Iowa was able to sign up every steel receiver of consequence in the Des Moines area, a total of 16 contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.802" offset="2035148">Moreover, appellee behaved in other ways like a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.850" offset="2051344">There's a true bill in evidence, on page 93 of the record, showing an interchange of shipment with a common carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.952" offset="4399752">He would have to show public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.573" offset="4414276">And as we all know in an industry which is well-developed, it is not easy for a carrier to show public convenience and necessity for traffic that is well-taken care of by existing common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.711" offset="4482821">So, his problem under this order, if he decides not to come in for a common carrier, a certificate which, of course, is an alternative open to him, his problem will be to reform his operations so that they meet the test of a contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.409" offset="4569548">If, for example, he -- his modus operandi becomes as it was when he got his contract carrier permit, there is no question about what the Commission would enter an order finding him in compliance with the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.462" offset="4665783">If a carrier serves a very few shippers, so that he operates virtually as a part of the shipper's organization, an example is the contract carrier who carries for A.N.P.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.450" offset="4761704">On the other hand, if a carrier has highly specialized equipment, the Commission finds that it meets this requirement of the Act for individual contracts and agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.025" offset="4832026">Now, as you increase the number of carriers in order to qualify as a contract carrier, the Commission requires a higher degree of specialization in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.338" offset="4889287">One of the largest contract carriers in terms of number of customers is a carrier which has a service in metropolitan areas of moving checks from banks to the clearing house and clearing house to the banks.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert N. Burchmore</label>
            <text syncTime="1956.406" offset="7825554">Four years ago, I left my office to attend a hearing in this proceeding which was held by the Commission in Chicago upon the complaint of some competitors of the client, the appellee, from whom he had attracted some of their trucking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.017" offset="7907997">Rather than compete in the marketplace of carriage, his competitors chose to attack the appellee before the Interstate Commerce Commission and alleged that he was violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.459" offset="7965780">The Commission set the case for hearing and the hearing lasted long enough to make a 60-page record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.510" offset="8002038">It started with the examiner's usual announcement of what the Commission had set for hearing and this is, you will see from the record, was followed by the complainant searching the hearing room for some officer or a person from the defendant appellee and he could question as to his operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.528" offset="8090018">There being none in the room, they proceeded to testify, practitioner himself offering the testimony that a large number of contracts had appeared in the Commission's files as having been entered into by this defendant appellee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.332" offset="8173296">There was not a word of evidence as to what the contracts contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.295" offset="8193149">They were not offered in evidence, although they were on file before the Commission and the Commission never took the trouble to examine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.591" offset="8226273">All that was really laid before the Commission in that hearing was the quantity of business that was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.077" offset="8260232">We were doing too much business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.295" offset="8273084">I'll come back to that because the statutory definitions of carriers is not -- does not hinge upon quantitative elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.277" offset="8321045">It hinges upon qualitative elements not how much business a carrier does but what kind of business it does and in what manner it does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.004" offset="8376007">Beyond the matter of how many contracts had been entered into, there were these other elements which I, with all respect to the Commission, termed trivia, namely, a bill of lading which showed that one shipment that had been carried under a contract properly on file with the Commission in accordance with its regulations had been “interchanged” with another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.950" offset="8495752">In other words, the appellee had not carried the shipment from its first origin to final destination but had picked up the shipment from another carrier to take it to destination for its contracting party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.876" offset="8559491">Now, I should not labor a trivial matter but just by way of illustration, let me describe to the Court that in transportation parlance, and as the Commission well knows, interchange is a term of art having to do with a movement of goods where one carrier transports them partway and turns them over to another to be transported the rest of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.957" offset="8655726">And there are myriad of arrangements of combination or joint-through rates which is not necessary to go into here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.801" offset="8695118">Ordinarily speaking, the Commission has said, “Contract carriers do not interchange shipments with common carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.964" offset="8727824">That is true and we have not interchanged shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.808" offset="8747154">But it being necessities of commerce that people who employ contract carriers be able to have the facility of moving their goods by their contract carrier and fence beyond when the goods need to move beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.921" offset="8815595">The Commission, in a formal proceeding, held that it is entirely proper for a contract carrier to carry for one of its contracting parties a shipment and then at the end of the line of that contract carrier, to act as the agent of his contracting party for the purpose of placing the goods in the hands of some other carrier, common or contract, to move beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.901" offset="8931579">So the physical movement of the goods is permitted and it is done in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.257" offset="8956970">There was no evidence at this hearing as to how the so-called interchange was performed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.851" offset="9003363">But the reason I call it trivia is because no matter how it was performed, it was merely a matter of forum and not of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.736" offset="9042860">If we made the mistake of using the wrong papers, that was all the mistake we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.724" offset="9082880">We could have accomplished the same result by using different forms of papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.359" offset="9113391">Now, at the conclusion of the hearing --</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.119" offset="9148395">That was a -- a listing in the Chicago motor traffic directory which blazoned across the page that we were a carrier and we hauled steel between Chicago and Iowa and we offered daily service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.655" offset="9222583">There was no evidence as to whether that paper in which that circular was printed was circulated to the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.395" offset="9261558">All the record show is this, that it was put in the hands of Chicago shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.917" offset="9287576">We may as well not have any question about it from the beginning of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.428" offset="9309623">This carrier did go out after business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.272" offset="9325087">He went out and negotiated new contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.703" offset="9334805">He wanted to increase his business and he did increase his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.023" offset="9364062">We think that a contract carrier has the right to do that and this Section 903 of the Act specifically says that nothing shall prevent the right of a carrier to add to his or its contracts or substitute contracts as the -- as the demands of the public and the requirements in his business dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.844" offset="9459357">But in any event, that ad or listing did not hold out an indiscriminate service to the public generally to take the business of all commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.172" offset="9516617">It's simply dated boldly that we are in business and we do hold traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.202" offset="9540754">Now, if pursuant to that ad and there is no -- nothing in the record to show that this happened, if it had happened that a shipper saw that and approached the carrier, the carrier still would be wholly within his rights and acting properly if he negotiated with the shipper, the terms on the possibilities and the methods of entering into a contract and performing as a contract carrier or not performing it.</text>
