            <label>Mr. David P. Findling</label>
            <text syncTime="34.330" offset="137300">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.733" offset="150883">The National Labor Relations Board has brought this case here on certiorari to review an order of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remanding the case to the Board with instructions to take evidence regarding the union officer's status of a CIO agent named W.B. Taylor for purposes of the non-Communist affidavit requirements of Section 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.378" offset="281496">As Your Honors may recall, Section 9 (h) which has already been before the Court in three Labor Board cases, the ACA against Douds case, the Highland Park case, and the Dant and the -- and the Russell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.693" offset="346697">It provides generally that labor unions may not have access to the Labor Board's facilities unless their officers file appropriate non-Communist affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.923" offset="399673">And the questions in this case, which I shall formulate more specifically in just a minute, involve generally the meaning of the word "officer" and its litigability in Board cases and they arose in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.621" offset="474384">During a conventional unfair labor practice proceeding before the Board under Section 10 of the Act, involving allegations with respect to the discriminatory firings of three union employees and restraint and coercion of employees but of course they had adjoined Local 20 of the Brewery Workers International Union affiliated with the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.459" offset="581799">The company raised the question which it tried to litigate before the hearing officer and the Board whether the CIO had in fact complied in as much as no non-Communist affidavits had been filed by Mr. Taylor and under the Highland Park decision of this Court, it was necessary for the CIO to have filed the affidavits in order to validate the charges filed by Local 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.130" offset="700500">Now, Taylor was regional director for the CIO in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.175" offset="720666">The regional directors with whom they were then 40 were not listed by the CIO in its constitution as among its officers nor were they included in a verified form which under Board regulations was required to be filed with the Board and which the CIO had filed and which would likewise suppose to list the -- the officers of the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.547" offset="830171">But the company contended that Mr. Taylor had to file an affidavit anyway because as it in substance offered to prove in the unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.736" offset="878864">As Regional Director, he was charged with administrative and executive duties and powers over Local 20, and he exercised a working control over every CIO local union and affiliated international union in its territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.335" offset="953260">Now, the Board rejected this company's offense and offered to prove -- and offer a proof and it held two things, and it's the correctness of these two holdings that present the specific questions, the decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.351" offset="1021388">In the first place, the Board held in accordance with its consistent practice since the enactment of Section 9 (h) in 1947 that the question whether all union officers had in fact filed the appropriate non-Communist affidavit like other questions go into details with respect to compliance was not open to litigation in the proceedings on the merits of cases before the Board but was a matter for independent administrative determination by the Board in separate collateral proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.688" offset="1178749">And secondly, the Board held that in any event on the merits and even if the company had presented its question properly from a procedural standpoint, Taylor was not an officer of the CIO because again under the Board's uniform test, he neither occupied a position which was designated as an office in the constitution of the CIO nor was there any assertion of proof that the office that he occupied had been omitted from the constitution or from designation as an office in order to circumvent or evade the filing requirements of Section 9 (h).</text>

            <text syncTime="582.513" offset="2330018">The Board, for example, could say that an affidavit was technically improper because let's say the jury wasn't effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.217" offset="2368784">I don't believe we have a hearing on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.796" offset="2375158">Now, of course, if there were an issue of fact that resolved -- required resolution, perhaps the union could demand a hearing and get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.306" offset="2405146">But I know of no case where there's been that kind of substantial problem where the Board has decomplied a union without a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.514" offset="2454047">That's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.836" offset="2471288">And so, as I say, the Board went on to consider the merits of the case and issued the usual remedial order on violations which it found of Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.879" offset="2519458">When the Board then petitioned the Court of Appeals for enforcement of the order, however, that Court, without reaching the merits of the case, remanded it to the Board in the order that I mentioned at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.639" offset="2578495">The order appears at page 541A of the record and was not accompanied by a separate opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.746" offset="2606916">But as we read the order, the Court held in substance that under the Highland Park decision of this Court, the question whether the CIO was in compliance with Section 9 (h) because of Mr. Taylor's failure to file an affidavit, was subject to litigation in the unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.907" offset="2695628">And further, the Court rejected the Board's test, which I've just described, for determining who are union officers and which I shall refer to as the constitutional passing for simplicity -- for purposes of simplicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.927" offset="2759680">And it instructed the Board to reopen the unfair labor practice case in order to permit the company to introduce testimony as to Taylor's functions and extent of jurisdiction as Regional Director of the CIO and to make relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law and certify them to the Court and it's to review those rulings that we brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.011" offset="2863961">Now, whether the Board's position is right or wrong depends, of course, upon what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.906" offset="2891546">And unfortunately, Congress not only did not define the word "officer" on the face of the statute but we haven't been able to find anything in the authoritative committee reports or in the debates that shows that Congress specifically considered the question of what the word "officer" should mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.892" offset="2975556">As we point out in our brief generally, Congress simply used the word "officer" and sometimes it used the words "union leaders" interchangeably apparently on the assumption that its meaning was perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.391" offset="3037518">And after examining the dictionaries and looking into some Board -- some Court decisions involving other statutes and arising in other context, I don't believe that they're conclusive either.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.427" offset="3093629">We've collected whatever we though might be helpful to the Court in our brief and the company has done the same thing in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.565" offset="3126230">And I don't believe it's worth spending any oral argument and time to discuss that aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.935" offset="3155696">I think that if any conclusions are to be drawn from these sources, they suggest that Congress had in mind high elective office in union.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.656" offset="3202612">And I believe that this Court in the Dant &amp; Russell case, well not of course specifically addressing itself to this question, apparently likewise assumed that because the Court's opinion revised it to the elective -- the fluid and elective nature of union officials and the election of new union officers as -- as presenting problem with respective continuous compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.695" offset="3310759">Similarly, while we think the legislative history, which I shall discuss in just a second, does show a clear congressional intention with respect to the non-litigability of compliance question, this Court held in the Highland Park case that one phase of compliance whether the CIO and the AF of L were labor organizations which were required to comply was litigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.763" offset="3434998">And -- and although we think and I shall argue this a little later on that the Highland Park case is clearly distinguishable and not controlling, nevertheless, we don't find anything in the legislative history that shows that Congress specifically considered the question whether the word "union officer" should be litigable in the same way as the word "labor organization" was held litigable in Highland Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.608" offset="3554429">And so, we're -- we're required to find the legislative intention in the statute generally and we're required to draw inferences as best we can as to what Congress intended from what it said and did in related connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.229" offset="3620885">And if there's anything that seems to us to be crystal clear about the congressional intention with respect to the administration of Section 9 (h) and its companion sections, 9 (f) and (g) which deal with financial and registration requirement, it seems to us to be that Congress realized and intended to avoid the very serious danger that administration of Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h) should be so complicated, so time consuming, so diverting the Board energies as to hopelessly delay, seriously complicate and impede administration of what Congress continued to regard as the Board's fundamental tasks of preventing unfair labor practices and resolving disputes concerning representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.352" offset="3845329">And it's the effectuation of that congressional intention that lies at the heart of our position here, as the Board stated in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.840" offset="3891304">That congressional intention is made plain, I think, time and time again during the course of passage of the amendments of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.024" offset="3928085">And as I think the key to the whole congressional approach to Section 9 (h) to the Communist problem in labor union as Congress sought to meet it in the Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.692" offset="3978762">It was that consideration for example which prompted the Congress to require the mere filing of non-Communist affidavits instead of requiring the Board to determine whether union officers were in fact Communist or not and to -- and to litigate the veracity of the non-Communist affidavits and whether the affidavits were truthful or not as the original -- both Senate and House bills would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.103" offset="4096313">And Senator Taft explained on at least three occasions that the change was made on the basis that representation proceedings might be indefinitely delayed if the Board were required to examine the character of union leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.685" offset="4174681">And he said that certification of representatives might be tied up for months and that endless delays in Board proceedings would result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.294" offset="5505149">The statute may be interpreted as the Court did in Highland Park as permitting litigation of a question like the word "labor organization" because, one, because it doesn't create the difficulties of administration, the delays and so on that Congress so clearly wanted to avoid whereas litigation of the union officer question and other details of compliance does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.359" offset="5617371">And the reason I say that one creates problems in the -- doesn't create problems necessarily and they ever does is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.814" offset="5647256">In the first place, as I suggested, the word "labor organization" has a statutory definition, the word "union officer" doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.954" offset="5679752">In the second place, it's rarely controverted in Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.900" offset="5699500">In the third place, once the Board decides that a given outfit is a labor organization, that's usually the end of the matter, it's fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.401" offset="5733564">On the other hand, applying a functional, a so-called functional test to determine whether a man is a union officer or not, as the court below and -- and the company would contend for, involves investigation, not only of a man's formal duties and responsibilities, it depends on his influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.658" offset="5826560">In this case, it depends on his working control, although what were in forms were about 88 CIO locals in Kentucky and 17 internationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.420" offset="5865639">It involves an exploration of the man's character, the grasp of his job, his personal relations with others and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.765" offset="7811030">And in the proceeding which involve the allegations that they fired three people because of union activities and engaged in restraint and coercion, not separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.197" offset="7856692">Now, there's -- there's all the difference in the world, Your Honors, from a practical standpoint, I think between conducting a separate administrative investigation into compliance and the kind of inquiry that would have been involved if we had gone along with the company's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.271" offset="7941016">For one thing, as I suggested earlier, if we had gone along with the company's position and permitted a litigation of the union officer status, of Taylor in this case, it's not very difficult to see how the merits of the case involving a simple factual question as to whether three men had been fired, because they had engaged in union activities and so on, would be completely submerged in this welter of side issues with respect to the compliance details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.274" offset="8077061">Beyond that and more importantly, if we'd gone ahead with -- with the investigation, exploration of the issues the company proposed, we'd have -- we have had to do it on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.327" offset="8133277">In other words, the determination whether Taylor was a union officer would be made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.308" offset="8153130">And it couldn't be made on a union by union basis because I think it's clear that any Board finding in this case, as to Taylor's union officer status, would not be res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.290" offset="8213107">In any other case involving unfair labor practices or representation proceeding, where another party tried to raise the same issue, he'd be entitled to make his own record as to the union officer status of a particular union agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.612" offset="8270367">Indeed, he might even be entitled to make his own record as to Taylor's union officer status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.179" offset="8292624">Certainly, that would be true if he had new evidence that he offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.005" offset="8307984">And so, that we'd have to be litigating it in every one of the thousands of unfair labor practice and representation cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.551" offset="8466181">For example, in this case, if the Board should find in this case, in the separate administrative proceedings, that the CIO was not in compliance because Mr. Taylor should have but had not filed an affidavit, that doesn't affect simply this case in which it happens to be litigated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.132" offset="8776516">Well, my guess would be about 20% perhaps go to formal hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.709" offset="8806818">So, they say the -- the administrative way of handling it has the advantage, well, it's almost a necessary way of handling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.066" offset="8848196">If you're going to handle compliance, the only way that the necessities of the situation require it be handled, that is on a union by union basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.337" offset="8889260">And beyond that, handling it administratively gives the Board the kind of flexibility that I've been talking about in handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.426" offset="8933669">In other words, we don't have to explore on the record of -- of a case by formal hearing necessarily, whether there have been compliance with the many details involved in 9 (f), (g) and (h), the Board can decide for itself whether the assertions made require a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.406" offset="9009528">Now, we have in one or two cases had formal hearings administratively to determine whether a union was in compliance or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.719" offset="9038785">But if the matter is to be litigated in the unfair labor practice proceeding itself, the thing -- that the thing has no flexibility at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.996" offset="9071909">And finally, there's a difference in the parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.095" offset="9084343">The administrative way of handling it means that the Board deals with the union which -- whose whole compliance situation is affected instead of the matter being left to resolution in a single case involving an employer who after all has at best, we think, a relevantly collateral interest in that -- in that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.332" offset="9173264">He's interested in defending himself against the unfair labor practice cases and the -- the provisions of the 9 (f), (g) and (h) weren't written into the statute to protect him as an individual again so that he'll have a defense to unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.862" offset="9291442">Now, even -- even if we were to assume, contrary to what the Court of Appeals in this case held, that the matter were the -- the definition of the word "union officer," the officer status of Mr. Taylor was a matter that could be determined by the Board administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.482" offset="9397917">We think that it would present the very serious problems of compliance and lapses and so on which this Court referred to in the Dant &amp; Russell case, changes in elections and so on which made compliance, at any given moment, a matter of happenstance and to make a continuos -- continuos compliance a matter of happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.347" offset="9477329">And I suggest that even in administrative determination and administrative inquiry, every time an assertion was made that a man's functions, the relationships have changed so that he was now a union officer would bar down the statute, and as a matter of fact, would result in many cases, in the very delays that Congress wanted to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.641" offset="9574504">As practical matter, many collective bargaining negotiations and several many representations cases where we have to check compliance several times during the investigation because the whole investigation depends on it would, as a practical matter, probably barred down because much of the work and negotiations would be subject to challenge later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.153" offset="9664575">Now, the -- the company has suggested that -- well, before I get to the company's suggestion, I'd like to address myself to one more point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.770" offset="9722984">We don't believe that this Court should attribute the kind of result that I have described in terms of the workable administration of the statute to -- to Congress unless its absolutely clear that to do so is necessary in order to achieve what Congress intended to achieve in writing Section 9 (h) into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.982" offset="9823922">And we don't think it is, quite the contrary we think that the Board's approach reasonably achieves that purpose and this is why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.082" offset="9856313">In the first place, the communism and Communist we know don't usually, certainly at least in connection with the union organizational activities, stand up to be counted anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.960" offset="9915768">And so, I think it's fair to assume that Congress realized that on any test of the word "officer," there was always the possibility that Communist would work themselves into positions of authority and influence and importance in labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.949" offset="9983791">Beyond that, we think that the company's contention in that respect overlooks the key fact that the approach that Congress made to the Communist problem in labor unions in our Act was not a direct head on approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.413" offset="10033633">It was a more or less indirect limited approach based on the necessities of administration of the other provisions of the Act with respect to unfair labor practices in representation cases that I've described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.233" offset="10100924">Now, it's significant, I think, that Congress took a more direct approach later on in the Communist Control Act of 1954, when it denied unions the privilege of representing employees for collective bargaining purposes and withdrew other benefits from them if they were Communist infiltrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.366" offset="10169365">But it's also significant that when Congress took that approach, it made the responsibility for administration and for the hearings and fact findings involved, not the job of the N.L.R.B. but the job of Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.173" offset="10232686">And as a matter of fact, in that report of the Joint Committee to which I've preferred made in 1948, the committee said that elimination of Communist partisans and adherence from official post and positions of responsibility in both national and local union is the one of the most pronounced and significant effects of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.685" offset="10338638">So that it seems clear that Congress thought that in 1947, when it wrote --</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.834" offset="10419304">But I say -- I thinks it's clear that in 1947, when Congress wrote Section 9 (h), it thought and the Joint Committee in 1948 agreed that even the limited approach with which the necessities of administration required that was made in the National Labor Relations Act would eliminate the main possibilities of Communist control of labor unions and of political strikes which were what Congress was after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.437" offset="10529646">And I think that in the absence of deliberate fraud or purpose of evasion which under the Board's rules are -- are prevented, it's reasonable to expect that the people who hold the positions that are designated as officers in the union's governing rules, constitutional bylaws, are usually as we show in our brief the -- occupied by people who command the greatest influence, who are the union leaders and who have the most authority among the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.377" offset="10681469">And as we show in our brief also, they usually constitute a substantial portion of the union's executive board, they're usually responsible for the hiring and firing of the personnel including Regional Director Taylor by the way, who was not an elective officer, he's appointed by one of the vice presidents of the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.848" offset="10763389">The vice president is an elective officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.906" offset="10775615">And they usually control the overall supervision and management of the union affairs on a day by day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.276" offset="10805081">So that as I say, I think that Congress could reasonably have expected that the Board's approach to this problem does tend to reach the main -- the most important people who have influence and authority in the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.602" offset="11810377">There are several things I would like to present to the Court in this short time that I have at my disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.323" offset="11841202">First of all, I would like to point to the Court that Congress has had an opportunity to look at this problem and to review the construction placed upon the compliance situation by the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.488" offset="11897940">And the action of Congress, I think, should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not the construction placed upon the Labor Board that these matters are not reviewable in Board proceedings on unfair labor practices or representation proceedings or that -- that the constitutional test of an officer that the Board has adopted whether a man is named in the constitution as an officer is an appropriate test, is a proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.789" offset="12023118">An amendment was offered before the Congress to enlarge the scope of the test made by the Board in applying the rule of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.160" offset="12072542">That amendment was offered in 1949 when the Senate considered a bill which would have enlarged the scope of what an officer is beyond a constitutional officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.494" offset="12125936">Two and I refer to page 58 of the Board brief to the members of all policy forming and governing bodies of the labor organization as well as those designated by such, by the constitution of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.779" offset="12207020">That's the test that the Board has been using.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.829" offset="12219246">Now, that bill was passed by the Senate but never acted upon by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.864" offset="12247353">And if we can consider therefore what Congress did in light of the action that the Board has been taking, we can say that Congress, by failing to amend the Taft-Hartley Act, has therefore acquiesced in the determination that the Board has made with respect to the interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.520" offset="13534041">And I say that that does not make Mr. Taylor, even under the company's designation of his duties, an officer of the CIO.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3400.530" offset="13602064">He was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.970" offset="13607811">Now, I read carefully the record, every page of it and the record doesn't show that he had anything to do with the organization of these particular employees at Coca-Cola.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.461" offset="13657757">And this leads me to the conclusion that the only purpose of injecting this issue into this case is the delay, the disposition of the unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.401" offset="13717525">Now, what we are concerned about, Your Honor, not only as a CIO because the effect of a decision under the Highland Park case of holding that Taylor was an officer and did not comply, would be to throw into jeopardy all of our representation cases and all of our unfair labor practice cases but the effect of this now that we have a combined labor movement is to take a man who was the staff man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.788" offset="13831105">And because of the failure of obviously a staff man, they are not an official of the union, it would be to jeopardize the compliance status not only of the CIO and that's not so important because we're not a union and here we go back to the Highland Park case where, unfortunately, we did not argue but we would have tried to argue that we're not a union, we're a federation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.301" offset="13933192">But the AF of L-CIO, which is much larger, is to throw into jeopardy the compliance status of all of our international unions that are -- are affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.042" offset="13976137">And there are -- because there are regional directors of the AF of L too and of the AF of L-CIO, some -- and that would encompass some 130 or 140 international unions and several thousand local unions affiliated with the international unions, and that creates our grave concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.823" offset="14051265">I'd like to point out something else to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.635" offset="14062446">The company gives a statement of what they indicate in their brief on a basis of an article that they read from the CIO news, which was reprinted in a -- in a book, indicates what a Regional Director does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.828" offset="14135275">It's on page 56 and 57 of the company's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.987" offset="14155860">Now, I ask Your Honors to read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.610" offset="14170384">And I say to Your Honors that the company's own description of what a Regional Director does doesn't make a Regional Director an officer of the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.932" offset="14219703">That makes him a functionary, that makes him a staff man and I would be the first to admit as counsel that a functionary, in this -- in my own case a legal functionary, exercises important functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.972" offset="14283860">I would hope that I do but I would be the first to admit to this Court that I'm not an officer of the CIO and I have not yet been advised by Mr. (Inaudible) that I'm an officer of the AF of L-CIO and I don't think I ever will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.266" offset="14353032">I may be advised that I am one of the counsel for the AF of L-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.207" offset="14380826">Now, I -- I think that's important to know that because I think what is basic here is an attempt to say that an important staff functionary is an officer of a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.678" offset="14442684">That's not what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.226" offset="14452820">Now, there's another important thing which I think the Court ought to know, which is found in the Board's decision in this case on the record on page 530A and 531A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.910" offset="14519589">The constitution of the CIO has never been changed, was never changed from before the Taft-Hartley Act until now in reference to the functions of a Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.340" offset="14577267">In fact, this officer, this so-called important officer was never mentioned in the CIO constitution, he's never mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.109" offset="14624392">The facts are that the number of these people was summarily changed by decision of the officers from the time of this case in 1951 until 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.327" offset="14681234">There were some 40 Regional Directors in 1951 and in 1953, it was decided by the officers that there ought to be 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.196" offset="14724702">Now, I ask the Court this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.138" offset="14732539">What kind of an officer is it that you ought to concern yourself with to determine whether there is compliance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.169" offset="14760647">What kind of an officer is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.342" offset="14769319">When the officers of the organization, by a summary decision without reference to the electorate, without reference to conventions, the supreme body can decide, “Well, there are too many of you, we'll send you away, we'll dismiss you, we'll assign you to other jobs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.932" offset="14843716">What kind of an office is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.190" offset="14852702">And I undertake the proposition that that is no office at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.012" offset="14867958">And finally, Your Honor, I would like to conclude with one final thought and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.018" offset="14896065">That if it is permitted, to mitigate the employment status of Mr. Taylor in this type of proceeding, if it's permitted, there'll never be an end to Labor Board proceedings and this is our concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.732" offset="14966909">It is our concern because there doesn't seem to be an end even at the present time without this problem being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.433" offset="15001704">This case, the complaint was filed in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.176" offset="15020617">It is now 1956 and if we determine in the unfair labor practice proceeding or in Board proceeding, what every functionary did as the Sixth Circuit indicates in its decision, we would never get through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.457" offset="15093760">And I would say this that neither the Board nor the respondent seems to understand what a labor federation is but the Board unfortunately in its case -- in its brief says that the CIO is affiliated with 17 international unions and 88 local unions in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.411" offset="15165544">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.677" offset="15174635">We have certainly international unions affiliated with the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.098" offset="15196369">CIO is not affiliated with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3860.608" offset="15442338">As already stated in this case, the respondent did not attack the union's compliance in a collateral administrative proceeding but sought to raise the subject at the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.763" offset="15491030">In conformance with the Board's rule set forth above, the trial examiner properly refused to hear evidence thereon and properly denied the respondent's motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.260" offset="15533035">Moreover, had the respondent proceeded by an appropriate motion to the Board and had the respondent established in a collateral proceeding what it had offered to prove at the hearing herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.225" offset="15588833">We're satisfied and find that under the Board's present constitutional test, such proof would fall short of substantiating the respondent's contention that Taylor was an officer of the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.641" offset="15638465">Under the Board's constitutional test, an officer is a person occupying a position identified as an officer in a union's constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.670" offset="15682664">And it does not appear that Taylor is a person occupying such a position in the current CIO constitution nor does it appear, as the respondent states in its brief, that the position of Taylor, position which Taylor occupies was omitted from the CIO's constitution in order to evade or circumvent the filing of the requirements of Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.200" offset="15776705">It follows, Your Honors, that the sole purpose for inquiring into evasion is -- has an office then omitted from the constitution of a union since 1947, the effective date of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.244" offset="15868970">And that is indicated by the continuing language used by the Board in its opinion at 531A, an examination of the constitutions of the CIO for the years 1946 through 1953 inclusive which covers a period both preceding and following the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act shows that Taylor's position was never designated as a CIO officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.044" offset="15984118">Accordingly, we reaffirmed the Board's determination made in an earlier representation case involving similar issues raised by the respondent because there was a representation case involving the same two parties for the same issues in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.463" offset="16053812">And now hold that the CIO is in compliance and that the respondent's contentions with respect to the matters -- matters made in this case lack merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.943" offset="16095713">So, in the collateral proceeding and not just any -- the Board following and ruling without exception, we would have been wasting our time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.202" offset="16160705">Now, what we did do and I'm must amplify Mr. Findling's statement somewhat as to what we did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.282" offset="16197068">When the complaint issued, the respondent moved to dismiss it on the ground that it did not affirmly duly allege, one, that the local union, the international union and three of the CIO or -- or at all relevant times or in -- or/and at all irrelevant times were in compliance with Section 9 (f), (g), and (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.215" offset="16288810">The motion also alleged his grounds for dismissing the complaint, the copies of all the compliance documents were relating to Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h) had not been filed as a part of the record in the case and furnished to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.591" offset="16342309">When the motion to dismiss the complaint was denied, the respondent filed an answer alleging that neither Local 20 nor the international union nor the CIO had filed or now have on file with the Secretary of Labor of the United States any and all of the documents, statements, material and data required for this subsection (f) and (g) of Section 9 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.984" offset="16443873">And at each of the respective officers of said organizations including W.B. Taylor, Regional Director of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in Kentucky has not executed and filed with the National Labor Relations Board and does not now have on file with the said Board, the affidavits required by subsection (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.630" offset="16534465">And this answer went on to assert that the respondent is entitled to inspect and examine et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.928" offset="16559647">Next to 1952, respondent -- counsel for respondent appeared at the Board office and asked to examine the compliance filed through the three unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.008" offset="16603951">Respondent's counsel then wrote to the general counsel of the Board requesting detailed information as to compliance for the three labor organizations with the three sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.060" offset="16648150">And in reply, the Board furnished the respondent with the list of the names of the officers of the three organizations who had filed the non-Communist affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.228" offset="16688901">Next, respondent secured subpoenas directed to the Chairman of the Board and to its Regional Director, requiring them to produce the non-Communist affidavits filed by the officers of the organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.135" offset="16740519">He likewise issued a subpoena to the Secretary of Labor, requiring him to produce the compliance doctrine that was filed by the three unions under Section 9 (f) -- 9 (f) and (g) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.130" offset="16788480">These subpoenas were subsequently revoked by the trial examiner on the ground that the company was not entitled to litigate the union's compliance in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.130" offset="16836441">So, I believe gentlemen that we reasonably well exhausted any remedy that we might have had with the N.L.R.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.136" offset="16880536">And finally, we turn to the question of our right to here litigate the question of a union's compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.902" offset="16923585">And I refer to the legal question of a union's compliance and not to the factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.863" offset="16959425">We believe that the Highland Park case settled the question that judicial review may be had as to whether and -- or not a union is required to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.534" offset="17014073">We believe that this case turns upon two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.571" offset="17034240">One, a definition of the term "officer" as used in Section 9 (h) of the Act and two, upon the so-called constitutional test as practiced by and promulgated by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.331" offset="17149283">To consider one of these questions is substantially to consider the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.198" offset="17176764">And first, I would like to come to what I believe is a conclusive or if not conclusive, at least a very enlightening approach to the term "officer."</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.220" offset="17256803">It is true that we are construing here a statute, not an intention of Congress because that's a little difficult to do but we may look -- we may look to the expressions of Congress as for some help along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.280" offset="17353038">According to our findings and this appears substantially on pages 48 and 49 of the respondent's brief, the records of the discussions of members of Congress while Section 9 (h) was in the process of passage indicate that the term "officer" was not very understood in any narrow or technical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.241" offset="17444885">The keynote of Section 9 (h) was named -- was aimed at Communist leadership and to prevent Communist domination in unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.814" offset="17511236">Congressmen, in referring to the persons to whom Section 9 (h) would apply, used the term "leader" either alone or interchangeably with the word "officers."</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.524" offset="17558047">Representative Bell stated that Communist must be -- must have -- that Communist have gotten into positions of authority and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.046" offset="17608098">And he sought to prevent against the impending danger of having Communist in control of our great American labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.161" offset="17648640">Congressman Halleck spoke of what is now Section 9 as a provision seeking to deal with a matter of Communist domination and leadership in unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.401" offset="17701512">So far as we have been able to determine, there is not one instance where any member of Congress expressly indicated that the term "officer" was to be defined by reference to a union's constitution and indeed so far as we have been able to find, the use of the word "officer" in connection with Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act was seldom used by members of Congress.</text>
