            <text syncTime="12.692" offset="50678">In the few remaining minutes we have left, counsel for petitioner will attempt to put three questions before the Court and if possible answer those questions to the satisfaction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.859" offset="115357">Question number one, did petitioner in fact have effective counsel in time for him to comply with Article 202 as interpreted in the Wilson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.613" offset="182439">Your Honors, we submit that when Mr. Schreiber was told by Judge Hertz that you are appointed as of this day, March the 2nd, of which was the day the grand jury term ended and he was further told by Judge Hertz that other counsel will be appointed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.901" offset="307513">Mr. Schreiber did not know at that time whether he would be the chief counsel or whether other counsels, whether it would be one or more, would be in charge of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.926" offset="355683">As it turned out, I was appointed on March the 6th which was the fourth judicial day following the expiration of the grand jury term.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.138" offset="432483">It's uncontradicted, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.240" offset="444918">At that time Judge Hertz told me he was appointing me to assist Mr. Schreiber and that I should get in touch with Mr. Schreiber.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.115" offset="484415">That he would not send the usual notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.051" offset="500193">I immediately attempted to get in touch with Mr. Schreiber but did not succeed in doing so and instead I called upon the defendant who was in the Parish prison at the time and for the first time learned the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.998" offset="571977">Early the next morning, which was a Saturday, I succeeded in getting in touch with Mr. Schreiber.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.499" offset="597995">And for the first time, he and I had an opportunity to discuss the facts of this matter and we decided to file this motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.258" offset="636970">And it was filed Monday morning before arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.878" offset="659435">And we think that it was timely filed, especially it was timely filed if we were to consider the Article 202 as it had been considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court for many, many years prior to the decision in the Wilson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.712" offset="746789">Because prior to the Wilson case, they had five articles which dealt with objecting to indictments by grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.447" offset="797780">Article 202 is only one of those five articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.248" offset="812931">Articles 284, 285, 286 and 287 of the Criminal Code were the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.329" offset="837277">Under Article 202, if a person was indicted by a grand jury within the first three days of its term and had counsel then it was incumbent upon him to file any objections to that grand jury before the expiration of the third judicial day of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.381" offset="929437">That was counting from beginning of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.423" offset="941662">If a person was indicted by the grand jury at anytime after the grand jury's third day, by then you have these other articles which provided that any objections to the grand jury, because they only dealt with indictments, these other Articles 284, 285, 286 and 287 report to grand juries only, not to petit juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.024" offset="1064020">Any objections to the grand jury must be urged in a motion to quash, must be pleaded before the arraignment, which we did in this case, and must be pleaded, filed and the heard, before the trial in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.410" offset="1149597">Now, what happens under the interpretation given to Article 202 in the Wilson case?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.419" offset="1181675">Your Honors, it renders these other articles dealing with indictments by a grand jury, Articles 284, 285, 286 and 287 useless, useless in any instance where the State wants to take advantage of a late appointment.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.010" offset="1280000">They're still in effect, very much so, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.281" offset="1317094">Even now, if a judge of any our sections of the Criminal District Court was to appoint a lawyer in the last couple of days following the expiration of the grand jury's term.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.106" offset="1400372">First of all, as Mr. Schreiber pointed out, that lawyer may not know of his appointment until he gets his official notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.401" offset="1433600">When he gets that official notice, then he's got to take it upon himself to immediately find out about his case, about the facts and see whether he should file a motion to quash such as we filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.810" offset="1499220">We believe that the Supreme Court of Louisiana in interpreting Article 202 in the Wilson case actually was guilty of judicial legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.688" offset="1562749">We believe that the Supreme Court of Louisiana is beginning to doubt in its own mind the wisdom of its decision because we see in one of the -- of one of the latest cases to come before that Court, namely, the State of Louisiana versus Joseph Chianelli of which -- the copy of which opinion is the main part of the record by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.824" offset="1667239">And in the Chianelli case, Your Honors, the Supreme Court of Louisiana has this to say and we quote, "We conceive that this Court's interpretation of Article 202 in the Wilson case may have been somewhat strained.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.222" offset="1744875">We can see likewise that it might be considered by some to have been judicial legislation rather than judicial interpretation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="446.820" offset="1787193">Nevertheless, this Court's construction and interpretation of Article 202 in the Wilson case has been approved by this Court, the same Court in two recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.024" offset="1836095">And they name our case, the Michel case and the Labat case which Your Honors will also have argued before you.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.034" offset="2060121">"We are conscious of the fact that under the -- the interpretation given to Article 202 by the Wilson case and others following it, an accused can indefinitely -- can indefinitely delay the trial of his case by waiting until the date fixed for trial to object to the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.845" offset="2143295">This case incidentally concerns the petit jury and I have one more remark to state about this case after I finish here.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.323" offset="2185195">However, to avoid these unnecessary delays, Article 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires legislative, not judicial action but the legislature in amending this article should be careful not to incorporate it -- in it any provision that would subject the statute to an attack on the ground of denial of due process -- process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.595" offset="2286341">Actually, if Article 202 is correctly interpreted, the intent of the legislature would have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.909" offset="2319569">Article 202 is enacted to cover both grand juries and petit juries, and if you interpret Article 202 to mean the first three days of the jury's term, right then it would do exactly what the legislature wanted it to do, have all attacks against petit juries urged before the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.471" offset="3793816">I want to clarify first the State's position in the Chianelli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.859" offset="3811370">In the Chianelli case there was an attack upon the petit jury, not the grand jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.154" offset="3848568">Now, the Wilson case, of course, didn't deal with the petit jury -- jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.200" offset="3864764">It dealt with the grand jury only.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.888" offset="3875527">So that the State's position was that 202 could be applied as written to a petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.298" offset="3905097">Wilson held that it could not be applied to a grand jury because if it did, if it were applied that way then it would be unconstitutional and that it would not allow a reasonable period or the raising of federal points.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.130" offset="3964447">I won't say therefore that the State did not abandon its position in -- in Chianelli at all with reference to the Wilson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.730" offset="4002900">We regard it as a different situation altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.984" offset="4015856">That it is possible to raise, to -- to say that 202 applies to petit juries three days after the beginning of the term because a man knows he's coming up in that time and has an opportunity, as a matter of fact, to raise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.565" offset="4078237">The Supreme Court took position and we disagreed with it that Wilson should be -- that the language in 202 should be applied to both petit and -- and grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.890" offset="4135497">So that while they disagreed with us, they affirmed action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.525" offset="4150021">Now, on the Wilson case as recently as the Chianelli case and all of us know in the Chianelli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.933" offset="4171651">I would like to make this point which I intend to make a bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.410" offset="4189623">And that is the meticulous concern of Louisiana and its Supreme Court for the protection of federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.415" offset="4217626">You recall that Mr. Fust, a moment ago, read a language from the Chianelli case wherein the Supreme Court, going out of its way, said, "Well now, if we are wrong about 202 as to petit juries and grand juries, it's up to the legislature to do that but we want to make the caveat that they better be careful to protect federal constitutional rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.395" offset="4297561">I think it's important because part of the argument made in this case and in the next case, principally, has to do with the idea that Louisiana in Wilson was developing a sinister and anti-federal doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.353" offset="4361404">A doctrine that was intended as a mechanism to prevent the raising of federal rights and we contend that it -- exactly the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.092" offset="4408320">That had as a matter of fact, the Louisiana Supreme Court not interpreted 202 to apply up to three days at the end of the term, then they would have found our statute precisely in the position of the statute in Texas which this Court declared unconstitutional some 40 years ago, Carter versus Texas, because it didn't allow an opportunity for a person who had been indicted after the three days of the -- the commencement of the term to raise the point, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.793" offset="4519079">Whereas, Louisiana's interpretation of 202 allows every person at least three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.622" offset="4542485">And in many instances, of course, far more because if a person, let's say were indicted today in November by a grand jury whose term would expire on March that person will have until three days after the end of the term in March to raise that point which I submit to the Court is longer than exists in many States who cut off the right to raise pleas at the arraignment part.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.528" offset="7350021">Now, the point has been made incidentally and I refer again to the record on page 47, the Supreme Court of Louisiana had no doubt about this question as a matter of fact at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.311" offset="7393176">If the Court would look at the bottom page of 47, the Court of Louisiana says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.554" offset="7414178">The counsel insists that the statute as interpreted as unfair and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.445" offset="7429747">There might have been some merit in this postulation if the predicate upon which it's based were valid,But the minutes of the Court show that appellant's chief counsel, chief if you noticed, Mr. Schreiber, an attorney of experience in criminal cases was appointed by the judge to represent him on March 2nd, 1953 (not on March 5th as counsel contend).</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.193" offset="7516682">The judge of course, Judge Hertz, also said that in his per curiam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.074" offset="7532251">So that you've got the judge saying that in the testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.286" offset="14617078">Louisiana has a valid interest in seeing that these attacks upon grand juries are made early, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.057" offset="14640170">Because after all if we have to justify a grand jury presumably we have to call the grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.534" offset="14662113">And in months or years they're gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.297" offset="14669113">They're scattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.864" offset="14671412">That language is used in Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.912" offset="14679562">Then, of course, another part is that Louisiana is interested in correcting its errors as soon as it may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.552" offset="14702132">I don't believe that -- why, I know this Court has never held that a statute of limitation which is reasonable a -- a waiver system which is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.810" offset="14743197">And which, however, happens to cut off federal rights is thereby unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.049" offset="14760124">We state in our brief quite a number of cases on page -- page -- well, starting at page 15, Parker versus Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="3802.356" offset="15209326">He was brought to trial on a Thursday in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.750" offset="15222909">And this Court, I think it was Mr. Justice Black, who wrote the opinion, examined it carefully.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.927" offset="15307651">Now, our position is that if three days is enough, is a reasonable time to prepare for trial, then it certainly must be a reasonable trial time to file a motion which I want to parenthetically state is in fact a simple motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.177" offset="15368673">If this Court will look at the motion in the record, it's a -- it's a one page motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4804.515" offset="19217972">That's the only time it was ever invoked to my knowledge after 28 years of criminal law practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.441" offset="19249737">202 was only invoked for the first time in the Wilson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4833.740" offset="19334896">Now, in as far as the procedure which the different justices have asked counsel in Louisiana, we have a system in Louisiana of selecting grand juries and petit juries which does not -- is not the same as in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.066" offset="19420264">Now, up until the case of Pierre -- Pierre, there were no Negroes ever served on petit juries or grand juries in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.459" offset="19469793">It was the Pierre case which is the case that came from the 24th Judicial District Court of the State of Louisiana, the Parish of Jefferson, in which this Court forced the State of Louisiana to, at least, put the names of colored people on the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.832" offset="19567282">The State of Louisiana, never at any time, put a colored person on any jury, petit or grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.556" offset="19594136">And in the cases of Pierre versus State of Louisiana, this Court forced the State of Louisiana to put colored people on the petit juries.</text>
