            <text syncTime="21.381" offset="85473">This case if the Court please, involved the question of where the time spent by a knifeman in a meatpacking plant sharpening the knives that they use in their meat-cutting job is a part of a knifeman's principal activity rather than preliminary and postliminary under Section 4, the Portal Act, and whether it's still compensable despite the provision of the Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.921" offset="215667">The Tenth -- the Ninth Circuit held that it was -- there was non-compensable and was -- because it was preliminary and postliminary despite its recognition that it probably and might be anyway an indispensable to the performance of their productive work.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.349" offset="297378">The evidence shows indisputably and respondent doesn't dispute that the knives must be sharpened daily in order for them to be of any practical value in the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.262" offset="352967">As stated by one witness, they must be razor sharp and unless he had a sharp knife, he couldn't do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.464" offset="385776">I don't believe there's any serious question that the sharp knife is absolutely indispensable to be proper efficient or any adequate performance of the meat-cutting job.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.147" offset="460487">Some of the knives of -- mainly, the knives that -- theoretically, they are the employee's knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.502" offset="489953">He buys them, most of them from -- these are the smaller knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.794" offset="507089">He buys most of them and when I say small, I'm speaking relatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.869" offset="523389">To me, they look quite large.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.260" offset="529032">I don't know if they sent them up in the exhibit, but they were placed in exhibits in the record, but they are relatively smaller knives and they purchased most of them at cost from the company and the company furnishes them the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.222" offset="600816">I think they cost around a $1.5, $1.85 a piece on an average, but that by the time the employee puts all the time into sharpening and I'm going to show you sharpening them, I can assure you he pays a lot more for those knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.712" offset="678766">The -- they also sharpen some of the company knives, although there's no requirement that they sharpen the company knives on their own term if there is with respect to sharpening.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.164" offset="728607">They're so-called -- they're individual knives.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="191.513" offset="766015">No, the company knives that, Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, the larger knives and the more heavy equipment so that they all have their individual knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.100" offset="820349">They're -- they have them and they -- they sharpen their own knives, and the testimony is that they had individual taste and they prefer to sharpen their own knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.027" offset="872072">They -- this is done through use of an emery wheel and wet stones and various tools which the company does furnish the tool room and the tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.665" offset="914599">And the employees, although there is evidence that the employees were not required to use the company tools and room, the employees generally did use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.463" offset="961829">Most of them did not have that equipment for sharpening their own knives.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.755" offset="978965">Theoretically, too, the employees could take their knives home and sharpen them.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.914" offset="999654">That was a pure theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.282" offset="1005087">It was very rarely done and I think there were few occasions mentioned where the employee had some custom work and he took some knives home, but there were very good reasons why they wouldn't take them home from sharpening.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.400" offset="1065587">For one thing the knives could dull.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.969" offset="1071856">They have their edges dull just in the movement to and from the home to the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.135" offset="1104457">And also, it was somewhat dangerous to carry these knives around away from the plant and going into traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.688" offset="1138730">In addition to that, as one employee testified, it took -- would take as long to wrap it up to make it safe to carry it as it would, just stay and sharpen it almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.548" offset="1178122">It wasn't worth fooling with taking it home.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.415" offset="1189616">So, then, as a practical matter, they -- they could not do this sharpening work at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.750" offset="1222949">With the requirement that the knives be razor sharp, it had to be done immediately prior to the -- the assembly line work.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.513" offset="1278015">Now, the Tenth Circuit, I think, did not take issue with the fact that this is an indispensable and integral part of -- of meat-cutting work.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.299" offset="1341127">And I -- I don't understand that -- that respondent disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.690" offset="1366727">The Tenth -- the Ninth Circuit's reasoning was that anything before the scheduled work, any activity, preparatory activity before the scheduled workday or after the scheduled workday was preliminary -- a postliminary within the intent of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.886" offset="1447497">As I have already stated in -- in the argument of the preceding case, we think the terms of the statute despite Mr. Justice Frankfurter's objections, as well as the legislative history, plainly show that the Section 4 does not make the decisive consideration whether it's pre-shift or post-shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.343" offset="1553345">And I will continue with the legislative history because there is much more of that than we could argue I suppose forever on the -- on the terms of the statute on its face, but the legislative history where there is more opportunity to -- to state the intent in detail than there is on the face of the statute makes it clear beyond doubt that this type of activity was not intended to be made non-compensable whether it was performed before the work shift or after the work shift, as well as performed during the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.105" offset="1700362">The Senate Report gave two examples specifically of what was intended by principal activities, and those two examples we submit clearly indistinguishable from the knife-sharpening of the meat cutters.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.245" offset="1792940">The first example was the oiling, greasing and cleaning of machine by a lay operator.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.753" offset="1942988">And the -- in giving those examples, Senator Cooper later pointed out in explaining that on the floor of the Senate that those examples were -- showed very clearly that Congress was not excluding pre-shift and post-shift activity because both of those examples are obviously pre-shift and -- and post-shift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.598" offset="5206309">While we're on this subject, I must disagree with Ms. Margolin that these controversies arose from the Portal-to-Portal Act, certainly and most specifically in so far as the knife-sharpening problem that we are concerned with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.584" offset="5282273">This problem, this whole problem arose under the Wage and Hour Act, the Labor Standards Act before the Portal-to-Portal Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.220" offset="5324800">And this tool sharpening problem was involved in the Mount Clemens Pottery case, which this Court decided and which was the last of the three cases under the Wage and Hour law that clearly and undeniably resulted in Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.930" offset="5419677">And in the Mt. Clemens case, it seems to us that they -- that this Court made a holding which makes it perfectly clear if we're going to concern ourselves with questions of statutory construction that there is no merit in the Government's position here, and that what the Government is doing is seeking to ask this Court or is asking this Court to nullify the Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.402" offset="5541512">The Mt. Clemens case, if Your Honors please, was concern with preliminary activities such as we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.712" offset="5598772">It was concern with both travelling, walking on the company's premises, and it was concerned with preliminary activities such as the knife-sharpening, tool sharpening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.329" offset="5661257">And the question before the Court in the Mt. Clemens case was whether all these preliminary activity compensable under the law or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.124" offset="5716428">And the Court didn't hold that it was all compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.018" offset="5736072">You held only that part of it, namely, that that was necessary to the performance of the employees' main job was compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.726" offset="5798870">Well, it was that holding that resulted in the Portal Act, namely, the holding that only dispensable, I mean only indispensable, only necessary preliminary work is required to be compensated for under the old Wage and Hour law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.459" offset="5889776">It was that holding that Congress didn't like and that has caused Congress to enact this language, which has Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out, is so clear in eliminating the compensability of any preliminary activities.</text>
