            <text syncTime="6.968" offset="27794">Please.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.138" offset="32496">I've had the exceptional opportunity to being able to prepare my argument as an answer to the Court's questions which were opposed during yesterday's session.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.393" offset="73561">I will proceed through it rather rapidly because I'd like to leave sometime for further questions by the Court after my prepared presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.084" offset="116297">Before proceeding, however, to answer the several questions, I would like to point out that there's been a tremendous narrowing of the issue on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.846" offset="155376">Originally, it was argued by the Solicitor as he did in his brief that the grand jury is a powerful secret largely uncontrolled body whose indictment is not reviewable by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.565" offset="222250">This was based in part on Judge Hand's statement of 1910, that the grand jury was an irresponsible utterance of the community at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.563" offset="266240">But now, Judge Hand, in the opinion below and my adversaries, had recognized that on a proper showing, such as that the indictments based on new evidence or an indictment which is based on so-called the aggravated hearsay like a police officer testifying that someone told him that the indictee was the murderer, and those cases, the courts must set aside the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.441" offset="393718">In other words, the grand jury is like all other agencies, judicial and otherwise, provided for under the Constitution and they are governed by rules and it is not in an artistic body, thus, if a grand jury's indictment --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="114.237" offset="456934">You mean they're responsible not artistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.355" offset="465398">Those are very different concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.593" offset="474279">And Judge Hand, you -- you mean the word irresponsible and maybe not artistic.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.014" offset="555990">When he said irresponsible, he meant that that is for the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.049" offset="568111">It's a very different thing (Inaudible) and from the cabinet officer whose under particularly by a statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris Shilensky</label>
            <text syncTime="147.071" offset="588278">I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.232" offset="592875">If the grand jury's indictment is presumed to be a finding of probable cause, it is at least not conclusive as the Solicitor per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.043" offset="640104">Now, we then proceed to the question as to what showing a defendant must make in order to invoke the supervision of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.426" offset="685662">That leads me to Mr. Justice Reed's question as to whether we ask for the grand jury minutes during the trial, we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.342" offset="717322">At page 135 of Volume 1, at that time, the agent (Inaudible) was on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.784" offset="751073">He was the one agent who was in a position to testify to something which wasn't hearsay because he talked to the defendant in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.034" offset="788062">But he wasn't called before the grand jury and we didn't know it at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.974" offset="807811">And we said to the Court, look at the minutes, grand jury minutes and the Court during the recess said, after recess, I advice you that I have read the grand jury minutes and I state to you that I find no contradiction on the grand jury minutes with anything that this witness has said, no suggestion that the witness had not testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.156" offset="904568">The judge merely said, I read the minutes and there's no contradiction somewhat cue.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.969" offset="939781">Our counsel said, defendant's counsel said, "I offer to prove, Your Honor, that this witness was not before the grand jury and the courts that I declined to accept the offer because I think it's immaterial."</text>
            <text syncTime="247.126" offset="988473">And then counsel had ought to say, "I made a motion before I may explain to Your Honor in this case from inspection of the grand jury minutes on the ground that there was no competent evidence before this grand jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="257.386" offset="1029538">The Court said, "Was the motion decided?"</text>
            <text syncTime="258.865" offset="1035389">"Yes, I was refused the grand jury minutes."</text>
            <text syncTime="261.623" offset="1046465">Then your record is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.687" offset="1054720">Counsel persists that I expect to show during the course of this trial that there was no competent evidence before the grand jury from which this indictment is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.566" offset="1090247">And the Court said, "You have offered to do that, but I shall decline to accept the offer of proof, because it is not an issue before this jury, whether or not, the indictment was based on competent evidence before the grand jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="283.915" offset="1135595">Your motion which was denied summons the law on that as far as I'm concerned and your record is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.070" offset="1164225">Even then, of course, we didn't know that the witness of that testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.322" offset="1181257">Later, and we profess further, the Government conceded that that witness, the one agent who had interviewed the defendant had not testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.540" offset="1226083">Now, we moved at every stage of the case and every opportunity we have to urge that the grand jury have acted without legal basis but to no avail, and as Judge Hand said, at 153 of the record, the defendant had done all he could to raise the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.803" offset="1475187">At -- simultaneously, with that motion, the defendant asked for the grand jury minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.142" offset="5716532">And it's true the one witness testified they've been working on it for months, but they continued working on it afterwards and the figures of the trial differed widely from the figures of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.874" offset="5755402">And -- and therefore, I say, that there was much between the date of the indictment and the (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.944" offset="5859683">There's one other item and then just one sentence of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.326" offset="5873267">The expenditures of Mrs.Costello were $105,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.146" offset="5892493">There was no record connection between Mrs. Costello and Mr. Costello.Her expenditures were charged disavowed, he gave her the money without any records to show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.549" offset="5938155">But there was testimony at the trial of witnesses, the lawyer and a couple of other people of the Court whose testimony, the Government argued, entitled the jury to tie in that $105,000 to Mr. Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.866" offset="5995416">That couldn't be before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.196" offset="6000744">It would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.729" offset="6006909">Now, the concluding part is this, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.190" offset="6020702">If you had any misgivings about accepting Judge Hand's finding that there was only hearsay, the grand jury minutes, I suggest, should be ordered and filed in this Court so it could be printed and become a part of this record, and then we could see whether it is as Judge Hand found for a hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.644" offset="6114534">Now, whether it's competent to support the indictment or as you did in the Remmer case and on another occasions, you send it back to the Court and say, "Look at these minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.711" offset="6150792">Report Are these minutes hearsay?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.897" offset="6163540">Or is it of such great value of evidence that we were not going to disturb it, as of -- stands down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.588" offset="6190289">This case stands for the principle that hearsay evidence by agents who are charged with seeking an indictment, it's their duty, unsupported by any facts, may support an indictment and the constitutional provision for an indictment is no protection at all.</text>
