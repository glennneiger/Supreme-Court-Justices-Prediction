          <turn speaker="eugene_b_schwartz" startTime="33.850" stopTime="636.249">
            <label>Mr. Eugene B. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="33.850" offset="135314">If it please the Court, I find myself in the position of addressing this Court on an issue as to which -- much are many of the collateral legal matters have already been discussed by counsel in the two previous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.502" offset="198008">I think it is unfortunate that the Sixth Circuit did not favor us with a written opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.096" offset="220369">Each judge in one entry refers only to the LeTourneau is supporting the Board's decision and the two Sixth Circuit decisions, to wit, the Lake Superior Lumber Company and Monarch Machine Tool Company, both of which were decided primarily on the basis of LeTourneau and Republic Aviation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.093" offset="300304">Now, I think Mr. Manoli is to be credited for his frankness yesterday in admitting that LeTourneau has a difference -- the difference between LaTourneau in this case and the two preceding cases lies in the fact that LeTourneau expressly involved only employees and not nonemployees.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.991" offset="371879">We have quoted in our brief the quotation, the footnote from the Board's brief in LeTourneau before this Court where the Board expressly said, “We did not consider and the matter is not before this Court now as to what would happen if nonemployees sought to come on to the parking lot.”</text>
            <text syncTime="111.988" offset="447948">Yet, for all practical purposes, both by a brief and oral argument and by decision, the Board has in effect held that LeTourneau decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.822" offset="491207">I want to call the attention to just one unusual feature which is developed since yesterday and that is that there were four cases decided by the Board within the period of a three-and-a-half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.020" offset="536033">Monsanto Chemical Company was decided by the Board in 108 N.L.R.B. in May of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.131" offset="564454">Then, Seamprufe was decided by the Board the following month, the 109 N.L.R.B., Babcock and Wilcox, 109 N.L.R.B., Ranco 109 N.L.R.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.878" offset="607504">I am here for Ranco only.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.341" offset="617326">You would suppose that with four cases decided within a period of three-and-a-half months on the same basic issue, there would be some reference in the fourth case, Ranco, to the three preceding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.547" offset="666122">But the fact is that in none of the cases which followed Monsanto, that was the first decided in May of 1954, is there any reference to any of the preceding cases, and I think the reason is quite evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.821" offset="719203">I think the Board adopted what we back in Cleveland called a (Inaudible) technique or the rubber stamp technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.623" offset="746475">Here is the parking lot situation of plant in the outskirts of a town that's LeTourneau.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.085" offset="772284">Look at the -- I have an opportunity to look at the record in Monsanto Chemical which is still pending on the docket of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.053" offset="804153">Incidentally, this is the first case decided but it's still pending and I think the result -- that resulted from the fact that the Ninth Circuit leaved it to Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.491" offset="833933">It seems to be quite behind in its docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.074" offset="844278">In any event, if you look at record 18 and 19 of the Monsanto record, you will find that the Board in Monsanto said that LeTourneau is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.924" offset="887641">That was the argument that was made in Monsanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.309" offset="897149">LeTourneau was dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.978" offset="903837">Of course, LeTourneau related to employees and Monsanto involved nonemployees.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.941" offset="923690">What happened in Seamprufe?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.857" offset="931422">I think Mr. -- I paraphrase Mr. Mueller when I say that in Seamprufe, the Board said the difference between an employee and a nonemployee as far as we're concerned in applying LeTourneau is a distinction without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.837" offset="987324">Babcock and Wilcox, I do not have the benefit of their record which incidentally made it somewhat difficult for us to understand the Board's brief because the Board basically just said, here's the copy of Babcock and Wilcox's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.267" offset="1037061">You can read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.341" offset="1041345">Reading a -- reading a brief without a record is somewhat difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.950" offset="1059736">Here's what the Board found in our case, in record 108 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="269.504" offset="1077917">The test laid down in LeTourneau and since adhered to is whether the prohibition of distribution of union literature places an unreasonable impediment on the freedom of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.061" offset="1116160">Well, of course, that isn't what LeTourneau decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.672" offset="1126609">It decided that the prohibition of distribution of literature by employees had settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.464" offset="1153776">Then, what did the Board say in its expertness?</text>
            <text syncTime="292.565" offset="1170181">You go along the pages so after quoting LeTourneau and the result reached is the same though the distribution is sought to be made by outside organizers rather than by plant employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.294" offset="1213127">Where does that come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.702" offset="1218769">Remington Rand Company, 103 N.L.R.B., Number 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.636" offset="1234442">And what's the support in Remington Rand?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.322" offset="1241234">Nothing more than the blank it state.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.206" offset="1248758">The Board assumes and the Board has assumed by dictum in effect, provided by it that when this Court decided LeTourneau, it decided all parking lot cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.618" offset="1298390">Now, if it please the Court, I would be remising my obligation to this Court and to my client if I did not discuss the evidentiary fact as found by the Board in this case and I do want to state that we do not have any conflict of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.574" offset="1354292">The Board's brief here on page 2 in our brief called the attention to the fact that no conflict exist on evidentiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.427" offset="1381669">We are fortunate in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.116" offset="1392431">It's always this tasteful to be arguing about facts particularly to a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.474" offset="1413851">But we start with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.017" offset="1423987">The UAW-CIO, well, I'd come back for a little moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.760" offset="1443004">Here's a company that has five plants in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.076" offset="1460245">All of these facts are found by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.537" offset="1466096">I have the documentation if anyone should desire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.652" offset="1482606">The company has five plants in the State of Ohio, three in the City of Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.307" offset="1501205">Those three plants are under contract with the Machinist Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.589" offset="1518341">Then, it has a plant all from plain cities, some 24 or 25 miles northwest on Route 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.773" offset="1543001">And it also has another plant in Delaware, Ohio, the home of Ohio Wesleyan University, and that's the plant that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.760" offset="1571004">That's also on Route 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.798" offset="1579154">Route 42 is the highway between Cleveland and Cincinnati and passes to the west of Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.288" offset="1609143">The company built the plant in Delaware in 1948 and in 1950, it found it necessary to adopt the rule, to adopt the rule with respect to distribution of union literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.981" offset="1675912">And it had before it, the benefit of this Court's decision in LeTourneau.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.986" offset="1691899">It had before the benefit of this Court's decision in Republic Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.839" offset="1707259">It had before it the Court's -- the Board's decision in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="431.339" offset="1725336">And adding them up, it was quite evident that it did have the right to -- to prohibit the distribution of literature within its plant at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.925" offset="1755638">That's (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="440.822" offset="1763265">Under the circumstances here, it felt that it did not have the right to prohibit the distribution by employees of literature on its parking lot or outside its premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.335" offset="1805270">So it adopted a rule which went beyond LeTourneau.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.205" offset="1816764">It adopted a rule which went beyond Republic Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.117" offset="1832438">It adopted a rule in effect which says this, it's general counsel's Exhibit 2 and Record 14 (a) and I better had not -- I better not misquote it, “Delaware plant employees are permitted to distribute literature on company property but not on company time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="474.606" offset="1898371">So you see they went whole hog.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.838" offset="1907252">They permit the employees to distribute on company property which is both within and outside the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.207" offset="1932748">Any such distribution must be done in such a manner that the plant buildings will not become littered.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.432" offset="1961691">Further, what did the Board find?</text>
            <text syncTime="492.835" offset="1971304">The Board find that -- it found that the employees availed themselves of that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.911" offset="1991576">At 104 (a) of the record, the Board found that the -- the petitioner, I'll thought of Ranco because we were the respondent in the court below, uniformly permitted employees to distribute literature of the guardhouse gates between the plant and the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.658" offset="2050612">Both union and anti-union literature has been passed out there by employees without hindrance from Ranco.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.096" offset="2080287">What happened inside the plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="522.441" offset="2089691">And I might state that trial counsel has always at an advantage over counsel that comes in later because you can visualize some of these things better.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.221" offset="2124800">Within the plant, we freely permitted employees to wear large CIO buttons while at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.726" offset="2146847">A sample of one is an evidence that respondent's Exhibit 3, unfortunately, they take a picture of this button, but respondent's Exhibit B is a large button both join UAW-CIO organizing committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.905" offset="2219572">Their employees exercising the rights which they have under the Act, democracy in action, and then they permit them to wear t-shirts bearing the CIO emblem and, unfortunately, for the purpose of not encumbering the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.972" offset="2275788">We did not put one in evidence but it was described as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.258" offset="2293029">The t-shirt, on which appears in blue about six inches in diameter, the emblem of the international union, UAW-CIO, and above which -- which appears in red in letters varying from one to two inches in size both and below which appears in red in letters varying from a half-inch to one-inch in size and the words UAW-CIO and employees wore those t-shirts in the plant without hindrance and the Board so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.134" offset="2392503">And if you can visualize a plant, that of some 700 people on two or three shifts with man running around with those t-shirts, you will realize that we have walking billboards in our plant and that's all right with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.998" offset="2439941">We say yes to the employees, “You have the right to do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="613.152" offset="2452584">No hindrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.531" offset="2462093">All of these facts add up to full and open recognition by this employer of its employees' rights to self-organization as guaranteed to them by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.206" offset="2504725">The sum total of its actions, evidence to its employees of anything included that they were free to engage and they did engage in organizational activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.255" offset="3180983">The charge said that the employer denied the UAW-CIO, the right to distribute literature on the employers premises at a location which was the only location at which the representatives of the union could effectively distributes its literature as said employee left the premises of said employer, although, said employer permitted the distribution of anti-union literature at said location on its premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.185" offset="3272725">In other words, the union originally charged us for discrimination which would be a different case.But the Board after investigation did not charge us with discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.218" offset="3308774">The Board after investigation and it's at paragraphs 5 and 6 of its complaint at page 6 (a), in effect charged us with denying, and I want to emphasize this, with preventing the union and its agents and representatives, and they finally explained that they meant nonemployee agents and representatives because obviously the employees were also agents and representatives, preventing the representatives from circulating or distributing among the employees of said plant in the parking lot and elsewhere on respondent's premises pamphlets, literature and other written or printed material.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.191" offset="3452761">Now, I emphasize, they were -- we were charged and tried with only one thing preventing nonemployee organizers from distributing pamphlets, literature and other rented, written or printed material.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.294" offset="3509081">Note that at no time were we charged with denying them a forum for discussion and arena, a spot and which they could answer questions and interchange ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.288" offset="3549100">We were not charge with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.478" offset="3553907">We were not tried with that but we will come later to a point which will show that the Board basically based its decision not on the ostensible reasons but on the lack of opportunity in the union to corral our employees whether or not they desire to be corralled and to talk to them to convince them with or against their will of the benefits of union organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.131" offset="3916487">That's his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.864" offset="3919412">That's a job of an international representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.624" offset="3926413">He so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.837" offset="3935295">He issues a circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.047" offset="3940101">The first circular is issued of January 22nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.336" offset="3953267">That's in evidence, general counsel's Exhibit 6 of page 18 (a) and it was distributed at the fence gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.237" offset="3976882">There's nothing in the record to show how many copies were distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.256" offset="3989002">The only thing in the record is that at the fence gates, and I'll come to that in just a moment, he and two other union representatives distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.465" offset="4021812">Now, let's visualize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.227" offset="4028813">Here's a road, U.S. Route 42, a very heavily traveled thoroughfare, which passes through Delaware, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.020" offset="4055980">Delaware is a town of some 12,000 people, the home of Ohio Wesleyan as I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.704" offset="4078759">It has offices and the union had an office from the very start, the union had a telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.271" offset="4097045">The union, according to its own circulars, had Eagles Hall which apparently was large enough so they invited the employees and their sweethearts and their wives, so the union had all these facilities available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.155" offset="4136542">This was not in the wilderness somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.561" offset="4146155">Ranco's plant is right within the -- right within the city limits, 1.7 miles I believe from the -- from the heart of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.951" offset="4179801">The speed limit of that point on Route 42 is 35 miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.412" offset="4197564">The record shows that it's heavily traveled and heavily pleased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.181" offset="4212715">There's a 34th area between the roadway itself and the fence which encloses the Ranco property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.031" offset="4244062">That 30-foot roadway is public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.007" offset="4255974">Employees entering the plant must stop and employees leaving the plant must stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.994" offset="4279902">There's been so much mentioned about non-stop with respect to these other cases and I -- I must point out the fact that the Board found in this case on the basis of the union representative's testimony that at least 90% of the car stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.992" offset="4331938">The Board also found on the testimony only of this union representative that in the wintertime, he also complained because some of the cars that stopped didn't open up their windows so he could give them literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.507" offset="4378018">Well, I -- I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.958" offset="4383765">I, as an employee, have to open up my window to get literature if I don't want it but let's put that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.557" offset="4406126">He testified that in the wintertime, 50% of the cars did stop to receive literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.796" offset="4431099">And in the summertime, 75% of the cars did stop and accepted literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.967" offset="4451788">So I think he did a pretty good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.847" offset="4463386">And was this on one occasional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.359" offset="4469342">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.146" offset="4472581">It was on 25 different occasions between January 22nd, 1953 in October when we tried the case over there in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.224" offset="4504869">On 25 different occasions, but after the first occasion when he issued literature, he writes us and says, “We request permission to distribute literature on your company property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.808" offset="4551158">Now -- and I will not go in to the nature of the literature although that would be something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.779" offset="4583027">I've also adverted to the fact that the union maintained an office in the telephone in Delaware and that the Eagles Hall was available to it and was used by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.601" offset="4618344">Now, I might mention because someone has mentioned something about Jehovah's Witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.113" offset="4636421">The decision in Martin versus Struthers apparently gives a member of Jehovah's Witnesses the right to -- oh, to knock on my door, but it also preserves for me the right to slam my door in his face and not to take his message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.198" offset="4692741">And the law, which now provides that the employee has a right to engage in concerted activities and the right to refrain from such activities also gives the employee the right to say, “I don't want to open my window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.930" offset="4735687">I don't want to read that trash.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.442" offset="4741747">And I say that because there is some of the evidence in the record that employees considered it trash and were highly incensed and that is in the record at some of the statements made about them as well as against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.043" offset="4792111">So we find that on 25 different occasions with 90% of the cars stopping, a physical situation under which we enforced and the state police enforced stop rules not out in the country and so this brings or somewhere else but right in a busy city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.641" offset="4854491">The union representatives have opportunity on 25 occasions and the employees themselves on seven or eight occasions distribute union literature, other employees distributing nine union literatures within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.058" offset="4900153">Well, the Board then and again without any reference to anything except LeTourneau says, “Well, there's unreasonable difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.816" offset="4927216">There's (Inaudible) technique as I call it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.637" offset="4938501">What's the real reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.061" offset="4944144">I've have been scouting that and I think I finally find it not only in the briefs but in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.621" offset="4962429">What were these difficulties?</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.776" offset="4971102">Well, the so-called difficulty, Your Honor, if it is important, was not in distributing literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.644" offset="4998478">That was on freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.989" offset="5003912">That was done openly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.320" offset="5009241">And remember, there's no background of any espionage, threats or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.186" offset="5024705">We have the walking billboards and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.698" offset="5034736">The difficulty of the union representative here and it appears in the Board's findings and appears in the argument here was in getting employees who might not want to accept union literature to open their doors or to be stop somewhere so that union literature could be given to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.038" offset="5088131">The difficulty was in getting those employees to discuss with the union representatives, to discuss only not to distribute union literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.059" offset="5124180">There is a significant comment in the Board's brief in this case at page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.311" offset="5141211">The Board's brief in this Court at page 11, and I stressed that, placed down the effectiveness of the distribution of literature by the nonemployees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.451" offset="5173708">It placed down the distribution of literature by the employees and then, here's what it says, “Moreover and more important, although fellow employees may pinch it to distribute literature, the employees generally are deprived of ready access to union representatives.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.440" offset="5245701">And as we have indicated in our brief in number 250, that Babcock &amp; Wilcox, these representatives are by virtue of their training and background full time -- full time specialist constituting the employees best source of information about unionism and that is basically what Brother Manoli mentioned here in the closing of his argument, that when you -- you distribute literature to someone, it evokes questions and then you have an opportunity for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.269" offset="5353012">But remember the very narrow issue that -- on which we were tried, the very narrow complaint issued against us that we were preventing them from distributing pamphlets, circulars and other rented, written and printed literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.700" offset="5406720">Insofar as this case is concerned, the expertness of the man who -- who draws or designs that circular and there were cartoons and everything else is completely immaterial, assuming that it takes expertness and training for full time men to write circulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.019" offset="5472026">The only question here is where can they distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.636" offset="5482475">Shall -- shall we have imposed upon us the -- the duty to make them or let them distribute at locations other than those -- the locations where they have so effectively distributed in the past?</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.368" offset="5525420">And I questioned very frankly, if it please the Court, whether -- whether even the Government here who contend that it takes full time specialist to distribute in hand out literature, it may take full time specialist to do that which the Board now seeks to make us do and that upon which we were not tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.572" offset="5598250">If that allegation had been intended, it should have been -- it should have been issued against us.We should have tried that case and we would have been able to argue that case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.241" offset="5636911">Now, what's the effect of the ruling here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.552" offset="5646106">The effect of the ruling is that we must help the union organize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.427" offset="5657704">You can't get beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.643" offset="5666482">The most effective, I believe, is a phrase that was used yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.312" offset="5685185">I took rather copious notes and I hope I was not disobeying any rule of court and being so busy and taking notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.995" offset="5715905">The phrase yesterday was used frequently that the most logical place, the most reasonable place and the most effective place in which to distribute literature is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.942" offset="5755716">Yes, I will agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.042" offset="5764075">The most effective place possibly in which to sell insurance is at meeting of doctors or of lawyers and yet, no one says that an insurance man for that reason has to be given that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.351" offset="5809319">It's nice to have things made easy for you but by the same token.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.410" offset="5825620">We have no right to tell our employees, each of our employees, "Look, you must open your window when you get to that -- when you get to that stop sign so the union representative can give you literature."</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.757" offset="5863027">If that had happened, I believe, even the Board would say, "Well, now, we can't do anything about it because each of the employees has an opportunity to get the literature."</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.165" offset="5892598">Can we tell that to our employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.836" offset="5899285">We say no under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.379" offset="5905450">The statute gives them the right to say, "I don't want that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.423" offset="5945678">I think it was the decision of Mr. Justice Reed in Stowe Spinning had called attention to the fact that the law forbids only interference and I think there are quotations, abundant quotations in the Beard case which call attention to the fact that convenience is not the test that the usual method of solicitation, radio, periodicals, mail, local agencies are open, the usual methods of seeking business are left open and that the mere fact that such methods do not produce as much business is constitutionally immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.591" offset="6178273">We call attention to the fact that they had this nonstop method of driving in Babcock &amp; Wilcox in our case whether we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.133" offset="6264477">The Board's counsel called attention to the fact that in the Babcock &amp; Wilcox case, when these outside union representatives wanted to distribute that defense case, the local authorities were called by the management and stop their distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.202" offset="6324767">No such fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.647" offset="6346501">And then, board counsel, I believe, also called the attention of the fact that in Babcock &amp; Wilcox, the employees were not permitted to distribute where for they needed help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.568" offset="6382237">The fact is that is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.306" offset="6389133">We have an affirmative record, if it please the Court, a record on which affirmatively and positively shows the fullest recognition by an employer of the rights of his employees and even more important, the fullest exercise by those employees of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.410" offset="6441587">And for that reason, we think the finding of the court below that LeTourneau in effect was dispositive, fell into the same error that the Board had fallen into.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.946" offset="8495752">Your Honor, I must express myself as being a little bit shocked because I -- I argued this case in the Circuit -- in the Sixth Circuit and Mr. Bernard in this, who was the lawyer for the Board who tried the case, argued the case against me and Judge John Martin interrupted me when I was discussing the attack upon the Board's brief about this opportunity for discussion and he said, "Mr. Schwartz, you can be assured that if this Court should enforce the order, it's enforcing the order as written and not the Board's brief."</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.615" offset="8610377">But now, I find that the Board indicates to us in argument here that they would interpret their order which says one thing reasonably to include something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.861" offset="8651442">And as this Court said, the majority opinion in Stowe Spinning Company, when we have an injunction or to let us have an order that says what it means, that tells the employer what it is going to do not to come to its adversary a year later or six months later and say, "What happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.852" offset="8719360">How are we going to interpret this order?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.373" offset="8729391">That is an unusual proceeding when basically you go to your adversary and say, "How are you going to interpret this injunction against us?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.577" offset="8762305">In the court -- in the court below, I think, the Court missed the point that I made about opportunity for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.543" offset="8786129">The point that I attempted to make there when I was cutoff by Judge Martin and I'm not critical of him because the Court always has that right, maybe I hadn't made myself clear up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.317" offset="8825208">And the point I'm making here is that the argument by the Board about opportunity for discussion shows that the real basis for the Board's order was not the difficulty or the impossibility of distributing literature but the convenience and the opportunity of solicitation and of arguments and so forth.</text>
