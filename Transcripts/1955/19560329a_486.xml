            <text syncTime="11.397" offset="45558">Mr. Findling.</text>

            <label>Mr. David P. Findling</label>
            <text syncTime="22.235" offset="88921">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.112" offset="104385">This case which the Labor Board has brought here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, presents the question whether the obligation to bargain collectively in good faith under Section 8 (a) (5) and 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act requires an employer who claims during bargaining negotiation that he can't afford to pay a wage increase asked by a union to furnish the union on request with pertinent information to support its claim of inability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.044" offset="264150">The facts are virtually undisputed and the case arose in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.533" offset="286093">During wage negotiations starting in August 1953 pursuant to a wage reopening clause of the contract between Local 729 of the Ironworkers Union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.030" offset="348056">The union asked for a wage increase of 10 cents (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="91.529" offset="366028">The company rejected the request and offered two and a half cents, claiming in effect that it couldn't afford to pay more.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.006" offset="399987">In that connection, the company's representatives express principally that they are already paying higher wage rates than most of their competitors in the area and that the company was already being underbid on certain jobs by some of its competitors, but the company also said that it was under capitalized, that it was operating under a financial strain, that its margin of profits in relation to cost in sales was low that it never paid any dividends, that it is just negotiated the bank loan for a new equipment and a new lot and that at least suggested that overhead was too high because of inefficient office and perhaps plant procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.099" offset="596323">After engaging in an unsuccessful strike for about a week in support of its wage demands and after the company had put into effect the two and a half cent increase that it has offered to the union, the union asked the company to furnish it with information as to the company's financial situation in support of its claim that it couldn't afford to pay more than two and a half cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.609" offset="702380">While that request was put in different language from time to time, I think it's fair to sum it up as the union negotiator, summed it up with the Labor Board hearing when he said -- and I'm quoting now from pages 15 and 16 of the record, he said that, "The union wanted anything relating to the company's position, any records or what have you, books, accounting sheets, cost, expenditures, whatnot, anything to back the company's position that they're unable to give any more money."</text>
            <text syncTime="212.883" offset="851487">The company offered to show that the wage rates that some of its competitors were paying and it also submitted some bid sheets, showing contracts that it had lost but otherwise it refused the union's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.687" offset="918674">It didn't say that disclosure would be damaging to some legitimate business interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.875" offset="943438">It didn't claim that the union's request was too broad or irrelevant to its claim of inability to pay nor did it suggest that the union's request was unreasonable in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.643" offset="994534">And as a matter of fact the record we suggest that some of the data was readily available.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.398" offset="1025567">The company simply took the position in substance and again I'm quoting from its statement of position, “That final information concerning its affairs was confidential and not pertinent to the discussion, that such information was not a subject of -- a subject matter of bargaining or discussing with the union and that the union had no legal right to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="281.408" offset="1125564">The union pointed out that it wasn't claiming any legal right to bargain about the company's financial affairs, but said the information was necessary so that the men could decide whether they were to press their demand for the 10 cent increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.688" offset="1194736">And the union also said that the company's failure to supply the information created an insurmountable barrier to a successful conclusion of the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.081" offset="1264222">The union representatives also said in substance that the men believed the company was making money and could afford to pay the 10 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.020" offset="1304033">That it was hard for the men to see or understand the overhead and all that stuff as they put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.213" offset="1332767">That the union believed the company competed with other companies outside the immediate geographic area who were paying higher wage rates than the company, and who were nevertheless operating profitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.993" offset="1383967">And they said that if the company really wasn't making money, the men wanted to be shown some proof of it and that they simply couldn't take Mr. Truitt's word for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.508" offset="1429943">The company continued at its refusal to furnish the information, however, insisting as I say that the information was none of the union's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.348" offset="1469336">And so, there was -- there was no discussion of how much information, what kind of information or what form the information should take nor was there any discussion whether it would be satisfactory for the company to go through its records and submit the data to the union or to an accountant or whether the union was insisting that an accountant can come in and go over to the company's books and select the data that he thought was pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.561" offset="1594201">And so, instead of supplying the data, the company went ahead that Christmas and paid the men a bonus, a larger bonus than it had paid in several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.284" offset="1637042">And a little later on, on January 13th, it offered the union two and half cents more, conditional for 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.559" offset="1678211">An offer which it subsequently withdrew for which one of the union committeemen pointed out, emphasized the need for the information because if the company withdrew the -- the raise after 90 days, the men naturally would want to know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.028" offset="1752085">Now on these facts, the Board found that the company had failed to satisfy the collective bargaining requirements of the Act, reaffirming the position that it has consistently taken on this matter since it had first occasioned to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.325" offset="1833273">Back in 1936, in Volume 1 of the N.L.R.B. reports, the Board held that the collective bargaining obligation to deal with the union in a good faith effort to compose differences and to reach a contract if possible, required the company -- required the company having faced its refusal of a wage increase on its inability to pay it, attempt on request by the union to substantiate its economic position by reasonable proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.015" offset="1976007">The Board, therefore, ordered the company to bargain collectively and on request to furnish the union and I'm quoting from this decision, "With such statistical and other information that would substantiate the company's position of inability to pay and would enable the union to discharge its functions as the statutory representative of the employees in the appropriate unit."</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.224" offset="5856862">And in that case Mr. -- Circuit Judge Chase said, "We do not understand this part of the order," That's the language we've been talking about, "To do more than show its good faith in bargaining collectively," this probably ought to require the company to do more than and show its good faith."</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.809" offset="5951216">To bargain collectively in compliance with the statute does not mean that an employer must produce proof to establish that he is right in his business decision as to what he can and cannot afford to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.744" offset="6030942">The Board's order does not require the company to produce any specific business, books and records but information to substantiate its position in bargaining with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.073" offset="6076291">As we interpret this, the requirement of disclosure will be met if the respondent produces whatever relevant information it has to indicate whether it can or cannot afford to comply with the union's demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.526" offset="6130103">And in the McLean-Arkansas case, which the Board also cited in its decision in this case, the Board adopted the findings of a trial examiner which said in affect that exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.505" offset="6181930">Now, of course the word "substantiate" and "proof" carry connotations, perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.826" offset="6239295">But the Board's position is exactly that set forth in Jacobs and McLean-Arkansas, the cases show it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.732" offset="10250867">Well, sir, we started off by talking about competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.728" offset="10266854">We said, "You got our wage rates and we made a special point."</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.591" offset="10282318">This bargaining lasted over a good many weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.480" offset="10293917">I was present at every one of the sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.089" offset="10304261">We went to about six of our competitors and asked them if they would let us in good faith disclose their comparative records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.758" offset="10338952">Five of them said, "All right," the six said, "No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.109" offset="10348356">We'll tell you but you can't tell anybody."</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.108" offset="10356402">So, we went back to the union and we said, "Take a welder in our shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.865" offset="10367373">A welder makes a dollar 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.604" offset="10378344">At the XYZ Company, a dollar 83, at another a dollar 65."</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.925" offset="10399660">So, we show the comparative rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.002" offset="10407915">The union said, "That's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.126" offset="10416483">We still believe you can give the raise."</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.668" offset="10422648">This sir, was before the -- the demand and incidentally, before they made any demands for our records, they went on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.957" offset="10455771">I think in good faith maybe the union should have asked for the records first but they pulled an unsuccessful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.352" offset="10477401">Then they were not satisfied, so we kept talking about competition they said, "Oh, you can get any contracts you want."</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.761" offset="10506971">So, we opened our books to the extent of pulling out, you know when you -- when you bid on a contract and some other body -- somebody else gets it, its customary at least in our region for the company awarding the contract to send a little card to all bidders and tell who got it and what the price was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.985" offset="10571860">So, we picked out a number of contracts, good contracts we'd love to have and we showed who got them and we showed to the union we were underbid by these companies that did get them and we showed to the union that those were the companies that were paying less labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.241" offset="10632882">So, we said we think -- now I told the union, "I don't think you've got any legal right to this information but we want to convince you that we're in good faith."</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.805" offset="10671125">And again, we comeback to that language in the Globe Cotton Mills case, a sincere desire to persuade the other fellow to accept your position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.144" offset="11724487">You've got to grant the concession of giving new wage data.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.842" offset="11747265">The Courts have used that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.664" offset="12034612">Now, if Your Honor please and this applies to all the big companies in the United States, incidentally, a whole a bunch of them in the last two weeks had been writing to me and saying, "For God sakes, work on that case."</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.435" offset="12657685">I thought at that time, Your Honor, there was a good deal of Board law, it's all that has split and the Board had said, “If you say, we'll go broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.554" offset="12686211">You've got to open the books.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.143" offset="12692480">The -- the Board has never said if you plead competition, you have to open your books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.214" offset="12712856">And consequently, throughout the bargaining, I tried my best to hold it on the competition grounds because there was no law about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.298" offset="12741172">But we got off, appealed and I -- I fear that -- actually, I like to tell you this, it's not in the record but it's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.006" offset="12775967">We had a bargaining session between the time the Board had ordered us to give the information and the Circuit Court said, “We didn't have to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.794" offset="12807105">Now, with the law in that status where as far as our -- our concern, it might be that we're going to have to open the books if we use economic matters, and I believe Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe you said, if the company puts it on any other basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.653" offset="12882547">If they don't put on economics, they haven't got to open the books and I understood counsel to say, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.375" offset="12901460">That the Board's order says, "You open the books only if you plead economics."</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.067" offset="12920268">Now, how you can argue on wages without getting the file of economics?</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.942" offset="12931762">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.487" offset="12933851">We tried it once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.965" offset="12939807">We came back at a conclusion of this contract and started talking wages and with the Board's order before me, if you talk economics you got to open your books or that's the way I interpreted the -- the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.852" offset="12995396">We spend about six hours in the most awful bargaining you've ever seen and I say to you that if this order is sustained, it will not help the bargain, it will ruin bargaining because here's an employer who for reasons of his own does not want to disclose his financial data to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.051" offset="13072196">What's he going to do?</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.400" offset="13185567">We think everyday there are people coming applying at our shop for work at our rate, at our wages, that indicates plenty of people walked jobs with us at our present wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.182" offset="13224647">That indicates you're being paid enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.552" offset="13274175">That's not a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.794" offset="13274070">I called up the employment office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.543" offset="13273966">I went back to the union and said they got another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.930" offset="13273861">There are plenty of people waiting on the list there to come down here at our pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.092" offset="13280340">And we had the worst session with me trying carefully to skirt any economics because the Board says, "If you get into economics, open come your books."</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.164" offset="13320568">And trying to think up non-economic reasons on wages is frustrating to say the least.</text>
