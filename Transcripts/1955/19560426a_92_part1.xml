            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="39.894" offset="159556">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.000" offset="163944">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.996" offset="175961">The decision under review in this case is a decision by the Supreme Court of California which set aside by a split decision of four-to-three, an arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.771" offset="243043">The award had been made by the board of arbitrators in favor of the union which is the petitioner here through two individual officers and against the Cutter Laboratories which is the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.966" offset="311798">And this award directed the reinstatement of a discharged employee, Mrs. Doris Walker, with a limited amount of backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.905" offset="355579">Under California law, the decisions by arbitrators are conclusive on the merits, both on findings of fact and determinations of law subject to certain very limited exceptions which I need not go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.542" offset="438126">Here, the California courts accepted the findings of the arbitrators but set aside the Supreme Court, set aside the award on the ground that enforcement of the award would be against public policy as expressed in both federal and state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.599" offset="526315">And the reason why they said it was against public policy was because Mrs. Walker was, as the arbitrators found, a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.468" offset="577829">The key facts which were found by the arbitrators were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.487" offset="601861">Cutter Laboratories manufactures and sells throughout the United States biological and pharmaceutical products.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.022" offset="644075">It has both military customers and civilian customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.949" offset="663719">During World War II, the company was under stringent security regulations and controlled by the military authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.143" offset="704470">And at that time, the Government had the right to require Cutter Laboratories to discharge any employee as a security risk, although, the right, in fact, never had to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.408" offset="753580">Since the end of World War II, the company has been under no such controls, although, I'm sure the Court is aware that the Federal Government has a very expensive program of so-called industrial security.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.590" offset="818260">On October 10, 1946, Doris Walker got a job at Cutter Laboratories, she was hired by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.923" offset="847621">She was first a label clerk and then toward the end of her employment became a clerk typist in the purchasing department.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.237" offset="920869">Soon after she was hired, Mrs. Walker became active in the petitioning union and in its branch at Cutter Laboratories and held successively various positions in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.828" offset="983249">By October of 1949, which is the date in which Mrs. Walker was discharged, she held two positions in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.366" offset="1029433">She was the union's chief shop steward at the Cutter plant and she was also president of the union local which included branches at plants other than Cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.056" offset="1092127">At this time in October of 1949, the union and the company had been engaged in wage negotiations and they had reached at the particular time, more or less of an in pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.743" offset="1150955">These negotiations were being carried on under a wage reopener clause in an existing collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.650" offset="1190557">On October 5th, 1949, Mrs. Walker met as a union representative along with several other union representatives, with some of the top officers of the company on the union matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.045" offset="1248131">And in the course of that meeting, the executive vice president of the company expressed anger and irritation over conduct by the unions, specifically a broadcast, a radio broadcast by the union dealing with the wage negotiations at Cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.012" offset="1327961">That was October 5th, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.851" offset="1343321">The very next day, October 6th, 1949, Mrs. Walker was called in to the office of the top personnel man and she was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.064" offset="1388251">To quote from the arbitrators' award, this discharge “was the discharge of top union official and negotiator at a passionate climax in the middle of a stubbornly contested wage negotiation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="364.609" offset="1458364">At the time of the discharge, the company read to Mrs. Walker, a prepared written statement to the effect that the reason they were discharging her was because she had made false representations on her application for employment which she had tooled out some three years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.356" offset="1545404">Because the company was convinced as a result of an investigation that she was a member of the Communist Party and that the nature of Cutter's business required the company to take precautions against sabotage and subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.334" offset="1617293">That very same day, shortly after Mrs. Walker was discharged, the company called a meeting of the employees of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.106" offset="1660343">And at this meeting, it read the discharge clause statement which it had read to Mrs. Walker who was the president of the union at this plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.553" offset="1710184">At the same meeting, remarks were made by company officials, telling employees “get out of that left wing union” and saying “nothing but a left wing union would press for wage increases at this time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="444.674" offset="1778625">In other words, and now I'm making my own comment rather than the arbitrators, the discharge was exploited that very same day to oppose the union's demand for a wage increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.298" offset="1849156">As the arbitrators found during the entire period of her employment of some three years, Mrs. Walker's conduct and performance on the job had been consistently satisfactory to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.463" offset="1909760">And at no time had there been at the Cutter plant any strike or any interference with production for about political or revolutionary objective, such strike or activities, there had been -- had clearly been legitimate union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.630" offset="1982485">Mrs. Walker also, as the arbitrators found, has never been arrested or convicted of any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.552" offset="2014145">Mrs. Walker's discharge after exhaustion of the contractual grievance procedure went to arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement between the union and the company which agreement provided for binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.294" offset="2089169">The issue before the arbitrators was whether the discharge had violated two particular clauses of the collective-bargaining agreement.One clause prohibited the discharge of any employee except for just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.429" offset="2165656">And the arbitrators construe the -- a discharge for unjust cause to mean a discharge which was not based upon grounds reasonably related to the employee's competence, performance, and general suitability in the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.104" offset="2240366">That was one issue and if the union went on that, Mrs. Walker had to be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.328" offset="2273280">An alternative and the second issue was under a second clause of the contract which was whether the discharge was based upon a motive by the company to interfere with union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.534" offset="2334093">The union charged violations of both clauses of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.001" offset="2355931">At the arbitration hearing, the company took the position that it discharged Mrs. Walker for the two reasons that it had given Mrs. Walker when it discharged her, namely, that she had falsified her application form in various respects, that she was a Communist, and that the company was afraid of the possibilities of sabotage by a Communist employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.662" offset="2462616">Mrs. Walker admitted and the arbitrators found that she had falsified her employment application with regard to her education, concealing her full educational background and substituting a fictitious work history for her actual work history and that she had done this because she felt that if the company knew that she was overeducated for the position, if it knew that she had had a certain work experience particularly representing labor unions, she didn't think she would be hired as a typist.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.164" offset="2628650">I may say that actually there's no real issue here under the decision by the Supreme Court of California regarding the falsification of the employment application in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.948" offset="2679745">The real question comes with regard to the claim of discharge because she was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.108" offset="2708376">At the arbitration hearing, the company introduced evidence which satisfied the arbitrators that Mrs. Walker was a Communist and that the company honestly believe that she was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.526" offset="2766054">Mrs. Walker, who was a witness at the hearing, refused to answer a whole series and string of questions propounded by the company's lawyer designed to establish that she was a Communist and very -- and they devoted an act of Communist, her refusal was on the grounds that these questions were an unwarranted invasion into her private beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.200" offset="2892800">The arbitrators ruled that the questions were material but said they would not require the witness to answer, however, coupling that with the warning that if the witness did not answer, then, they, the arbitrators, withdraw all justifiable inferences from the refusal to answer the question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="746.481" offset="2985900">No, she just refused from the grounds that this was her private beliefs, it was not of the company's business, had nothing to do with the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.106" offset="3028323">Now, the arbitrators eventually concluded from the record, and we -- we will grant that this Court has to accept that conclusion whether right or wrong is of no consequences right for the purposes of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.903" offset="3115572">The arbitrators eventually concluded from the record, both from the company's evidence and from the refusals to answer, that Mrs. Walker was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.867" offset="3159458">They therefore held that they had not deprived the company of any rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.960" offset="3179833">The company has not been prejudiced by their refusal to direct Mrs. Walker to answer the questions as to whether she was a Communist, because they said that would just had been corroboration of what they found anyway, therefore, the company got what it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.693" offset="3258723">Nevertheless, the arbitrators ruled in favor of the union and they held that Mrs. Walker had, in fact, been discharged without just cause and because of her participation as an officer, an important officer in union negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.231" offset="3336882">Now going into the details, they rested these conclusions heavily on the timing of a discharge on the fact that the company had known for two years or more -- over two years before the discharge and from about six months after Mrs. Walker had hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.466" offset="3421832">In other words, they had known her for two-and-a-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.248" offset="3432908">While Mrs. Walker was working for them, the company had known these facts in substance, namely, it had known that she had falsified her application and it had known that she was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.718" offset="3490795">And the arbitrators pointed out that the company had been indifferent to these facts until the critical union negotiations period, they found that the grounds actually given by the company was stale that they were not the true grounds, that the true grounds were to interfere with the union wage negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.279" offset="3585045">When the company refused to abide by the award, the union went to Court in order to confirm the award under California procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.855" offset="3635409">The Superior Court of California confirmed the award, the intermediate appellate court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.587" offset="3666338">The Supreme Court of California reversed four-to-three holding, as I've already said, that enforcement of the award would be contrary to public policy because of these Communist business.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.317" offset="3741257">Under the California statutes, awards arbitration, at least if by agreement it is meant to be binding, must be enforced by the California courts without reviews subject to very limited exceptions such as corruption on the part of the arbitrators or that they exceeded their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.791" offset="3827148">However, the Supreme Court of California has now also held and that is an obvious -- they must be accepted by this Court that the California courts have authority to refuse, to confirm an award if that would be against the public policy of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.168" offset="3904575">I -- I don't think that this Court can change the California procedure on award.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.862" offset="3939370">At this point, the petitioner and the respondent come to a parting of the ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.690" offset="3974687">We brief the case on one view, they brief it on a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.676" offset="3998616">As we understand the case, we say that the state court refused to confirm the award in favor of the union to reinstate Mrs. Walker on the ground that Mrs. Walker was a Communist and they said it is against public policy to allow a Communist to work in private industry, and we say that is clearly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.467" offset="4117838">The respondent doesn't dispute on legal argumentation but it says that that's not applicable to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.060" offset="4148140">It says that what actually happened is that the board of arbitrators found and the Supreme Court of California interpreted the arbitration award as finding, not that Mrs. Walker was just a member of the Communist Party but that she was a member of the Communist Party, “with the full implications of dedication to sabotage, force, violence and the like which party membership is believe to entail.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.349" offset="4413336">I say originally the quote is from the arbitrators' report and then the Supreme Court of California referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.227" offset="4440816">What they say, is that the arbitrators found that she was found that she was a member with the full implications of dedications to sabotage, which Communist Party membership is believe to entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.661" offset="4482612">Now, this language is regarding full implications, seems to me to be something less than clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.065" offset="4516258">But the respondent's argument is that what the arbitrators found and what the Supreme Court of California said they found was that Mrs. Walker was personally dedicated or devoted to sabotage in violence as a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.026" offset="4600059">And they say, maybe it's unconstitutional to -- to exclude from private employment a person just because she's a Communist, but it isn't unconstitutional to exclude a Communist who has been found to be and is personally dedicated to sabotage and violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.925" offset="5059605">In other words, their position is that Mrs. Walker was found to be a sabotage addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.227" offset="5088862">Like they had narcotics addicts, they say she was a sabotage addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.349" offset="5113313">This rest on a single passage in the arbitrators' report, it's the first two paragraphs at -- at the top of page 29 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.397" offset="5161587">And this thus refer -- that the first two paragraphs on that page -- and this thus refer to membership in a Communist Party with the full implications and dedication to sabotage, force, violence and the like which party membership is believe to entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.141" offset="5228460">And then, they -- they point at the second paragraph it says that the company honestly believe all these things and the accuracy of those beliefs is established in the record as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.265" offset="5277048">So, they say, "Well, that is a finding," that it not only believe that membership -- that membership in the Communist Party had full implications of dedications to sabotage, but it plead that that belief -- but that -- the finding to that belief was accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.617" offset="5350400">I must say that -- that if you try to read those two key paragraphs literally, all you get is sheer gibberish because you can't see how the accuracy of a belief about the nature of party membership has anything to do with the thing which immediately follows it which deals with omissions and falsification on the application for employment, nor can you see that the accuracy of a belief is proven by the last clause of that paragraph that the belief is presently understood by other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.384" offset="5501492">The fact that a lot of people share a belief doesn't mean obviously that the belief is accurate, otherwise, the world would never have changed from flat to round.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.222" offset="5548826">Now, the only sensible interpretation of the passage is that the Board did find that Doris Walker was, in fact, a Communist and that it found that the company honestly believe that she was a Communist and that it found that the company honestly believe than what is a prevalent view that a Communist is a person who is dedicated to sabotage force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.386" offset="5653525">You just can't read that particularly in the context of the report as a whole as anything so preposterous as a finding that Doris Walker was a sabotage addict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.965" offset="5779853">As I say, the notion that an arbitration board would find that somebody is a sabotage addict it's strange on the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.611" offset="5818410">This Board wasn't conducting a lunacy inquisition, it was conducting an ordinary arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.290" offset="5845159">Now, the true meaning of the passage, is what I say it means, becomes crystal clear when you look at the report as a whole because you note that the report, although it compiles the evidence very exhaustively including all the evidence of Mrs. Walker's claimed Communist Party membership, recites no evidence having to do with sabotage or force or violence either by Mrs. Walker, by the Communist Party, by any Communist or by anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.243" offset="5984967">And to us, as it recite any predilection or any evidence showing a predilection on Mrs. Walker's part for such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.884" offset="6023523">Furthermore, the questions asked by Mrs. Walker of the company and which she refused to answer and from which the arbitrators said they might draw inferences, those questions had no reference to sabotage or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.943" offset="6087680">Now, let me come to the -- so -- well, let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.848" offset="6103353">Their view is a -- a abates point which makes no sense in reading the arbitration award and I must say that even -- that you can't really tell what the full implications mean anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.591" offset="6158315">Now, let me turn to the decision of the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.513" offset="6182034">They say, "Well, the Supreme Court of California agreed with their view that the board of arbitrators found that Mrs. Walker personally was a sabotage addict."</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.161" offset="6224562">Now, in the majority opinion, the Court on one occasion paraphrasing respondent's argument thus refer to the arbitrators award as directing reinstatement of a member of the Communist Party "who is dedicated to that parties program of sabotage, force, violence and the like."</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.636" offset="6314527">At another passage, the California court says that the board of arbitrators found that the activity engaged in by Mrs. Walker was "membership in the Communist Party with the full implications of dedication to sabotage force, violence and the like which party membership is believe to entail."</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.898" offset="6407523">So far, it sounds like they have a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.713" offset="6422779">But it is also clear from the opinion, reading the opinion as a whole and reading other passages that to the California Supreme Court, the conclusion that a person is dedicated to sabotage in violence is the automatic and inevitable conclusion from a statement that the person is a Communist at least to these -- has physical consciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.660" offset="6538553">Its theory was, for example, and this appeared from the opinion, that a person who says that he is carrying on the program of the Communist Party and the -- the company introduced a letter in which Doris Walker was purporting to say that it -- it -- she was faithful to the program or principle of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.557" offset="6618175">Its theory was that anybody who says he's faithful or carries on the program of principles of the Communist Party automatically, thereby, acknowledging being a criminal conspirator and a saboteur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.457" offset="6669793">It's making no allowance for the fact that the view of the person making the statement of what our Communist principles doesn't necessarily coincide with the understanding of the majority, the four justices of the Supreme Court of California of what a -- of what are Communist principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.254" offset="6748996">Again, the California court uses Communist Party member indistinguishably with a -- a person who is dedicated to sabotage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.291" offset="6793091">For example at one point in referring to the finding by the arbitrators, the California court said that the Board's finding was that the company "honestly and correctly believe Mrs. Walker to be a knowing and deliberately acting Communist."</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.521" offset="6866024">And another point it said, "Every Communist Party member is a clear and present danger," and at another point it said, "Acts of sabotage are reasonably to be expected from any and every Communist."</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.401" offset="6933525">In short, the California court majority considered that Doris Walker was and was found to be dedicated to sabotage and violence, merely, because it thought that she was and was found to be a Communist in possession of her consciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.684" offset="7010638">The Court establishes the law in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.574" offset="7026207">The proposition that all Communist are ipso facto without the need for proof, personally dedicated to sabotage and violence unless they are not in a coma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.835" offset="7083259">Its view was that the -- an addiction to sabotage was the inevitable conclusion from the finding that Mrs. Walker was a Communist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.079" offset="7980304">Let me go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.579" offset="7986260">The reasoning by the Supreme Court of California that every Communist who was not in a coma is a -- a sabotage addict makes the question, the one which we see it and not the one which the respondent says is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.710" offset="8050834">In other words, the award was denied confirmation on the theory that Doris Walker is a Communist by California law, all Communist are conclusively presumed to be personally addicted to sabotage and violence and this -- and not on the grounds that there was evidence and the arbitrators found that aside from this legal presumption of the nature of Communist that Doris Walker was a sabotage risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.497" offset="8157936">But even if the California court held and now I'm coming to the second question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.005" offset="8187925">But even if the California court held that the arbitrators found that Mrs. Walker was personally addicted to sabotage, that folding is not binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.771" offset="8242991">And even if the arbitrators so held, that holding is not binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.616" offset="8266397">Although, as I say, the only sensible interpretation of the finding is that wasn't so found and the only sensible interpretation of the opinion is that that wasn't so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.319" offset="8305267">But going under a theory, the findings and construction in that respect would not be binding on this Court because the question of constitutional right, a question of the invasion of Doris Walker's constitutional right is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.701" offset="8370782">And if the Court examines the evidence before the arbitrators, all of which is printed in the record, it is impossible to find any evidence that Doris Walker was personally addicted to force and violence or sabotage or any evidence that anybody else was or believe in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.019" offset="8452075">And the same thing is true as I said earlier that none of the question asked of her related to the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.659" offset="8482586">The basic question which this case raises then is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.788" offset="8503066">May the State announce and implement a public policy that Communist should not be employed in private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.255" offset="8540996">In this particular case, the public policy was implemented by refusing to confirm an arbitration award which under California law would have been confirmed and thus enforce for any non-Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.315" offset="8601182">But if the principle of this particular implementation is sound, it necessarily follows that the same public policy that Communist are not allowed to work could be implemented further as for example by state legislation making it a crime for Communist to work in private industry or for Communist to be hired by private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.892" offset="8715494">This public policy that Communists are unemployable was applied in this case, even though the particular immediate victim did not had a sensitive job but was just a typist in the purchasing department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.223" offset="8780800">It was applied even though the employer was not a defense claim, now, it's true that the company's products and operations are susceptible to sabotage but what plant is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.563" offset="8846211">This public policy was applied even though its immediate victim was never convicted of any crime and without any evidence that she personally, actually engaged in or advocated sabotage or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.731" offset="8902844">It was applied even though the victim never had a trial by jury or any other kind of a judicial trial and even though the employer as the arbitrators found were willing to retain it though she was a Communist but they fired her because she was a union official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.133" offset="8980480">Now, I say that due process and equal protection prohibits to state from applying the policy that Communist are not allowed to work in private industry, particularly on the completely undiscriminating basis that was applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.883" offset="9047458">Moreover, I say the manner in which this policy was applied in this case that is where the edict that Doris Walker is an unemployable person was issued without evidence and without a judicial trial, that violates procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.154" offset="9128542">The right of Doris Walker to work in private industry which means her ability to eat is an essential right vital to the preservation of life itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.626" offset="9558413">There is and can be no such basis here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.909" offset="11347592">The rationality of this public policy erected by the Supreme Court of California is underscored by the source from which it derived that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.114" offset="11396389">It relied on chiefly on various states in federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.524" offset="11418018">Among the state legislation relied on was the California criminal syndicalism law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.336" offset="11441319">But this statute is not in effect, it violates the Supremacy Clause as it clearly appears form this Court's decision recently in the Steve Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.586" offset="11482279">So we have case of public policy derived in part from superseded legislation which violates the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.813" offset="11515193">Among the federal legislation relied on is the Smith Act, and the Smith Act doesn't say anything about Communist or communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.536" offset="11546122">It is after for -- only the persons who are convicted at the trial by jury, after having a presumption of innocence apply of personally advocating violent overthrow of the Government, personally conspiring, so to advocate or belonging to an organization knowing that it advocates violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.065" offset="11628251">From this legislation itself on the edge of unconstitutionality, it was irrational for the California court to distill the proposition that Communist can be punish without trial, without evidence, without the presumption of innocence, without regard to personal innocence and despite a lack of guilty now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.899" offset="11723546">The California court had solved one of the Smith Act problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.383" offset="11741518">There's been a problem under the Smith Act of whether -- of whether Communist can get fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.319" offset="11765238">It solved the problem, it says don't give him any trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.352" offset="11793345">This whole thing is so irrational that -- that it -- it reaches a -- a level which is obnoxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.076" offset="11836291">If all Communist are alike -- if all Communist made anytime a drop of bomb, I suppose it would be reasonable if Mr. Sean O'Casey who was a Communist in a capitalist country and Picasso who is a Communist in a capitalist country, I suppose it would be reasonable to lock them up because they might go to a theater, they might go to an art gallery, they might throw a bomb, they therefore dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.061" offset="11952170">I say that no such thing can stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.278" offset="11977038">This whole thing is a clear violation of due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.415" offset="12001593">Let me now turn to my second point, and that is that this public policy which has been applied by the Supreme Court of California and which was invented by it cannot stand because it violates federal policy and federal enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.127" offset="12076408">And the first of these is the federal policy created by the National Labor Relations Act, the Taft-Hartley Act in the interest of protecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.050" offset="12116114">The decision below holds that Communists are not entitled to the protection of union representation or the protection of a collective-bargaining contract, because if a union can't make a contract which protects your employment rights or protects your salary, it's perfectly obvious that they can't represent you in any effectual meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.705" offset="12218723">But the National Labor Relations Act sets forth its policy very clearly and it says that all employees in interstate commerce should be allowed to be and must be allowed to be represented by labor unions and must be allowed the privilege of collective-bargaining through unions of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.434" offset="12309734">Furthermore, the policy of the Act, as expressed in Section 83, is that labor unions should be protected against discriminatory discharges because of union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.318" offset="12353202">Now, those policies of the Act which are federal law apply whether the person, the employee involved is a Communist or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.571" offset="12390191">The Act doesn't say that only non-Communist can bargain to labor unions and only non-Communist can join a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.750" offset="12426971">Now, its true that in Section 9 (h), the Congress showed that they didn't want Communist to be officers of unions, but they never went so far as to provide that Communist can't be represented by union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.000" offset="12511922">The amicus brief and I should make this point of the National Association of Manufactures which has been filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.262" offset="12545045">The N. A. M. filed a brief on the laboratory side and the American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.045" offset="12576078">The amicus brief to the N. A. M. suggest that if there is a conflict between the decision below and the National Labor Relations Act, then, it says -- I'll resume after lunch.</text>
