            <label>Mr. Will Maslow</label>
            <text syncTime="34.089" offset="136255">If the Court please, this case is hereby writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had affirmed a District Court refusal to issue a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.029" offset="192052">The alien petitioner here had sort by that writs to review an order of the immigration service which had directed his deportation and simultaneously had denied his application for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.836" offset="267285">The alien, however, no longer contest his deportability and the sole issue, therefore, before this Court, is whether the Attorney General has lawfully denied the alien's application for this discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.742" offset="346906">The alien as a British subject, 65 years old, who has lived in this country continuously since 1921, a period of 35 years, he was ordered deported in 1951 because he admittedly had been a member of the Communist Party of United States from 1935 to 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.626" offset="450456">At that time, the alien was not eligible for the discretionary relief of suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.578" offset="482220">However, in 1952, the Congress, when it enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act, for the first time, allowed the Attorney General to suspend the deportation of those found guilty of having been past members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.901" offset="559543">Accordingly, the alien petitioned the Board of Immigration Appeals to withdraw the order of deportation, to reopen the deportation hearing and to consider his application for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.431" offset="625685">That was done, and in 1953, the reopen hearing began.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.357" offset="665391">Now, at that time, to qualify under the statute for this discretionary relief, four conditions had to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.407" offset="713561">First, the alien had to show that he had been continuously a resident of United States for the last 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.623" offset="758491">Secondly, he had to show that he had been a good moral character during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.822" offset="791197">Thirdly, he had to show in the language of the statute that the deportation would result an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to him or to his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.457" offset="845740">And fourthly, the -- no final order of deportation could be in effect to qualify him for this discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.672" offset="894642">The Attorney General who was given the statutory power to suspend deportation has delegated it by regulation to a core of officers in the Immigration Service known as special inquiry officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.596" offset="966322">And he has likewise prescribed most precisely the hearing procedure to pass upon these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.683" offset="1006655">The special inquiry officer therefore who heard this alien's application in 1953 found specifically that the alien had met all of the statutory qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.429" offset="1069662">Indeed, he found in addition that the alien had not been a member of the Communist Party since 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.975" offset="1111876">And then his opinion goes on to state and I quote all of the opinion, it's just two sentences and it maybe found at page 48 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.600" offset="1162344">This is the language of the special officer, “However, after considering confidential information relating to the respondent, as is provided for under 8 CFR 244.3, it is concluded that the respondent's case does not warrant favorable action and that his application for suspension of deportation should be denied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="317.527" offset="1270073">There is nothing further in the opinion about it nor is there any reference -- was there any reference in the hearing to any confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.389" offset="1313541">At this reopened hearing, the only witnesses called were those called by the alien, the Government made no effort to introduce any evidence that in any ways derogatory to the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.075" offset="1372264">And as far as anyone can tell, by looking at the record, there is nothing there to justify the denial of his application.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="349.878" offset="1399432">Was anything said at the hearing that indicated that this confidential information was going to be relied on?</text>

          <turn speaker="will_maslow" startTime="355.934" stopTime="427.913">
            <label>Mr. Will Maslow</label>
            <text syncTime="355.934" offset="1423673">Nothing, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.463" offset="1429838">In fact, the Government introduced at this hearing, an FBI investigative report.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.580" offset="1466305">That report discloses nothing derogatory to the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.473" offset="1489816">He'd simply gave his fingerprints, lack of criminal record, his alien registration number and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.961" offset="1515833">When the alien -- when the alien's application for a suspension was denied, he appealed as he had a legal right to do to the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.385" offset="1561496">That Board dismissed his appeal explicitly resting their dismissal on this regulation, 244.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.924" offset="1607680">Thereafter, he made the same contention in the District Court, in the Circuit Court of Appeals and each of this likewise dismissed his appeal and explicitly upheld the validity of regulation 244.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.429" offset="1677688">That regulation, Your Honors, may be found at page 61 of the Government brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.794" offset="1707154">The crucial case --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="will_maslow" startTime="430.858" stopTime="548.260">
            <label>Mr. Will Maslow</label>
            <text syncTime="430.858" offset="1723350">The crucial -- yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.937" offset="1727739">The crucial case -- the crucial question on this case therefore is whether the Attorney General, having on the one hand by regulation, directed that a hearing should be conducted to pass upon an alien's application for suspension, may on the other hand, vitiate that hearing by authorizing his subordinates to deny such relief to an alien admittedly eligible and qualify for it solely on the basis of confidential information, not of record, and which is not disclosed to the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.096" offset="1872353">Incidentally, I might say that in the first Accardi case, Mr. Justice Clark in Footnote Number 5 stated that that was not the issue before the Court in the Accardi case, namely, the validity of this regulation authorizing the nondisclosure of non-record information.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.356" offset="1953332">Now, the alien, in this proceeding, makes three contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.955" offset="1975798">We contend, first of all, that the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General was not authorized by Congress and is therefore invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.879" offset="2015504">Secondly, we contend that even assuming that the regulation is valid, it is inconsistent with other regulations promulgated by the Attorney General and inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and that this Court must therefore reconcile these inconsistencies by directing that a fair resume of the confidential information be disclosed to the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.028" offset="2136085">This is what this Court ordered in the selective service cases beginning with United States against Nugent, Simmons against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.024" offset="2168059">My associate, Mr. Caughlan, will argue the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.799" offset="2183105">Now, independently, appoints one and two --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="548.260" stopTime="552.079">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="548.260" offset="2193032">Did the alien asked for a resume following the coming down of this sentence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="will_maslow" startTime="552.079" stopTime="563.118">
            <label>Mr. Will Maslow</label>
            <text syncTime="552.079" offset="2208287">No, sir he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.679" offset="2226678">He was no position to ask for a resume because at the time of the hearing, he did not know that confidential information would be used against him.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="563.118" stopTime="564.434">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="563.118" offset="2252382">But after the report, did he --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="will_maslow" startTime="564.434" stopTime="980.732">
            <label>Mr. Will Maslow</label>
            <text syncTime="564.434" offset="2257711">No, sir he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.579" offset="2266279">Now, independently of these two points, our third contention is that in violation of an explicit regulation of the Attorney General, which as you know, has the effective law and is binding upon the service, and in effect, spells out the alien's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.682" offset="2346632">The special inquiry officer has failed to state the reasons for denying the application for a suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.008" offset="2375993">Now, there is a specific regulation that makes that requirement and that regulation is likewise found in the appendix to the Government brief, its regulation 242.618.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.986" offset="2439941">My associate, Mr. Caughlan, will -- has argued the third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.594" offset="2458331">Now, before I address myself to the first point, namely, the validity of the regulation, I think it's essential to describe the process by which the Immigration Service passes upon this applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.549" offset="2522175">The service has, in the last five years, deported an average of 20,000 persons a year, and that figure, Your Honors, is exclusive of the so-called Mexican Wetbacks, hundreds of thousands of home are expelled without formal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.270" offset="2609006">And even larger number of hearings is held each year and our brief cites a letter from an assistant commissioner of immigration that there are -- there was in the last fiscal year, 35,00 of these deportation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.937" offset="2671700">In forfeit of these hearings, deportation is not an issue so that you have perhaps 20,000 hearings a year in which the sole issue is whether or not the order of deportation shall be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.411" offset="2753620">Incidentally, the term suspended is a word of art because if suspension is actually granted, the deportation proceeding is canceled and the alien's right to remain in this country is legalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.136" offset="2808477">Now, to deal with these mass of applications, the Attorney General, as by regulation prescribed a hearing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.187" offset="2860722">First of all, he is -- the regulations provide -- these regulations are all cited in the brief of the amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.923" offset="2891651">Regulations provide that the application for a suspension can only be made during the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.386" offset="2917460">In fact, this is almost a statutory requirement because until the deportation -- if a deportation order is outstanding, the alien is not qualified under the statute, and therefore, the deportation order must be set aside as was done in the case at bar, or else -- and that is the common procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.413" offset="3009620">In one hearing, the special inquiry officer disposes of the question of deportability and the second question of whether suspension shall be granted and the service encourages this because it does not want to have the expense and inconvenience of having two hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.977" offset="3079837">Now, the hearing whose incidents are described in regulation 24.2 in the Government's -- reprinted in the appendix to the Government's brief is a formal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.292" offset="3137097">The term hearing, incidentally, is in the regulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.859" offset="3147337">There is a regulation that specifically says that this shall be called a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.188" offset="3164682">The alien is represented by counsel, witnesses are sworn, they are examined and cross-examined, the exhibits are put to the record, a transcript is kept, there is, in other words, all of the indicia of what we know as an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.548" offset="3242109">Following the hearing, the regulations require the special inquiry officer to hand down a written decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.488" offset="3277949">In that decision, according to regulations, he must dispose of the issue of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.418" offset="3301669">Then the regulations provide that if the alien has made an application for suspension that his decision shall contain, and here I quote again from the regulation appearing at Government's brief page 60, his decision shall contain, "A discussion of the evidence relating to the alien's eligibility for relief and the reasons for granting or denying such application."</text>
            <text syncTime="856.903" offset="3427579">Then he issues an order which specifies whether or not the alien shall be deported and whether or not suspension shall be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.132" offset="3476480">It is unlike the practice that existed in 1947, for example, where the hearing officer may have made recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.240" offset="3508872">He has the authority to issue the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.826" offset="3523291">The order of the special officer is final unless he decides it takes an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and the appeal may be taken from the order of deportability for the order granting or declining suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.300" offset="3585149">Each side has an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.519" offset="3594031">The alien, thereafter, has no further administrative rights of appeal although the service thus.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.698" offset="3618691">The service may appeal to the Attorney General or the Attorney General as on motion may review and reverse the Board of Immigration Appeals, although, this is the power which he rarely exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.931" offset="3667696">Now, if the Attorney General allows the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals to stand, the suspension order is still not effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.429" offset="3713672">He is required by Section 244 (c) of the Act just likewise in the appendix of the Government's brief to report the action taken to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.612" offset="3766439">And the statute provides that each case to which suspension is granted by the Attorney General that he must furnished Congress, and I quote, "A complete and detailed statement of the facts in pertinent provisions of law in the case with the reasons for such suspension."</text>
            <text syncTime="960.891" offset="3843553">The Congress then has two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.467" offset="3853793">It may, by affirmative resolution, agree with the Attorney General, in which case, the proceedings of counsel that his stay is legalized or it may disapprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.545" offset="3906142">If it fails to approve, the alien must depart from this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.991" offset="4039889">As a matter of fact, the regulations prescribed that the very beginning of the hearing before the witness as even before the alien has -- they even put on every evidence, the regulations prescribed that the special officer shall advice the alien of his right to this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.290" offset="4105091">And then it's within the discretion of the hearing officer of the order in which the proof is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.481" offset="4141871">Now, the nub of this case therefore is regulation 244.3 which empowers these special officers aboard in the case of any alien qualified for suspension to grant or denies such relief on the basis of confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.660" offset="4242599">Without disclosing it to the alien, it's in the opinion of the special officer or of the Board, with that determinations made on appeal, such disclosure would be prejudicial to public interest safety or security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.151" offset="4312503">Your Honors will note there is no requirement that the special inquiry officer consult with anyone into the department before he labels these materials confidential.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.308" offset="7021192">The second point which petitioner wishes to make at this time is that the Attorney General has prescribed two regulations or two sets of regulations which both require a fair hearing and which permit the use of confidential information that these two inconsistent regulations can be reconciled only by requiring that a fair summary of the confidential information contained in -- the confidential information used by the special inquiry officer shall be furnished to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.340" offset="7253264">Now, this portion of the argument assumes that the regulation 244.3, the regulation which -- which permits the use of confidential information is a valid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.512" offset="7338005">There is no requirement specifically, of course, in the statute in Section 244, the Immigration Act, providing for suspension of deportation that any hearing or any specific type of procedure be filed by the Attorney General in determining a suspension of deportation application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.545" offset="7446152">However, as has been pointed out by Mr. Meslow, suspension of deportation has been a very important part of the congressional scheme with reference to immigration nationality and -- with reference to immigration, since the first enactment of a statute providing for suspension in 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.593" offset="7718348">The fact is, of course, that the Attorney General has from the first instance in which Congress pass a suspension statute, sir, has required -- has authorized and is directed some kind of hearing on suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.258" offset="7792953">Our position here is that having directed a hearing and under the current statute which is referred to on page 23 of the amicus curiae brief of the American-Jewish Congress, under the current statute the hearing specifically referred to -- that's at the top of page 23, 8 CFR 242.53 specifically provides that the special inquiry officer conduct a fair and impartial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.886" offset="7959510">Now, this requirement for a fair and impartial hearing is a requirement which is set forth to some detail, the method in which the hearing should be conducted and it's requiring that was discussed, the requirement that was discussed by this Court in the first Accardi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.926" offset="8063687">The requirement for a fair hearing was involved there in a suspension case at that -- in that case it was at the second state before the Board of Immigration Appeals, but the Court stated that, speaking through Mr. Justice Clark and the majority of the Court, that the Board must exercise its own independent discretion after a fair hearing which is nothing more than the regulations accord the petitioner as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.966" offset="8191791">Then the opinion goes on to say that the Attorney -- that the petitioner may still fail to convince the Board or the Attorney General in the exercise of their discretion that he is entitled to suspension, but at least he will have been afforded that due process required by the regulations in such proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.339" offset="10493283">Now, it's our position then that the Nugent case represents a manner in which these two can be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.891" offset="10543543">Our third point, which I now -- which to come to, is that regardless of whether Section 244.3 going for section -- regulation going for confidential information is authorized regardless of whether this Court should require in reconciling these two irreconcilable provisions that the confidential, some resume of the confidential information be framed that there's another reason in which must call for a reversal of the action in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.231" offset="10984908">Now, here is what the record gave as to reasons for granting deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.993" offset="11023882">This appears on page 47 and 48 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.379" offset="11041437">On page 47 and the top of page 48 in the very short decision of the special inquiry officer, which consumes only two pages of the record, there is contained a three or two and half paragraph summary of the evidence in the case in which the facts concerning the petitioner are discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.508" offset="11141956">The facts relating to that he has shown his good moral character is the extremely unusual, the exceptionally, extremely unusual hardship which we call him, the other fact is relating to eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.352" offset="11201306">This is the only thing else in the record regarding which relates in any way to reasons for denial of suspension of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.962" offset="11243833">On the record -- for denial of suspension of deportation -- on the record, the respondent appears to be qualified for suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.456" offset="11285734">However, after considering confidential information relating to the respondent as this is provided for under Section 8 CFR 244.3, it is concluded that the respondent's case does not warrant favorable action and that his application for suspension of deportation be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.169" offset="11368594">Now, if it please the Court, this is not a statement of reasons for denying suspension of deportation and I don't see anyway in which it could be tortured into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.379" offset="11433482">This is a statement of why no reasons are given for suspension of deportation.</text>
