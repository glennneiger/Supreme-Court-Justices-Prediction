            <label>Mr. Silas Blake Axtell</label>
            <text syncTime="24.036" offset="199555">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.025" offset="239470">Nearly 40 years ago when I first appeared in this Court for a sailor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.883" offset="262875">I've been working for seaman for eight years before that exclusively and have continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.270" offset="312404">This case is one, very difficult to discuss and I'm going to refrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.668" offset="346049">I'm going into details as to what caused the injury to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.600" offset="377814">The plaintiff was born in Georgia, 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.283" offset="400488">Speaking of his education, he said that if I must answer that question, I have to tell you that the facilities for colored people in Georgia when I was a boy were very inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.366" offset="468825">But learning, I had since I gotten on the ships and running around.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.138" offset="499963">The man, William Thompson was a tall, very strong person of normal outlook upon life, and a competent cook, have been a chief cook and assistant chief cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.308" offset="580629">He signed out not ago on this ship and Marron, Rosina Marron they called her of the Coastal Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.651" offset="625977">On December 1st, 1949, he was injured on the 12th of January, some 52 days after he had joined the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.385" offset="696926">If Your Honors would examine, the appellee's record and brief in the original court at -- you'll turn to page 42, 43, 45, and, particularly, 47 you will see a corroboration by the chief steward of the vessel of the very, very serious charges made by Thompson to the delegates of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.486" offset="841331">When I began for seaman, we didn't have unions to the extent they have them now, we had a union but it was a poor thing so that it's a chief attorney and its chief president or officer and (Inaudible) came to me, the boy in charge of the seaman, the branch of the legal aid society for a legal advice because it didn't cost anything but he made the slave of me while he made free men of the sailors.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.523" offset="981452">The man, Thompson, revolted that what he had seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.996" offset="1011336">He went down the alley way to get some men to play poker.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.321" offset="1024606">He had a -- he love playing poker.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.571" offset="1045608">He opened the door, what he saw was so terrible especially as there was an extra man in the room with the three offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.345" offset="1104750">He reported it to chief steward immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.164" offset="1116035">Schiffers whose testimony we took.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.677" offset="1126066">We took his testimony after he had been examined by the defendants in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.074" offset="1147695">They didn't know what his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.422" offset="1153024">They didn't even want his statement, as that appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.668" offset="1177997">Schiffers did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.916" offset="1199000">He did nothing when he saw what he had seen two months before this --disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.593" offset="1221778">The master knew it, the chief mate knew it, they all knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.206" offset="1232227">They tolerated it, a condition that's intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.088" offset="1263679">As a father of six sons, I think, it's a matter of public interest for all of us, ashore or on the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.975" offset="1323238">Such people should be controlled or eliminated from contact with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.751" offset="1370363">They had delegates, one for the deck department, one for the engine room department, one for the steward department.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.246" offset="1396381">We took the testimony of Kaplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.745" offset="1406307">His testimony appears also in this appellee's additional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.452" offset="1433161">Kaplus verified but the plaintiff had said he was present at the hearing of the three delegates, the next evening, the night of January 13th, the night of the attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.285" offset="1504528">This horrible thing allowed to walk of three amongst men, born in Cuba didn't want to leave the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.350" offset="1548727">He'd worked into four or five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.711" offset="1562206">He like the job and his associates or referred as in another name, I won't mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.948" offset="1619153">At the meeting, Young, the chief pumpman and the ship's chairman as they call it, said, "What do you got, Thompson?</text>
            <text syncTime="389.940" offset="1663143">You have no witness to corroborate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.966" offset="1671189">You're all alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.138" offset="1683937">What can you do?"</text>
            <text syncTime="396.803" offset="1690624">He said, "Well, I demand that these men leave the ship."</text>
            <text syncTime="402.021" offset="1711417">They could have called it the attention of a coast guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.592" offset="1725733">I don't suppose they knew about the United States Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.350" offset="1744750">But it was a union affair and they were going to quash it.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.750" offset="1758333">Get rid of the men in his own way.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.554" offset="1765543">This one man, a Negro from Georgia, born in 1892 with characteristics that you and I should emulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.763" offset="1826461">He alone challenged these three horrible things together with the man who was a witness to it in that room, alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.791" offset="1882572">And he said, "What can we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.044" offset="1891558">Where's your evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.042" offset="1895528">Where is your corroboration?"</text>
            <text syncTime="451.017" offset="1907440">They didn't call the chief steward to say what he saw two months earlier and everybody else saw in that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.329" offset="1956655">What did the murderer do?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.613" offset="1969821">He was heard by Kaplus, I referred to it in our brief, to have said, "I'll kill that."</text>
            <text syncTime="477.100" offset="2011721">As of the -- he went and got the key from the chief cook and went into the galley and got a cleaver of the weight of this but more the size of this one, in the left, both of which were in evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.488" offset="2125302">He waited in an alleyway in a dark place and when Thompson came by alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.907" offset="2147035">He stood behind him and we was not a small man and came down on Thompson, hit like that, twice, third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.191" offset="2184129">Braising only the scalp but the two blows penetrated both tables of his skull.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.303" offset="2216626">The man fell, moaning to the deck, I'm -- I'm dead -- I'm dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.359" offset="2240763">His instinct then lapsing consciousness permitted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.599" offset="2257795">Had he not had that native wit, that fiend will chop him from the top of his face and head until he was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.460" offset="2305233">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="551.965" offset="2311189">They say $4000 was a reasonable compensation for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.408" offset="2340968">I would say that if there was no injury to endure such an experience with a life of serving in the ships ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.993" offset="2387362">Man, you even work for 45 years already.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.626" offset="2401886">He had a few years left, to see a meat cleaver daily in his work is sufficient cause for the neurosis from which he suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.875" offset="2458833">Now, getting down to the law of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.620" offset="2485896">The Circuit Court reversed.We asked for re-argument immediately or in that Court, to grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.521" offset="2537409">Judge Biggs of Delaware, Judge McLaughlin of New Jersey dissented and their findings were strictly in accordance with the principles of law as established by this great Court in Garrett against Moore-McCormack.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.326" offset="2624658">The other five judges, Hastie, Staley, Maris, well in any rate, they're all from Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.531" offset="2689546">I'm certainly I do not imply that this is a conspiracy from Pennsylvania to reinstate what you disallowed and overruled in the Garrett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.763" offset="2746389">The Garrett case was a Pennsylvania case.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.625" offset="2757883">If you have time to look at the decision, you then reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.503" offset="2781393">You will find there the statement that in this State, there has never been a Court of Chancery.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.502" offset="2817337">Our equity is administered by our courts at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.129" offset="2843878">And you will find that there is ingrained in that procedure, the proposition that the burden of proving the release, rests, proving there to us that the relief should be set aside rest upon the man's seeking to set is aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.559" offset="2953592">In our federal court, the rule is the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.819" offset="2974699">The burden is upon the man who defends release in this case for $4000.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.911" offset="3006986">The plaintiff in this case was a member and a (Inaudible) Union for whom I was counsel for all my life, until it went out of their business under the drive of the Communist horde.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.374" offset="3092877">He was one of those men that union men called "company men".</text>
            <text syncTime="756.199" offset="3128195">Read if you have time, the letters that he wrote to the company, beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.686" offset="3154108">Telling about how he was annoyed by lawyers who wanted to give him advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.740" offset="3182320">He pushed him away.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.982" offset="3195277">I think they shouldn't have been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.088" offset="3219728">But what are we going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="782.140" offset="3231953">The law schools are pouring him out with thousands.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.220" offset="3248253">What are they going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="792.216" offset="3272286">Do we have to revert to Marxian compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="797.904" offset="3294960">Marxian compensation to avoid this thing, I hope not.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.756" offset="3326412">He was a company man.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.018" offset="3335398">He sought to ingratiate himself in the minds of his employer, Mr. Mahoney.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.245" offset="3380328">He told them how bad he felt but he's going to get well and he was going to go back to save his job on the Rosina Marron.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.230" offset="3424319">And when he transferred from one hospital to another, three of them in the south, I believe, finally appearing in the District Court for the trial of the culprit.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.001" offset="3479385">The first trial was a mistrial and second trial resulted in a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.084" offset="3511672">The coast guard had gotten rid of him, gone back to his native, Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.522" offset="3569455">At any rate, the man is a nervous wreck, his work is true but he has told us of his suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.197" offset="3640195">I personally prepared this case for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.107" offset="3655764">I was present when it was tried except for the time when Barron, the conjecture was questioned and said that he had told Mr. Thompson about Dr.Farr's report that he had only a 10% permanent disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.032" offset="3763493">Well, the difference is that the plaintiff was under impression that he was well.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.400" offset="3820962">There is an article here in the Saturday post last week on Schizophrenics that is in enlightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.559" offset="3861608">These -- these men, they get to be very up buoyant, optimistic, then they go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.378" offset="3904867">This man borrowed $50 from men in the hospital in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.314" offset="3928586">He got $100 more and then went to their office and got $300 to go to Arkansas to get hot baths, so he feels better.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.414" offset="3965053">He came back feeling fine, was sent to Dr.Farr for the second time -- no, the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.246" offset="4008312">And they came back optimistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.360" offset="4016776">The hospital record said he was practically cured and nothing wrong with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.122" offset="4047809">The hospital record shows encephalopathy of the brain by trauma.He thought he was cured and he had lost about $2000 in maintenance and wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.912" offset="4107055">They were giving him $2000 extra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.186" offset="4120116">He would go into work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.300" offset="4128580">But when he returned to work and he had to use this meat axe and the heat of the galley, he found hot flashes on his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.930" offset="4163062">He imagined it in a place where he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.908" offset="4183019">Completely nervous, unable to stay at any job more than a little while, rushing on -- I never forget the time when he would -- in my office waiting for the trial if he could get it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.940" offset="4239130">We pressed for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.175" offset="4248116">They opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.549" offset="4257520">Finally, on condition we waive a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.923" offset="4271104">They said they've tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.376" offset="4280926">They had one of these offenders, his deposition in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.707" offset="4298167">He denied everything of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.823" offset="4310706">The injury is very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.965" offset="4323244">We felt as lawyers if the Court gave him in $20,000 not more than half what he might have but that figure was one the plaintiff had fixed for himself in his negotiation to these underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.008" offset="4391372">And they have said, "But you're all right now."</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.126" offset="6607914">The McAllister case by Judge Minton, you recall the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.679" offset="6634036">Was it from the open latrine on the deck where the Chinese longshoremen were brought or permitted or was it from a visit ashore?</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.487" offset="6729331">Does your -- do Your Honors, want a succession of appeals like this or do you consider if expedient and proper in this time to follow the doctrine of the McAllister case which has been followed in all the Circuits practically to get rid of these disputed questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.017" offset="6815431">This trial is de novo, were invented, I presume by expediency like when the early cases I tried in Philadelphia where I had a mistrial because I mentioned to the jury the amount we're going to sue for or asking for, a rule peculiar to Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.616" offset="6889827">That had a reason -- I presume in a similar railroad case where there was no other way to reverse the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.470" offset="7237256">I realized that my task is to sustain this release and to urge the Court to render an opinion on this reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.868" offset="7274872">Reiterating Justice Black's holding in the Garrett case so that the maritime industry as a whole has -- who are looking at this case most eagerly had something to determine just where they stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.156" offset="7351986">I might say that if a release entered into one of the circumstances that Thompson -- surrendering Thompson release, it set aside here that the whole amicable adjustment, 90% of the seaman's claims today, I'm talking about today and a few years ago of being settled out of Court that are quick release so the man doesn't have to wait four or five years for this case to come up and pay attorney's fees and doctor's fees and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.045" offset="7467551">Before -- before going into a brief summary of the facts, I think, it's just important to -- for the -- my further argument to really reiterate the three-fold holding of the Garrett case, one then, I admit representing the steamship company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.897" offset="7550934">I have the burden of proof which I contend was sustained when the Circuit Court reversed the District Court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.296" offset="7588551">It's clearly erroneous under the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.737" offset="7602343">The second element of the Garrett decision was that we must prove that the seaman signed the release with a full understanding of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.333" offset="7648737">And the third, and this is most important, I think, in consideration with Your Honor's question, the mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.889" offset="7674964">“The adequacy of the consideration and the nature of the legal and medical advise available at the time the release was signed are ought to be considered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.878" offset="7734836">Just by hitting highlights, I think, it's important just to point out to the Court that a lot seaman has changed so considerably over the years.I mean, the days of Captain Bligh, Moby Dick and the whipping post of gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.126" offset="7803904">Things have changed considerably since Mr. Axtell has -- have been representing seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.067" offset="7827623">I saw that he had a quote that he published and his one published by the attorney for the National Maritime Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.207" offset="7852178">This is a summary for the seaman of -- of what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.057" offset="7867643">This is given to the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.894" offset="7874957">There is no question here for instance that Thompson himself had executed releases before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.417" offset="7905050">He's let us knew -- summarized in the appendix that he -- I think he wrote about eight of them to the company and telling them how he felt.</text>
