            <label>Mr. Carl H. Imlay</label>
            <text syncTime="19.351" offset="77322">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.235" offset="88921">The Court will recall that the instant cases involved the question of whether venue for the crime of failing to report for work of national importance lies in the judicial district of the local board which issued the order, commanding that the registrant, the conscientious objector registrants report to the work or whether venue for this crime of failing to report lies in the judicial district for the registrant who was obligated to report and do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.588" offset="254328">Now, at the close of yesterday's sitting, I'd referred the Court to the order to report form which was to send each of these registrants and which defines the duties, the obligations of each of the registrants in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.726" offset="362893">That order appears on page 56 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.086" offset="384313">Now, I had explained that this form notifies the registrant, the conscientious objector registrant of his assignment to work of national importance and each of these cases that work lay outside of the judicial district in which his local board was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.258" offset="484937">I also referred the Court's attention to the fact that in literal terms, this order is comprised really of two orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.536" offset="538122">The first order compels the -- the registrant to report to his local board at a specific time where he would be given instructions to proceed to the place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.427" offset="605623">I had explained that on reporting to the local board the registrant was notified, the registrant already had his work assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.596" offset="658286">He -- he had -- was notified 10 -- 10 days before the time for reporting for the local board of his specific work assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.655" offset="694544">But in order to brief him and -- and ensure that he would understand in every particular, the nature of his duty, he -- he was ordered to come to the local board and -- in this cases while the registrant has given a -- usually a written instruction sheet telling him the precise person to whom to report at the destination, at the -- in this case a -- a state hospital was the work of national importance assigned to each of these registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.708" offset="854831">He was also given the hour, the time for reporting at the place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.740" offset="890880">That might be anywhere from a few hours to several days, maybe a -- a couple of weeks away from the time when he reported to the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.669" offset="946573">Now, that is the first order to report to the local board, the second order on this form.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.621" offset="970397">You are ordered to report for employment, pursuant to the instructions of the local board to remain in employment for 24 consecutive months until such time as you are released or transferred by proper authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.601" offset="1042390">This order, in other words, has a two-fold purpose to get him to the local board in the first instance and in the second instance to get him to his place of employment at -- at the proper time.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.977" offset="1123892">If he didn't report to the local board, Mr. Justice Clark, the prosecution would lie in the judicial district to the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.976" offset="1171853">That was true under the World War II regulations where many of the orders sent to the registrants during that World War II period, just required that they report to the local board at that time, as I will explain a little later, the reporting to the local board was the first step in the trip to the public service camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.488" offset="1273940">Reporting to the local board now is not for transportation to a camp or for delivery to a camp, it's for the purpose of giving the registrant a -- a more detail explanation of what his -- the procedure he should follow in reporting to his place of work.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.540" offset="1402149">Now, I might say this, the order is couched as two orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.282" offset="1425032">But I think the -- the registrant is obligated to report to his local board, one.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.470" offset="1453871">Two, he is obligated to report to the -- to the -- work assignment which, of course, is usually some distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.956" offset="1495771">There is a policy at the selective service system, not to -- not to assign this conscientious objectors' employment in the local of their residence but to send them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.809" offset="1563167">They have a policy to usually assign the -- the conscientious objector to some work assignment, maybe, 50 or more miles away from the area of his residence which is usually, but not inevitably, in the locality of the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.671" offset="1650625">The second obligation that he has is a report from employment and relay the third which is comprise in this second order is to remain in employment for 24 consecutive months or until sooner relieved by the selective service of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.430" offset="1737665">In other words, this -- this order follows him and -- and exist as a -- as an obligation for the whole term of his national -- his work of national importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.115" offset="1812376">I will -- this is far different system than obtained during the World War II, which I'll get to that in just a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.147" offset="1852500">So, in other words, the first order obligates him to report at one place, the second order obligates him to report at another.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.982" offset="1899833">Now, this has, in other words, a two-fold thrust.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.015" offset="2040059">Mr. Chief Justice, that language, it has probably been relied on by the registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.856" offset="2075376">This is an explanatory paragraph which is supposed to tell the registrant in -- in simple language what his obligations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.588" offset="2126263">Now the -- this -- this language, of course, might be susceptible of a -- of such a construction as the registrants have -- have put on it if -- if for anything more than a simple explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.002" offset="2207974">Now, of course, there is always a duty to proceed whenever you are ordered to go from one place to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.119" offset="2248411">But we submit, and I think that an explanation of the -- of the present procedures will show that the only fixed duty is to report at the place of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.030" offset="2312046">There's always a subsidiary duty to proceed whenever you're -- you're compelled to go from one place to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.424" offset="2345691">A court subpoena, for instance, who obligates the person to whom the subpoena is directed to proceed, that's the only way that, of course, that he has of getting to the place where his obligation or his duty lies.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.224" offset="2868872">Well, I might just say this that one of the landmark cases in this -- in this field of -- in -- in this -- that concerning this problem of where venue of a crime of omission lies is the case of Regina versus Milner, an English case cited by the registrants in their brief and also cited in this Court's Anderson opinion and frequently cited for the proposition that where a duty to -- where the crime consist of a failure to act, then here lies where the failure occurred regardless of where the person, the violator happened to be when the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.104" offset="3080359">Now, going back to your question, Mr. Justice Black, Regina versus Milner concerned a -- one who -- a defendant who was declared of bankrupt and a -- an English court in one county served notice on this defendant to surrender himself to the Court in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.157" offset="3188611">The notice was sent to a -- a neighboring county where he was then located and where he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.017" offset="3224033">He failed to appear at the appointed hour of the Court and was indicted for failing to appear at the Court at the appointed hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.777" offset="3263007">The English court held at the place where this offense was committed, if it was committed at all, was the county in which the Court was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.899" offset="3315566">The Court said, assuming the facts to be as alleged, as soon as three o'clock came and the prisoner did not surrender at Birmingham, he committed the offense there.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.918" offset="3355585">Now, I think, this might be said to be the common law or the -- the traditional approach to this problem, of course, where we have a specific venue provision on the subject of contempt now.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.663" offset="3694550">The State of Oklahoma has a constitutional provision requiring that anyone going to work for the State, sign a loyalty oath which includes an -- a -- oath to bear arms for the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.190" offset="3764663">Now, many of these registrants, especially where they -- they don't select their own employment which they're entitled to under present regulations are assigned to state hospitals which presently have a great need for -- for personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.934" offset="3855673">In Oklahoma, it would be impossible, I would say, but -- now too much exaggeration to assignment of these men to -- to a state hospital because he couldn't take that oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.916" offset="5507657">The Section 6 (j) of the Act, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has referred to, provides that any person who knowingly fails or neglects to obey any such order, any such order from his local board, meaning an order which is -- which would compel him to perform civilian work from his local board shall be deemed for the purposes of Section 12 of this title to have knowingly failed or neglected to perform a duty required of him under this title.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.356" offset="5749342">Now, of course, our contention is the duty, after reporting at the local board in partial compliance with this order, is to -- to report for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.094" offset="5808274">Now, the registrants advanced the theory in -- in on this theory, they're somewhat sustained by the Patteson opinion that there is a -- that this form and the regulations in the Act obligate the registrant after receiving his order to report to proceed from the area of the local board to setout on the trip to the place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.405" offset="5945574">They -- by shifting the obligation to the travel duty instead of the duty to report, they attempt to shift the venue back to the area of the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.799" offset="6011193">However, the Patteson opinion deems that the duty to proceed to the place of employment was violated in each of these cases when the registrant walked into the local board at the time he was ordered to report to the local board and made some statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.413" offset="6093636">I might say that some of the statements that were made to the local board, well some -- very frequently, some of the statements that are made are equivocal at best.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.660" offset="6222576">The registrants concede, however, that this statement really a future intent was just mere evidence of such refusal that it wasn't the -- the crime but mere evidence of -- of an implied refusal to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.143" offset="9128542">Frequently, the state courts are called on to decide where the obligation to support inference lies.</text>
