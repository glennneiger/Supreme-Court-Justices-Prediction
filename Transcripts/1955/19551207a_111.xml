            <label>Mr. A.L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="16.043" offset="64157">May it pleased the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.901" offset="75546">This case, involves the laws of United States citizenship by a petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.927" offset="115670">He's of Mexican descent but he was born in the State of New Mexico when he was some two years of age, he was taken by his parent's to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.500" offset="157989">And he remained in Mexico until he was 22 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.156" offset="176588">By that time it was 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.610" offset="190380">He attempted to return and did return at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.921" offset="207621">District Court ruled that the petitioner had lost his United States citizenship on the ground that he remained outside of the jurisdiction of United States for the purpose of avoiding service under a statute which provide substantially that.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.404" offset="289541">The statute is Section 401 (j) if you -- Your Honors will find it at page 2 of our opening brief, our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.135" offset="328516">It is quite short.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.777" offset="339069">It is -- it was adopted by the Congress in 1944 during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.880" offset="363520">It appears towards the later part -- portion of page 2 of our opening brief and it provides that any citizen of the United States who remains outside of the jurisdiction of United States or leaves the jurisdiction of United States to avoid military service and may or shall loose his United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.436" offset="461740">The issues which are before Your Honors as the petition have used it are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.994" offset="499879">There is the question as to whether, in adopting Section 401 (j), Congress exceeded its constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.404" offset="545541">This petitioner, this boy was a citizen of the United States and not by naturalization, not -- not by grace of Congress but by virtue of the mandate of a Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.881" offset="611474">And so, there is posed in this case, the question as to whether Congress had the power to do it but knowing somewhat the course of decision by -- of decisions by this Court on constitutional questions, namely, as to whether Congress was within or beyond its power in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.796" offset="699141">I shall defer that issue for the last portion of my argument, for Mr. Justice Frankfurter and other justices of this Court, would remind me if I didn't, that this Court will reach that question last.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.914" offset="755566">We'll reach the question of the constitutionality only in the event all other issues have to be disposed of adversely to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.886" offset="791510">So, I shall travel that road to press for the issue of constitutionality, and what I like to call the highroad of my argument is last and turn to two other issues first.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.889" offset="843546">Another issue is, and not an easy one or could the Congress mean by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.677" offset="878655">What is its legislative history and more particularly, what did Congress mean by this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.680" offset="906658">In the light of an agreement between the United States and the Mexican Government entered into 1943, which agreement, Your Honors will find set forth quite fully in the Government's brief at page 29 and which as I say was entered into in1943, was acknowledged by Congress in 1943 and it appears in the 57 statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.812" offset="1051167">One of the question will be, whether or not this petitioner who did not leave the United States while we're at war, but who on the contrary was a resident of Mexico while we were at war, having begun his residence during his infancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.742" offset="1118877">One of the questions Your Honors will have to decide is whether or not he is covered by or is it well protected by the provisions of this agreement between our Government and that of Mexico?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.241" offset="1164957">And therefore, his conduct does not -- is not covered by and is not subject to the provisions of Section 401 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="301.299" offset="1205185">And finally, there is the question, as to whether or not in this case, the evidence is so clear and unequivocal and convincing I use a trio of words that this Court has used in the naturalization cases, in cases involving citizenship whether or not the evidence has a -- the sufficient clarity or is so clear from -- from doubt as to have warranted the trial court and the Court of Appeals which agree with the trial court, directing a forfeiture of -- of this boy's right to citizenship directing a forfeiture of the most precious right that any human being can now have on the face of the earth, the right to American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.590" offset="1382296">Let me take as I have listed the issues, the middle road first.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.166" offset="1396611">Namely, what did Congress mean by the adoption of Section 401 (j)?</text>
            <text syncTime="355.307" offset="1421166">And what is the significance of and the applicability to this case of the provisions of the agreement between this Government and that of Mexico, the terms of which you will find in the Government's brief in an extended footnote, not too extended really, on page 29 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.273" offset="1505071">Let me summarize -- I -- quickly and I hope accurately the terms of the provisions of this agreement between the Government of United States and that of Mexico, recognized by Congress and reported in the 57 statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.393" offset="1581558">In 1943, our Government entered into an agreement with the Government in Mexico, providing that the Nationals of either country, residing in the other may be registered in and may be inducted in the armies of the other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.309" offset="1661179">It was an agreement as the agreement itself provides, for instance, particularly in paragraph 9, which Your Honors will find at page 31 of the Government's brief, it was an agreement which we had entered into with the Government of Mexico, as the agreement itself says it was an agreement pertaining to military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.982" offset="1743830">It was an agreement entered into, as Your Honors will find in paragraph 9, for the common war effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.213" offset="1772774">And as I say, it provided in the first place that in American citizen residing in Mexico could register and be inducted in the Mexican Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.819" offset="1819272">Seems like an unusual agreement, of course, but when we understand what its purpose was, it was in a common war effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.450" offset="1853753">That was the reason for the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.332" offset="1865247">This petitioner living in Mexico registered for the Mexican Army so that he complied with paragraph 1 of the agreement which Your Honors will find on page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.967" offset="1919791">Now, let me hasten to add this, lest I mislead the Court, which I certainly have no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.441" offset="1941734">We are not urging that this boy complied with the terms of this agreement because he knew of the -- the existence of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.644" offset="1978514">What we are saying is that in point of fact, he did comply and he did do all of the things which this agreement said an American citizen could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.614" offset="2018429">Now, what are the other things which happened or which -- which -- what he did.The agreement further provides --</text>

            <text syncTime="540.642" offset="2162521">I will -- I will, Mr. Justice Reed, a little bit later, go into the some detail on the -- on the factual issues as to whether or not this boy's conduct was voluntary and the other circumstances with respect to his not serving in the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.828" offset="2227304">The only argument I'm making now is, that what this boy did was in full compliance of with the provisions of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.137" offset="2256457">I was going to say that the treaty further provide that it shall apply to -- to residents as permanent residents as distinguished in temporary residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.680" offset="2290625">That phrase doesn't appear in the treaty but the treaty says, "That students are not subject to it, that those -- that border crosses are not subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.318" offset="2325211">The officials of the respected governments are not subject to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. A.L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="585.170" offset="2340676">This treaty is at page 29 of the Government's brief in a footnote and extends over 3 or 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.671" offset="2366589">Now, the treaty further provides that when a --a citizen of United States is registered in the Mexican army, that information shall be furnished to the American Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.560" offset="2418207">That appears in paragraph 6 of the agreement which is on page 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.451" offset="2437747">And that applies equally where a -- a Mexican national registers in -- in the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.396" offset="2481528">The record discloses that when this boy registered in the Mexican Army, he advised the persons in charge that he was born in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.653" offset="2518518">In other words, then he made a statement which, of course, means that he was a citizen of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.068" offset="2540251">The agreement further provides in paragraph 9 and it is paragraph 9 upon which the petitioner places his chief reliance that either country in his discretion may request the other, that nationals of that country who are registered in the army of the other or inducted in may be released from that army and the transportation facilities will be -- will be furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.479" offset="2645891">There is nothing in this record to the effect that the Government of United States ever requested the Mexican Government to release this petitioner although the inference is available to the petitioner that the fact that he had registered for the Mexican Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.758" offset="2718929">And since he had stated he was born in United States that the information as to where he was and what he was doing was under this agreement available to the American Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.964" offset="2767830">And now, this agreement as Your Honors will note in paragraph 10, the last section of it which appears at page 31 was not only solemnly recognized by Congress but it was intended to be a meaningful agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.373" offset="2833450">It was intended to -- to help in the joint war effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.119" offset="2852467">It recites that it is intended to be for the duration and for six months thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.109" offset="2876395">Now, it would seem to us that this petitioner did know more, at least so far as I told the Court, than what he had a full right to do under the provision of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.685" offset="2934700">Now, the next question is, what did Congress mean when one, in adopting the following year in 1944, Section 401 (j), that's at page 2 of our -- our brief or at the very end of the Government's brief as Your Honors prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.178" offset="3012650">What did Congress have in mind when in 1944, it adopted a statute which we have to confess, on it's face is broad and which suddenly, on it's face, makes no reference to the agreement between our Government and the Mexican Government, entered into and acknowledged by Congress fully the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.284" offset="3125081">And so, we are required, we think, Your Honors, are required to take a look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.573" offset="3154233">Now, we think the legislative history to those considerable, helpful light on whether the Congress in the adoption of 401 (j), admitting the broad language of 401 (j), intended that that apply to a boy who had gone to Mexico in his boyhood long before the draft law, suddenly without any relationship to the draft law or whether the -- this is intended to apply essentially to those Americans in the United States in 1944 while we're at war, who were then leaving the United States in order to avoid military service.</text>

            <label>Mr. A.L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="839.951" offset="3359765">Well, I -- I can argue it for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.149" offset="3376588">I can argue it because in the first place, that we take the view that, however, clear a statute may appear upon its face, if the legislative history discloses a particular purpose and a particular objective and discloses other factors which where the only factors known to the Congress that the legislation adopted by -- by Congress must be read in the light of the purpose of the statute as Congress said was its -- was the purpose when the statute was adopted and in the light of existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.163" offset="3512633">Otherwise, Your Honor, otherwise the -- the Court or I would have to take the position, the position which I think the Government has to take that in adopting Section 401 (j), the Congress attempted to annul or to rescind the executive agreement made between the Government of the United States and the Government of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.192" offset="3596748">The agreement was there, the agreement continue in effect and we believe that the legislative history discloses that this -- the 401 (j) was not intended to apply to those who are subject to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.987" offset="3655889">I'll be -- spell that out a little bit -- a little bit further if I may where I'm just at this -- that point to my argument.In our brief, we have attempted to give Your Honors the legislative history of Section 401 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="933.897" offset="3735510">You will find it at page 23 of our brief and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.890" offset="3771559">The legislative history as we see it, and of -- with respect to this we find no dispute in the Government's brief is something like the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.374" offset="3813460">401 (j), first arose from a recommendation made by the Department of Justice to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.389" offset="3841463">That is, to the two committees of the Congress that were concerned in the matter.The Attorney General in his recommendation to the Congress, referred solely to Americans who were then departing from the United States for the purpose of avoiding military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.465" offset="3945848">Your Honor will find acknowledgement or accreditation of this claim of ours in the Government's brief at page 61, where the letter from the Attorney General to both the House and the Senate Committee is referred to, and where it appears at least from what the Department of Justice was telling the Congress that this legislation was aimed at citizens or aliens who left the United States for the purpose of evading military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.585" offset="4074266">And as Your Honor will find a little bit later on page 61 of the Government's brief, this letter of the Attorney General, this legislation was aimed at those who had crossed the border into Mexico for the purpose of evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.228" offset="4140826">Now, when this letter was submitted to the House Committee and the Senate Immigration Committee, as we indicate in our brief, virtually all that happen before those committees was that each of them took the letter of the Attorney General and submitted that letter as part of its report to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.733" offset="4230896">In our brief, we recite the colloquy in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.632" offset="4250436">We recite the statements made as to the purpose of this legislation by Congressman (Inaudible) who was responsible for this legislation on the House side, by Senator Russell who was the Chairman of the Senate Committee and responsible for this legislation on the Senate side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.868" offset="4323370">In both these report, there is only a reference to Americans who were leaving the United States for the purpose of avoiding the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.726" offset="4358896">And then in our brief, we cite further for what it is worth of an opinion by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an opinion in 1946 by the Attorney General himself in which this legislation in discuss -- is discussed and which again it is recited by these responsible administrative officials that this legislation is aimed against those who were crossing the Mexican boarder in -- after the draft was adopted for the purpose of avoiding the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.896" offset="4475507">Now, Mr. Justice Reed, I -- I stand here to confess that it may -- at -- at first flash and before reflection, seem that I am in a difficult position when this statute says, "Remain to argue that it -- that it doesn't quite mean what It says."</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.206" offset="4564741">But I do think that perhaps the resolution of the problem is as follows and decided upon you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.730" offset="4598909">That if you look closely into the legislative purpose and history of Section 401 (j) and if you keep in mind that just a year before, the Congress had enacted -- the Congress had approved or had accepted an executive agreement providing that Americans who were in Mexico might render their service to this country in a joint war effort by registering in the armies -- in the Army of Mexico that Your Honor can read the executive agreement and the statute together ignoring neither, and you can read it together by -- by ruling that this statute was not intended to abrogate or to negate or to repudiate the agreement but it was intended primarily and essentially and should now be construed as to those Americans who were in this country and who were running away from this country after the draft and in order to avoid the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.255" offset="4844983">Well now, let me pass on to another consideration and that is the lower road that I said I would travel with Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.967" offset="4875807">And that is whether, assuming this first argument of mine to be insubstantial and unacceptable to Your Honors, whether or not the evidence as such as to warrant an order adjudging the petitioner had lost his United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.505" offset="4953966">There were Justice -- Mr. Justice Reed you were asking if there were findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.156" offset="4964624">They were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.591" offset="4970266">There is a colloquy or there are comment made by the trial court after a very short hearing and Your Honors will find them in the record beginning, that is so far as the judge's comments are concerned beginning at page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.775" offset="5063053">Now, let me -- let me state to Your Honor, quite simply the essential facts in this case so that Your Honors can determine whether or not the evidence or warrant an order adjudging the petitioner lost his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.635" offset="5134524">As I said, this boy was born in New Mexico and was taken there when he was two years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.419" offset="5161587">His education was suddenly very meager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.145" offset="5180500">According to the record he went to a Mexican school up to the age of 10 or 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.107" offset="5208398">I mention some of these facts, now, because in a moment I shall also be arguing to Your Honors, there's some statements that he made to the Immigration Service were involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.389" offset="5249463">And therefore, the kind of a -- of a statement upon which the trial court relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.775" offset="5267017">And therefore, the kind of a boy, the kind of a man we have here becomes, of course, under Your Honors, under this Court's decision of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.919" offset="5303589">His education then is fifth or sixth grade in a Mexican school, 10 years of age -- 11 years of age to be more accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.184" offset="5336712">His father died and he had to go work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.726" offset="5350818">Work where?</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.368" offset="5357401">To work on a little farm in the remote agricultural community in Mexico, then his mother had arranged to use and made some arrangement with the Mexican Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.536" offset="5406093">What kind of a worker was he?</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.317" offset="5417169">Well, his testimony is that he worked planting, (Inaudible) planting and picking corn and peas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.517" offset="5449979">The trial judge said he wasn't -- didn't look to him like peon, like much of peon, but I submit that that is precisely what this boy was, suddenly so far as his occupation and education is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.716" offset="5506821">He lived some 10 miles away from -- from the closest small village.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.961" offset="5535765">And he was living at his home, at the home of his mother with some five brothers and sisters, all of whom were younger and all of whom he was -- he was supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.451" offset="5581740">There's an interesting bit of evidence as to the -- and amount of entertainment this boy was able to get during his living in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.471" offset="5617789">Up to the age of 22 years, when he came to United States, he had gone to two movies and the reason he said he had gone to only two is because his mother would not give him the money to go from his home to the village some 10 -- some 10 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.506" offset="5681946">So, we have a boy who is uneducated, illiterate, agricultural worker, living with his mother and under her control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.505" offset="5730011">In a moment, I want to tell Your Honors, some statements that this boy made which we claim were involuntary, when he was first questioned by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.051" offset="5768150">As a matter of fact, he made many statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.229" offset="5780898">He was questioned some four times by the Immigration Service prior to his trial in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.968" offset="5807856">And he made many inconsistent statements, but on one issue there is terribly consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.269" offset="5845055">And, that is, that when he remained outside of the United States while we were at war, he was doing it because he was under parental compulsion, because he was under the coercion of his mother rather than because of any free and voluntary act on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.755" offset="5914958">Now, let me spell out for you, if I may though I shall try to make this not too repetitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.816" offset="5939200">The numerous occasions in which he asserted and reasserted this parental compulsion, the trial judges as a matter of fact, said he believed what this boy said before the Immigration Service, much more readily than he believed what he was telling him in the Court, because said the trial judge, at that time he had -- the boy hadn't had the benefit of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.530" offset="6034077">He didn't know what his legal rights are and the likelihood is that what he said before the Immigration Service then was more accurate and truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.793" offset="6067096">Be that as it may, this boy was first questioned by the Immigration Service in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.823" offset="6099278">And on that first occasion, as we show rather fully -- much more fully in our reply brief than an our opening brief, on that very first occasion when he was questioned, without a lawyer, couldn't, of course, speak the English language, spoke through an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.886" offset="6163540">When he's questioned before the Immigration Service, he said, in explaining why he did, wasn't in United States during the war, he said, my mother -- he said at the first hearing, "I wanted to come to the United States in 1942, but my mother would not permit me to do so."</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.985" offset="6243892">Your Honors will find that on page 11 of our reply brief, the blue colored brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.894" offset="6271478">This is what he said at the first hearing, before a lawyer talked to him, before he knew what his rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.874" offset="6303451">He was ordered excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.998" offset="6311915">He wouldn't take no for an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.985" offset="6319856">So, he attempted to come back again in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.002" offset="6331977">And he was stopped at the border again and he was given another hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.983" offset="6347860">And at this hearing, he explained again to the Immigration Service why he didn't come back to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.656" offset="6374609">He talked of his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.185" offset="6380669">And he said, and this appears on page 11, also, of our reply brief, "She would not let me come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.616" offset="6410449">I asked her for permission but she would not give it to me."</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.567" offset="6426227">Here is a boy, here is a boy living with his mother and working on the -- on their own family plot, supporting his mother who had to have permission from his mother and who -- so -- so he thought in order to leave the family home and because his mother -- his father was dead, have been dead many years, because of the importance in his life of his mother, he felt he had to have her permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.032" offset="6544091">She wouldn't give it to him and so he -- he didn't return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.632" offset="6558511">And again at the same hearing, he explained that he remained in Mexico to comply with the wishes of my mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.716" offset="6590798">To him, to this Mexican boy, to this Mexican peon if you will, the wish of his mother was his command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.435" offset="6625698">And he listened to that command and he yielded to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.204" offset="6640744">And he may have violated his obligation under the Selective Service Act, but he was under parental compulsion in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.450" offset="6669793">He was preferring the wish or the desire or the will of his mother under whose control he was, all times, to obligations which under the law he undoubtedly had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.702" offset="6734785">And at the third hearing, again before he was in court, again before he had a lawyer, for to none of these proceedings except in court did he have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.335" offset="6773238">He gave the simple common -- the simple explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.295" offset="6789120">He had no money to hire a lawyer because he didn't have even enough money to go to a movie some 10 miles away during this -- during this period or and -- and later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.460" offset="6837812">And so, at the third hearing, and Your Honors will find that on page 14 -- on page 15, he said, "My mother did not wish me to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.254" offset="6872921">I obeyed her wishes."</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.943" offset="11379670">I think that he has not established his citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.931" offset="11403703">Let me try to answer the second half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.777" offset="11411017">What it was that was troubling this judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.133" offset="11424496">At the trial, this petitioner denied that he stayed out of United States to avoid service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.043" offset="11452082">He had admitted it before the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.107" offset="11464411">And those admissions were introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.023" offset="11476010">Now, the judge wanted to know, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whether or not the receipt of these admissions constituted affirmative evidence warranting the denial of citizenship or whether or not in point of fact on law, these admissions had only the quality of impeaching what the petitioner had testified to and therefore, there was no evidence either way and therefore under Baumgartner and Schneiderman, the Government hadn't carried his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.533" offset="11594083">Now, Mr. Grean succeeded in convincing the judge, the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.298" offset="11609130">This is one of the issues we raised in this case and in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.055" offset="11624176">That admissions are admissible not only for impeachment purposes, they clearly were that, but that they also have the quality and dignity of affirmative evidence sufficient to -- to carry a -- a burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.577" offset="11686243">And that's one of the issues which we think this Court may have to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.180" offset="11700663">Now, one final word with respect to the matter of proof and then I think I shall be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.457" offset="11729816">The admissions which the petitioner made before the Immigration Service were virtually confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.651" offset="11758550">And I want to talk about the Opper case, and Smith against United States and the problem of confessions, and the -- the quality of evidence which is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.084" offset="11804317">I would just say, Mr. Justice Reed, that when this boy admitted in the first hearing before the Immigration Service that he remained outside of United States for the purpose of avoiding service, it was virtually a confession because he was confessing to having violated the draft law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.519" offset="11870041">Now then, this Court seems to have decided pretty clearly that at least in criminal cases, confessions require corroboration and that both only confessions, Mr. Justice Reed, in the upper case said that admissions require corroboration where the prosecution is a criminal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.324" offset="11957290">Now, this Court has not yet decided and we think this is an appropriate case in which it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.644" offset="11982576">The question as to whether or not, where the proceeding is not technically criminal but whether sanctions are more severe than in a criminal case, the sanction of laws of United States citizenship, this precious, most precious of our rights, this Court it seems to me is now faced with the problem, as to whether or not it should not rule that in a case involving citizenship, confessions and admissions require corroboration just as this Court has clearly ruled confessions and admissions where the proceeding is a criminal one, require corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.099" offset="12128340">And if the Court takes that view and applies it to this case, then we say there has not been sufficient evidence to carry the burden, this Court has said in the Baumgartner case and the Schneiderman case, sufficient evidence to warrant the denial of a citizenship to one born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.896" offset="12215484">I had originally intended to argue the problem of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.319" offset="12241189">I -- I reserve-- reserve the right, if I may, to change my mind and to rely upon the argument -- arguments which appear in our briefs on -- on that subject and to reserve what remaining time I may have for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.774" offset="13115037">Perhaps, the sum of the Government's case, which I shall try to explicate some length, is found in the words of Judge Harrison at the end of his oral opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.448" offset="13157773">He said, “This plaintiff is an intelligent young man and he probably would have made a good soldier or -- and a good citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="4610.679" offset="18442658">Now, I come to the question of whether these -- these admissions can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.469" offset="18461780">I think there's little doubt and I won't spend much time on it, that they can be considered as substantive or affirmative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.688" offset="18494694">There was some argument made below that they should only be considered as -- as impeaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.956" offset="18511726">And that they impeached his prior testimony but then the Government was left with nothing at all and, of course, had not sustained his burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.172" offset="18540669">The universal rule is that they are admissible as -- as affirmative or substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.756" offset="18567001">And that's true in criminal cases as well as civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.341" offset="18581316">Then, the question arises whether corroboration is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.371" offset="18597407">And on that we -- we take the position, first, that corroboration is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.089" offset="18616320">And second, I will take the position that if it is required, it -- it -- there is corroboration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.815" offset="18647249">On -- corroboration has long been held unnecessary in almost every civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.211" offset="18664803">In every -- on the service civil case there are a few exceptions, mostly historical and some made by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.470" offset="18689776">But the -- the requirement of corroboration has been limited almost entirely to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.080" offset="18712242">Now, it is said at once, that expatriation is a severe penalty or -- or severe consequence of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.009" offset="18744007">And if the corroboration requirement should be carried over to that type of proceeding as well as obtaining only criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.281" offset="18781100">And to that, our answer would be that the Court had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.065" offset="18796251">That there are many cases in which the alliance is really twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.732" offset="18814851">The Court had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.479" offset="18821851">And second, that the higher standard, the clear convincing, unequivocal standard is intended to attain the same result without the adoption of a mechanical rule such as a corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.745" offset="18882978">I said the Court has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.377" offset="18893427">Denaturalization, expatriation, deportation cases have been before this Court many, many times and the Court has refused to carry over to those cases the -- the various rules which do apply in -- in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.783" offset="18951105">The rules against self-incrimination, I mean the Court has held that inferences can be made from the silence of the accused if he's called upon to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="4754.774" offset="19019024">The Court has applied the Rules of Civil Procedure in -- in denaturalization cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.683" offset="19046713">There has been no tradition of carrying over into this field the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.532" offset="19082031">Congress itself has adopted -- has put into the statute of the Immigration law, provisions, allowing deportation just on the base of admissions alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.869" offset="19127380">It's long been the rule of the country that if an alien admits that he was guilty of a crime involving moral turpitude after entry or before entry, he is -- he is deportable, admits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.000" offset="19175967">And those have always been interpreted as -- as had been applied administratively and judicially as allowing for deportation on his sole, uncorroborated admission.</text>

            <text syncTime="5631.719" offset="22526851">The statute says he must stay away for the purpose of avoiding the draft.</text>

            <text syncTime="5650.586" offset="22602292">And I would suppose that if -- if he stayed away for that purpose, if that is here, that that you couldn't prove under the statute because I think, you'd have to constrict very strictly as you would a critical statute.</text>
