          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.097">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. MacGuineas, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="9.097" stopTime="230.082">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.097" offset="36362">In addition to the argument which I have advanced that the plain words of the statute contemplate the presidential authority to extend the Act throughout the entire executive branch of the Government, we think we have here a strong case of legislative ratification even if there were initial doubts as to the President's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.525" offset="130090">Section 3 of the Act provides that if the President shall extend it to other departments and agencies, he shall so notify the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.422" offset="185678">And on the day that the President issued the executive order, he wrote a letter to the chairman of each of those committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.615" offset="214413">That letter is not in the record or briefs and, with the Court's indulgence, I should like to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.223" offset="232803">It's quite short.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.283" offset="241058">The President said, “I have, today, issued an executive order entitled 'Security Requirements for Government Employment.'</text>
            <text syncTime="69.147" offset="276584">This order extends the application of the provisions of the Security Act of August 26, 1950 to all executive departments and agencies of the Government to which it has not heretofore been applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.182" offset="336666">In accordance with Section 3 of the Act, I hereby notify the Armed Services Committee that I deem my action necessary in the best interest of national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="95.432" offset="381701">So, Congress was put on notice in the formal way contemplated by the statute itself, that the President had construed his authority as embracing his right to extend the Act to the entire executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.366" offset="441365">Congress took no action in contravention of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.087" offset="468323">Furthermore, as the Court well knows, this security program has been a matter of much wide publicity and much public controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.447" offset="509701">Indeed, there have been two extensive investigations of the program by committees of Congress at which lengthy hearings were printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.221" offset="552856">In addition and more specifically, when the 1954 Appropriation Act for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State were under consideration, those Acts were reported out of committee having in them the so-called McCarran Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="635716">That was a rider which had been included since 1946 in that Appropriation Act which gave the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State the absolute discretion to dismiss any employee in the interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.703" offset="718785">In the debates on this bill, Public Law 733, there was extensive discussion particularly in the House as to the relationship between the McCarran Rider authority and the extension authority given under Section 3 of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.684" offset="802691">And, because it was felt that the whole security problem of the Government would be encompassed within this statute, the McCarran Riders were stricken from the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.107" offset="868415">So, taking all of those factors into consideration, it seems to us that there is here a plain case of Congress as having ratified the President's interpretation of the bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.242" offset="932885">Do you -- do you argue, Mr. MacGuineas, that the President did or did not change the standard for separation from service?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="242.558" stopTime="376.604">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas</label>
            <text syncTime="242.558" offset="970188">Yes, I should like to take that up right at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.714" offset="990772">In the first place, the Court may be under a misapprehension as to what the executive order actually provides, with all due deference to opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.125" offset="1040405">I think his statement of that was not entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.691" offset="1054720">The provision of the executive order which governs the action here taken, to wit, the termination of this employee from his position is Section 6, quoted in our brief on appendix, page 8 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="286.972" offset="1147820">The Court rule observed that that provides that, if information is developed indicating that the employment of any officer or employee may not be clearly consistent with the interest of the national security, the head of the department may or shall immediately suspend the employment of the person if he deems such suspension necessary in the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.509" offset="1257953">And, I call to the Court's attention that that fact, the critical finding which he must make in order to suspend an employee, is in the precise language of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.961" offset="1307794">And then, Section 6 goes on to say that, following review, the head of the agency shall terminate the employment of such suspended officer or employee whenever he shall determine such termination necessary or advisable in the interest of national security in accordance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.375" offset="1397447">And, there, again, the executive order uses the precise language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.608" offset="1422420">So, as we read the executive order, with respect to termination which is the only executive act involved in this case, there cannot be even an argument that there has been an application of a difference or a contrary standard from that prescribed by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.647" offset="1586573">Is that in the words of the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="398.070" stopTime="709.419">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas</label>
            <text syncTime="398.070" offset="1592216">That is not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.028" offset="1596082">That is in the words which are elsewhere used in the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.869" offset="1619383">They are used in the preamble of the statute, they are used in Section 7 of the Executive Order which deals with the conditions under which an employee who has been terminated may be reinstated, and they are also used in Section 8 of the Executive Order which sets forth various factors which shall be considered in connection with the investigation of an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.926" offset="1735680">Now, Your Honor's question, I think, leads to the issue raised by petitioner as to whether granting that the secretary has used this language clearly consistent with the national security whether the secretary has used a different standard or conflicting standard with that prescribed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.503" offset="1841946">In our view, it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.252" offset="1860963">Congress chose not to offer the executive or the Courts any definition whatever of the phrase “necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="480.782" offset="1923030">Bearing in mind that we are here dealing, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, with the control of the executive personnel, a function vested by the constitution in the President, a function perhaps more completely internal to the executive branch of the Government than any other functions, we think -- and bearing in mind further that the administration of the Act in the sense of deciding the case of a particular employee is vested in cabinet officers whose relationship to the President is, of course, perfectly obvious, bearing all of those factors into account, we think it would be highly unrealistic to construe this Act as meaning that Congress meant that the Chief Executive acting in this executive field could not offer guidance and interpretation to his chief assistants in the administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.133" offset="2192509">Indeed, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, and we agree, if the Act were otherwise construed, we think there would be a constitutional question as to its validity as infringing upon the President's executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.376" offset="2257502">We think the Act is not to be given such a construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.322" offset="2273280">Now, before the recess, some comments were made as to the supposed extreme difficulty of an employee's meeting this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.473" offset="2325838">Again, we by no means agree with the characterization of this standard which has been given by counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.439" offset="2361678">In fact, this standard cannot be so difficult to apply or for employees to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.436" offset="2389682">The truth is that something over two million Government employees have already passed the standard successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.911" offset="2447569">It -- it does not seem to us that there, in using the words “clearly consistent with the national interest,” even if, as I say, that be assumed to be applicable to the termination here, that the President has imposed a more onerous burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.011" offset="2516010">I do not read those words as imposing a burden of proof, one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.103" offset="2544327">If the President had never used the words “clearly consistent” and the head of the department in a particular case was left entirely to the discretion vested in him to take action deemed necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security, I submit that that department head would be free under that definition to say “I shall determine that the interest of national security require that no person will be retained in my department unless he convinces me by the strongest type of evidence that his retention will be consistent with the national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="674.507" offset="2697927">I don't say that an executive head did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.519" offset="2710047">I say that such a standard could be laid down by a department head under the general discretionary phrase used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.182" offset="2756650">So, I think there is no basis for assuming that, in application, the use of the clearly consistent standard has resulted in the imposition upon employees of a more difficult test or more difficult burden of proof than would have existed had those words never been used at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas</label>
            <text syncTime="944.010" offset="3775948">Well, we -- we don't reach that issue in this case because of the question as to the application of the Veterans' Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.971" offset="3803847">We do not cast any doubt upon the validity of the Veterans' Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.626" offset="3822446">Now, if the Veterans' Preference Act is applicable to petitioner, confessedly, he was not given the procedure prescribed by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.553" offset="3866122">So, if the Court were to conclude that this man was dismissed under a test which is inconsistent, in conflict, with the statute, Public Law 733, I assume it was then conclude that the petitioner had not validly been taken out from under the protection of the Veterans' Preference Act and that his dismissal was, for that reason, improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.494" offset="3989943">Now, the final question which petitioner raises is that the letter of dismissal does not, as he terms it, state the reasons for the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.809" offset="4043233">And, the short answer to that is, like petitioner's earlier arguments, he is reading something into the statute that just is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.806" offset="4083148">The statute does not impose any requirement that the decision shall state the reasons therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.347" offset="4117316">The only reference in the statute that, again, if the Court wishes to refer to the appendix to our brief, is at page 2 (a) where it says that to the extent that the interest of the agency head determines that the interest of the national security permit, the employee concerned shall be notified of the reasons for his suspension and, within 30 days, shall have opportunity to answer, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.285" offset="4245107">Now, that contemplates that the so-called letter of charges shall state the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.891" offset="4279484">In other words, “you are being suspended for such and such reasons to the extent that security considerations permit the state under those reasons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.295" offset="4317100">And, it is significant that when we come to the termination language in this Act, Congress did not say anything about giving the employee the reasons for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.870" offset="4355448">It merely said give him a written statement of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.946" offset="4379690">Now, that distinction between reasons and decision is not unique in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.185" offset="4412709">It is also to be found in the Civil Service law, the so-called Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, which prescribes procedure for the dismissal of the employees in the Classified Civil Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.465" offset="4461819">It is also to be found in the Veterans' Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.540" offset="4478119">Each of those laws provides that the employee shall be given a statement of the reasons when he is given the charges so that he may prepare his defense to the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.328" offset="4533290">But, neither of those statutes in terms, as by this law, provides that the decision -- the ultimate decision as to whether or not the man shall be fired shall contain any statement of the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.802" offset="4595148">There is only one case on that point which is relied on by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.539" offset="4614060">That's the Court of Appeals decision in the Mulligan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.361" offset="4629420">That was a civil service dismissal and the Court said that he, there, must be given the reasons for the decision because the Civil Service Commission, by regulations with respect to that type of dismissal, has explicitly said that the decision shall give the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.973" offset="4707892">So, petitioner's argument is that where the law or the regulations specifically says the decisions will contain the reasons, that that is -- that result also follows where the law does not specifically say that the decision shall contain the reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.153" offset="7400594">Number IN203, July 1953, which provides, “The executive order further provides that the head of each agency shall suspend and terminate in accordance with the Act of August 26, 1950 the employment of any person whose retention in employment would not, under the standards of Executive Order 10450, be clearly consistent with the interests of national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.885" offset="7559523">Your Honors, I call the Court's attention to the respondent's appendix wherein they set forth completely Executive Order 10450, page 5 (a) of that appendix where they set forth Section 2 of the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.078" offset="7640294">And, when they say, as my learned adversary has said, that Mr. Cole was dismissed under Section 6 of the Executive Order, I submit that that is not so because, on page 5 (a), we have Section 2 of the Executive Order which provides that the head of the each department and agency of the Government shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining within his department or agency an effective program to ensure that the employment and retention in employment of any civilian officer or employee within the department or agency is clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.920" offset="7823673">Let's then go over to 9 (a), excuse me, Your Honors, 8 (a) and 9 (a) of their appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.043" offset="7864111">And, if we go down to the bottom of page 8 (a), we see Section 7 which reads, and this I think is crucial, “any person whose employment is suspended, not terminated yet, but suspended,” as was Mr. Cole, “or terminated under the authority granted to heads of departments and agencies, by or in accordance with said Act of August 26, 1950 or pursuant to Executive Order 9835 or any other security or loyalty program relating to officers or employees of the Government, shall not be reinstated,” that means from the position from which the employee was suspended, “or restored,” that means from the position from which the employee had been terminated as distinguished from suspension, “to duty or reemployed in the same department or agency and shall not be reemployed in any other department or agency unless the head of the agency -- of the department or agency concerned finds that such reinstatement, restoration, or reemployment is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, etcetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.321" offset="8169221">I think, and I believe that this Court will think, that, on the basis of the language of the executive order itself, it is Section 7 of this order and not Section 6 which is the basis for the determination that Mr. Cole's continued employment was not clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.909" offset="8267546">And, page 21 of the record clearly establishes that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.251" offset="8284996">The Secretary never made a determination that Mr. Cole's continued employment was neither necessary nor advisable in the national security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.475" offset="8321881">She made a determination that his continued retention in employment was not clearly consistent with that security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.431" offset="8353646">And, that Your Honors, is the crucial standard upon which Mr. Cole's termination was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.791" offset="8375066">It was not contained in Section 6 of the order but was contained directly in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.316" offset="8401189">We think that the guides for members of Security Hearing Board, established by the United States Civil Service Commission, a commission which certainly is supposed to be the expert body in this field with respect to this particular business, has said and interpreted this executive order as saying “yes, when a man is suspended he must be suspended but, thereafter, terminated under the clearly consistent standard of the provisions of the executive order and not under the necessary or advisable standards established by the Congress.”</text>
