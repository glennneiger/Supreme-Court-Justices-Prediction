            <label>Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel</label>
            <text syncTime="28.709" offset="114834">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.193" offset="132702">This case arises out of a prosecution for income tax frauds, at which the Government sought to convict the defendant and succeeded on the basis of the net worth expenditure theory with which this Court is familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.768" offset="206994">And the problems which arise in that connection are not here since this Court has limited our certiorari to the one point arising out of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.736" offset="254851">The -- prior to the trial, the defendant had moved for an inspection of the grand jury minutes and to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the saying was not based on any evidence, that motion was denied on the ground that the papers were not sufficiently specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.166" offset="336562">At the trial, defendant's counsel announced his intention of establishing there what he had not been able to establish previously, and began questioning each witness who appeared at the trial, whether or not that witness had also testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.406" offset="417541">And in the beginning, the Government objected and the objection was sustained, but the summaries are not disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.530" offset="446067">The Government did not persisted its objection, and therefore, all of the witnesses were asked, because one of the witnesses as to whom the objection was originally sustained was later allowed to answer the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.693" offset="510746">All of these were asked, whether or not, they had testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.976" offset="527882">And it transpired that no one of the witnesses who produced the large record, which is before Your Honors, had testified before the grand jury who had had any personal transaction to whatsoever with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.240" offset="584934">Not even with the one government agent by name of her own name who had -- had a conversation with defendant which is in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.409" offset="621610">And there are only three persons of all those witnesses had testified before the grand jury who were all government agents who testified at the trial as experts basing their testimony there of course, on the testimony which had previously been given at the trial by various individuals who have had personal transactions with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.750" offset="706978">And on the basis of that proof, the defendant again at the trial moved the application to dismiss the indictment which we denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.450" offset="737698">In the Court of Appeal, Judge Hand characterized the testimony at the trial by saying, those who had appeared and had had no personal acquaintance with Costello or his affairs, they were accountants or experts, and we find it impossible to escape the conclusion that their computations must have been based on hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.553" offset="838113">Now -- as we view, this case it rests on three rather simple propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.574" offset="866220">First, the man of the Constitution for a prosecution of this character and there's no question that this prosecution comes within it's power to describe in the Constitution as infamous because of the nature of the punishment permissible must be prosecuted by indictment means more than a formal claiming of an indictment, a mere piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.377" offset="973427">And secondly, that that means that there must be before the grand jury some substantial competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.736" offset="1014909">And third, that there must be a remedy in case such a requirement be not complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.725" offset="1046883">The only available remedy in view of the fact that an application to dismiss an indictment is interlocutory or not appealable, the only available remedy is, therefore, after conviction, it must result in a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.433" offset="1097665">And we think those views having been well expressed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in Estelle, the Estelle case which we have cited on our brief although this quotation does not appear there.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.148" offset="1140506">I'm referring to an almost identical provision of the Oklahoma Constitution, that Court said, “This section of the Constitution does not mean an accusation in the form of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.367" offset="1193378">It does mean, a presentment or indictment found and returned by a grand jury, legally selected, impaneled and sworn, and upon competent evidence is authorized by law, and a trial of a person for such crime, without an indictment thus found is in violation of constitutional right and void.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.972" offset="1295882">Rather, concept that a grand jury should act on competent evidence, to the exclusion of hearsay, is one well found in American law.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.453" offset="1357740">As early as 1831, the then Solicitor General of Massachusetts, Daniel Davis, in a book called, “Precedents of Indictments” published that in Boston said, “That it is a rule without an exception, that no evidence can be admitted or received by the grand jury which would not be admitted on the trial of the defendant, such as hearsay evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="367.299" offset="1469127">And that thought has been voiced on numerous occasions, by Mr. Justice Field in a charge to the grand jury in California, by a judge in Boston, by another judge in California more recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.183" offset="1524715">It has been voiced in statements in numerous federal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.785" offset="1551047">It has actually resulted in the reversal of convictions and the question of indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.079" offset="1596291">It is true that in several of the cases in which that result followed, the objection was not on the basis of hearsay are such but on the basis of other disqualification or incompetence of the evidence before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.050" offset="4296098">We'd have to take the cases as we find them, and the cases indicate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.429" offset="4329639">In the federal courts, there has been a consistent statement of opinion in almost all of the Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.180" offset="4364643">That the evidence before the grand jury must be competent and that an indictment should not rest solely on incompetent or hearsay evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.064" offset="4436219">Generally, in terms of hearsay, I never specifically in the terms of a limited variety of hearsay because that hasn't arisen, in the states, there is a considerable variety of expression, but almost no case which actually decides contrary to the position for which we are here contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.450" offset="4533708">And a number of cases which expressly adopt the point of view for which we are contending and to rest it not as the Government would seek that the Court believe because of particular state statutes although such do exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.133" offset="4592431">But because of the state courts' belief, that the constitutional requirements compelled the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.607" offset="4618344">Thus, in New York, where there is a statute expressly limiting the grand jury to competent evidence and excluding hearsay, and where the courts have quashed indictments based on hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.108" offset="4668395">The Court of Appeals has pointed out that that is a rule based on the constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.344" offset="4717296">This power, said the Court, is based upon the inherent right and duty of the courts, to protect the citizens in his constitutional prerogatives and to prevent oppression or persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.387" offset="4765466">It is a power which the legislature couldn't curtail nor abolish, and to the extent that legislative enactments are designed to affect either of these ends, they are unconstitutional, and that was said in connection with an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.973" offset="4819801">That, New York law permitted an indictment to be quashed only on certain grounds and this was not among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.153" offset="4844565">Now, in several of the states that you -- has not been followed and statutes limiting the quashing of indictment had been strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.310" offset="4889182">And in other states, the courts have simply said, “We will not concern ourselves with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.139" offset="4904542">We will make no inquiry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.847" offset="4915304">But we know of no case where the facts have been developed, where a court has refused to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.288" offset="4945084">Now, in Alabama, in New York, in Oklahoma, there are precise decisions, reversing convictions or quashing indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.936" offset="4979670">In several other states, such as California, Chief Justice knows the method is approached in a somewhat different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.480" offset="5021884">They -- they are used through a prohibition as the basis for an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.063" offset="5052186">Now, the extent of the inquiry permitted there is a great deal from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.325" offset="5077264">But in no state where the general principle is accepted, is there a denial of some right of inquiry?</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.480" offset="5113835">Now here, that problem does not necessarily arise because we submit that the facts had been exposed sufficiently by what occurred at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.817" offset="5163259">And that we have here somewhat the same kind of a situation as exist in connection with illegal searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.398" offset="5201502">Now, that this Court can well lay down a rule similar to the one there involved, recognizing as it was stated only this morning here, that in the supervision of federal courts, this Court adopts principles that are not necessarily coexistent with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.673" offset="5298678">So that, just as there has been held a remedy can be devised to determine whether or not evidence has been obtained with the result of an illegal search and seizure or unlawful wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.236" offset="5360849">The conviction based on the use of such illegally obtained evidence will be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.729" offset="5382896">So here this Court, can likewise rule, but unless there is competent evidence before a grand jury, the conviction so obtained cannot stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.052" offset="7920118">I plan to devote the bulk of these oral presentations to what I hope will be answers to questions put by Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.970" offset="7963794">I'm anxious that the Court didn't have a concrete picture of what was proved at the trial in this case, and what we know or must necessarily assume was before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.628" offset="8026488">Now, in this four-volume record, you have the record of a five week trial that reflects the most painstaking, laborious, detailed kind of investigation extending over months and years into the Court long and difficult to ascertain financial affairs of Mr. Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.570" offset="8126276">This case is a careful structure of hundreds and hundreds of little bits of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.836" offset="8155324">No one or 10 or 50 of which are in themselves at all incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.645" offset="8182491">No one or 10 or 50 of the 140 witnesses at this trial could have established the Government's case against Frank Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.933" offset="8223660">It is plain as day from the most cursory examination of this case that this is not a case where the Government with hope and suspicion only went before a grand jury to get an indictment hoping to get the evidence later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.283" offset="8289071">It is clear as day that the evidence was all known and all had been carefully sifted before the Internal Revenue Service recommended prosecution, Department of Justice agreed with that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.965" offset="8343824">And the grand jury believed on the presentation made before it that Costello should be brought to trial for attempted tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.632" offset="8382485">Now, leaving aside for just a moment the testimony of these three agents about which I plan to speak at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.244" offset="8412891">What was there in this record?</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.143" offset="8420519">What was produced by these 140 odd witnesses?</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.440" offset="8437760">I'd like to turn again to the exhibits referred to by Mr. Fraenkel in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.655" offset="8470570">First, to page 42 of Volume 4 of the record, Government's Exhibit 363.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.811" offset="8511216">The Court will see there that the basis for the inference of unrecorded income is two things, a total of net worth increases in two of the four prosecution years, these with decreases, and very large annual expenditures by Costello and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.995" offset="8595958">You will see too examining this exhibit that the heart of the Government's case, in the sense of putting over and establishing clearly these huge excess and available assets, the heart of the case was the expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.491" offset="8777874">You will see that the 103 witnesses whose testimony is summarized on this exhibit, each in turn came from a store, a merchant, a dentist, a doctor, somebody who had received money from Costello or his wife for goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.014" offset="8860003">You will see that each item, practically without exception is a relatively small one, a few hundred dollars, some as little as $15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.096" offset="8904307">And you will see from this and from the testimony on which it is based that these represents a series of witnesses for some four weeks, one after the other, bringing through the trial jury the records from Macy's, in B. Altman's, and the doctor, and the maid, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.484" offset="8985913">In some cases they were not records.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.065" offset="9908245">Now, what did these agents know?</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.572" offset="9918276">What knowledge did they have to the grand jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.520" offset="9934054">Murphy testified, they had searched and located all the assets and liabilities of Costello and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.515" offset="9969998">They had circularized hundreds of banks in New York, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and brokerage houses to find where Costello had assets, and -- and this is important under the Court's recent net worth decisions, where Costello didn't have assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.690" offset="10050664">They had searched real estate records, to find what real estate, if any, the Costellos own, and they had found three parcels, not more an important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.242" offset="10104895">They had searched surrogates records and other pertinent records to find what inheritances if any the Costellos had have, and they found one small one and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.001" offset="10155990">And as the Court knows, the availability of nontaxable receipts like inheritances is an important question in this kind of net worth expenditures proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.731" offset="10206877">Now finally, these agents had tracked down all of these minute numerous expenditures of the Costellos.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.004" offset="10252016">The ladies and gentlemen, from Macy's and B. Altman's and the other places didn't accidentally show up at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.660" offset="10278557">They had all been interviewed and they were evidence discovered obviously by these agents, and Murphy so testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.423" offset="10321607">Now, these then was the knowledge that the agents had before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.772" offset="10346998">And I might interpolate here that I think there will be no quarrel with our assumption that the agents gave to the grand jury, intelligently and as fully as the grand jury required through its understanding, the knowledge they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.821" offset="10415229">On any other assumption, petitioner's case would go up in smoke because he has assumed and we have gone along with him that the agents could give the grand jury no more than they knew, and he says that what they knew was hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.243" offset="10480953">And what we say is, you have to assume by the same token that they didn't give the grand jury less than they knew, because the alternative would be, that even if all 144 witnesses at this trial had said, “Yes, we were before the grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.449" offset="10541767">If you didn't assume that they told the grand jury what they knew, then it would be meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.405" offset="10561620">And in every case, by the mere assertion on information and belief, the mere assertion of innocence and the mere suggestion that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient, you'd had to open up the grand jury minutes, a step which this Court has -- as recently as United States against Johnson in 319 U.S. rejected, a step which would mean that every case would be not only a trial before the petit jury but a retrial of a kind of nisi prius determination by a grand jury that the defendant would be brought to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.665" offset="10702576">Whatever the precedents are in a very few states, particularly New York, which Mr. Fraenkel has mentioned, it has been clear throughout our history and throughout the history of England from which we adopted our grand jury that no such procedure is permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.602" offset="10938305">Now, I might say only in passing and not to destroy in full the question before the Court that it is not at all clear to us that all these questions, even within the -- all these testimonies, even within the technical rules of evidence was hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.635" offset="11010508">At least, when the agents testified that we did this and we investigated that and we came up with these negative findings, there was no objection by petitioner's counsel on the ground that this testimony was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.298" offset="11073097">And further, as I've said, it was testimony that was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.426" offset="11089607">This negative testimony, negating other assets, negating cash at this turning point, it was testimony which was important for the net worth expenditures demonstration, the Government was making at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.759" offset="11146971">Now, even assuming that this evidence was technically within a part of that huge hearsay rule, we say that there was no practical, reasonable, common sense basis for holding that the grand jury could not indict on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.288" offset="11237146">Now, the only real practical objection or the only real difficulty that might have arisen in connection with this evidence in its posture before the grand jury could've been, first, were the agents stupid or careless when they copied the figures from Macy's and B. Altman's and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.472" offset="11313842">Or second, were the agents lying?</text>

            <text syncTime="5066.530" offset="20266109">It is a unanimous decision of this Court, opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.851" offset="20295367">Now in that case and I'm -- I might state at the outset the exact lines of my purpose in invoking this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.944" offset="20331729">This case, as we view it now, after reflecting on it, goes much further in upholding the action of the grand jury than does the decision of the court below and the decision we seek here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.483" offset="20401842">Briefly, the case involved this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.568" offset="20410201">There was a showing that the grand jury had before it incompetent evidence in the form of confessions unlawfully coerced and procured by unlawful inducements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.221" offset="20464849">There were threats and inducements which resulted in those confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.105" offset="20488359">And it was shown and the Court decided on this basis that there were these confessions before the grand jury and “very little other evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.538" offset="20526080">The nature of which was not specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.272" offset="20541022">Now, there, rejecting a claim that the indictment should have been set aside, Mr. Justice Holmes stated briefly, first, that this was a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and second and more important, that if objections of this kind were to be entertained, the abuses of criminal procedure would be enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.510" offset="20637989">Now, let me spell out which is all necessary, the significance of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.086" offset="20660245">There you had before the grand jury incompetent evidence of the most damaging kind, not merely incompetent because some dry rule of evidence made it so, but because a very fundamental constitutional policy made it so, evidence of the most damaging kind, evidence taken in violation of constitutional rights, and evidence in its nature inherently untrustworthy and no other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.357" offset="20781349">It's interesting to note for very little other evidence the nature of which is not shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.425" offset="20805695">I've looked at the record in that case and it's also interesting to note that the evidence of these confessions was attempted to be introduced at the trial and was excluded unlike the testimony of the agents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.336" offset="20873300">Now, we think it would be unrealistic in the extreme to doubt that the grand jury in the Holt case acted wholly or entirely on the basis of those unlawful confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.324" offset="20941218">Now, we have said, and I think we've lead ourselves be drawn into a hypertechnical trap that the case is not squarely implied because there was some other evidence alleged to have been before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.498" offset="20997956">We think now that the case is not only incoherent but it makes this case a fortiori, because it illustrates the artificiality and the impropriety of transplanting the rules of evidence from the trial jury to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.670" offset="21078622">Now, in the Holt case, if you have a petit jury at jury trial, and an effort to introduce those confessions as you did, and they had been introduced before the petit jury, over objection, the conviction would be reversed for the very good and substantial reason that in any sensible administration of this trial rules, because, you cannot know what improper evidence the grand jury may have a light -- the petit jury may have a light on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.546" offset="21202129">You have to reverse if evidence more than trivial was wrongfully admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.739" offset="21230864">But here, everybody concedes and the Holt case flatly hold that if there is some competent evidence before the grand jury, the fact that there are loads of incompetent evidence makes no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="5417.550" offset="21670139">Now there, the ultimate issue was one with which we're not concern but the majority assumed and Judge Learned Hand stated at length to his conclusion that an indictment that was involved in that case was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.087" offset="21736281">And Judge Hand based his conclusion on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.862" offset="21751432">First, that a grand jury had treated a witness oppressively, and second, and this was his clinching reason, that the grand jury had overwritten a marital privilege in accepting the testimony of this same witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.502" offset="21817992">Now there, if you examine the opinion, you see an application of a rule of evidence and other considerations, not mechanically, not simply laying against the evidence the rules in Wigmore, but sensibly, reasonably, and a determination that a grand jury had not acted reasonably and fairly, and that its action should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.639" offset="21934498">Now, that is a clear indication of an important point that neither Judge Hand nor his Brothers on the court below have suggested that an indictment under any circumstances with any kind of incompetent and unfair and unprobative evidence is always inviolable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.214" offset="22008790">That's by no means what they suggest for what they hold is that, merely to say that the grand jury didn't know it's Wigmore and didn't obey a technical rule of evidence is not enough to set aside its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.952" offset="22075768">And we say, that Costello has been justly indicted, fairly tried, and properly convicted, and found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a petit jury and in a verdict approved by two courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.467" offset="22137835">And we say that in these circumstances, in the circumstances of this case, to send the case back now, for a grand jury to determine whether there is probably cause to indict would enforce no substantial right and would in the -- in the language of this Court in the Johnson case, go far to make the grand jury upon in a technical game or rather than respecting it as the great historic tribunal of lay inquiry into criminal wrong doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5606.662" offset="22426645">Now, the very proof that there was sufficient competent evidence before the grand jury in the Holt case was that Holt was convicted at the trial, without the confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.861" offset="22483383">So obviously, there existed and I of course don't know whether that was before the grand jury in the Holt case, but there existed competent evidence other than his confession on which the grand jury could have acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.918" offset="22547644">And the opinion on the Holt case of course makes it perfectly clear that all the Court was deciding that it could not undertake to sift out the evidence before the grand jury, to determine whether the bad affected the grand jury.</text>
