            <label>Mr. Charles F. Barber</label>
            <text syncTime="14.574" offset="58201">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.661" offset="78576">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.968" offset="103863">It is an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.288" offset="117133">The question is whether certain Indians are liable for income taxes on certain income.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.930" offset="171677">Taxpayers here are full-blooded Quinaielt Indians, husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.109" offset="204382">They belong to a group of Indians who have become respected members of the West Coast communities in which they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.565" offset="246178">The relations between these Indians in the United States stem from a treaty entered into, between the United States and these Indians, in 1955 and 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.366" offset="301453">Pursuant to that treaty, some 200,000 acres of the Olympic Peninsula, along the Pacific Coast in the far northwest, were set aside for their exclusive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.622" offset="362475">This area contains a stand of virgin timber, largely citrus spruce but with the important quantities of Douglas Fir, Hemlock, and other commercial timbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.655" offset="422557">The income of these Indians, considered as a group, is derived principally from the sale of timber and from salmon fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.565" offset="470204">They derive about an equal amount from each source.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.394" offset="489535">In 1907, a plot of land on this reservation was allotted to the taxpayer husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.458" offset="529763">Pursuant to the provisions of the General Allotment Act of 1887, as required by the General Allotment Act, the patent issue to taxpayer husband, provided that the land, the fee to the land, would be held in trust by the United States for his exclusive use and benefit for a period of 25 years at the end of which the fee would be conveyed and this language is important in this suit, discharged of said trust and free from all charge and encumbrance, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.436" offset="713665">The 25-year trust period has, since been extended by a statute and the title to the land continues in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.553" offset="758178">Taxpayers' allotment contained a typical stand of timber that is typical for this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.431" offset="793704">A 1910 Amendment to the General Allotment Act provided for the sale of such timber at the request of the Indian allottee, with the consent of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.950" offset="859742">In 1943, the timber from taxpayers' allotment was sold pursuant to the statutory authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.296" offset="905091">And some $8500 was paid into his account subject to withdrawal by taxpayer with the consent of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.623" offset="954410">During that year, some $1500 was paid over to the Indian taxpayer for his use.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.401" offset="989518">The question in this case is whether the proceeds of this sale of timber, from taxpayers' allotment are subject to the requirements of the federal income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.174" offset="1060676">After a test case, brought in the Tax Court, by another Quinaielt Indian, similarly situated, had resulted in a determination that the proceeds from the sale of timber was taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.451" offset="1129744">Respondents filed a return and paid the tax about $300, calculating their liability as provided, or as was their option, I should say, under the income tax laws on the basis of long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.732" offset="1206857">After a timely claim for refund was filed and denied, this suit was brought in the -- in the District Court for the return of taxes allegedly, unlawfully collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.345" offset="1273313">We come then to the question of law involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.213" offset="1292852">The case arises under the income tax laws which comprehensively tax every individual on gains and profits and income from every source, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.330" offset="1357218">As recently as last term, in the Glenshaw Glass case, this Court had occasion to note that in these provisions, Congress had exerted the full measure of its taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.861" offset="1415419">Indians are within the scope of these provisions as respondent recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.632" offset="1446452">They are not exempted from tax as Indians or as wards of the Government by any provision in the income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.988" offset="1491905">Taxpayers based their argument here for exemption wholly on the undertaking by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.142" offset="1524506">In their trust patent, given to them pursuant to the General Allotment Act to deliver the fee to this land to them at the end of the trust period free of all charge and encumbrance, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.747" offset="1598903">They argue that these provisions confer on income derived from the land an exemption from tax and give their contentions a constitutional twist by arguing that they have a vested right in tax exemption given to them under a 1907 patent which could not be taken away by a 1913 income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.776" offset="1723037">They further argue that the collection of the tax in this case constitutes an invasion of this specific trust assumed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.300" offset="1777162">I'll approach this question in two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.150" offset="1800568">First, I'll review the sweep of this Court's decisions declaring subject to tax income of Indians in various situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.263" offset="1856993">Second, I will address myself more specifically to the arguments which are made upon this provision in the trust patent, the argument that is wherein respondents get out of this obligation to deliver the fee an exemption from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.172" offset="1964617">Addressing myself to the first question, the -- the broad question of the applicability of the income tax laws to Indians, I perhaps control most light on this question if I review the history of this problem in capsular form.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.586" offset="2050299">Indians being subject to tax as an -- as citizens of the United States, there are being no exemption from tax in the income tax laws, the question would be simplicity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.572" offset="2094184">But for the pervasive ramifications of a series of Attorney Generals' opinions in the mid 20s which found their way into some Court of Appeals decisions in the early 30s.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.587" offset="2154266">Now, I would like to put those into perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.264" offset="2172970">I'll start in 1913 with the imposition of the income tax or the enactment of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.935" offset="2211736">The early rulings of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue showed that from the outset, the Commissioner asserted that the income of Indians, without distinction as to whether from allotted lands or other sources, was subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.333" offset="2281326">I believe I am correct in saying that without significant departure at any time since the enactment of the income tax, the Commissioner's position has been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.872" offset="2343393">And that is this, that the income of Indians, whether restricted or not, whether or not from restricted lands, is subject to the provisions of the income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.918" offset="2395638">The -- I say without significant departure because such departures have -- have occurred, have been in specific cases, where in accordance with lower court decisions, the Commissioner, of course, was required as to the tax hears in question to abide by the results of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.897" offset="2487484">I mentioned in stating the consistency of the Commissioner's position that the difficulties that have come into this question arose from certain Attorney General's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.707" offset="2546730">These were decisions of Attorney General Sargent in 1924 and 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.242" offset="2564911">The basis of the decisions was that Indians as wards of the Government should be considered to be exempt from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.001" offset="2599915">It was consist -- it was inconsistent, inconceivable, the Attorney General thought that Congress, who, through history, had taken a position of protecting these Indians as wards of the Government would, at the same time, intend to exact a part of such income as they received in income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.496" offset="2701897">The Treasury at the time rejected this basis of the Attorney General's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.583" offset="2742230">The Treasury acquiesced only insofar as certain Indians, under certain treaty, not involved in the case of the Quinaielt, had written into the treaties specific tax exemptions in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.813" offset="2815164">A land was given and it shall be tax exempt for 25 years, or in a case with another group of Indians for three years, and thereafter, shall be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.146" offset="2864483">In 1931, a case came before this Court called Choteau versus Burnet in 283, United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.743" offset="2906906">There, this Court, in clear terms, rejected what had been the basis of this Attorney General's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.447" offset="2941701">It referred to the pervasive application of the income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.388" offset="2961450">That case concerned oil royalties from restricted lands paid to a competent Indian.Competent Indian is something that has meaning in the Oklahoma setting in which it arose, whereas to those Indians, certificates of competence were issued which carried with them certain rights over the disposal of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.136" offset="3056536">The Court noted that this Indian had full use of this money, it refused to -- or read into the restrictions on the land from which it's from any exemption from tax and held these payments taxable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.443" offset="7297672">This Court reviewed the reasoning of that case and said that the Court correctly failed to follow its earlier pronouncement because it was inconsistent with this Court's opinion in the Choteau case five years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.896" offset="7383562">Following this decision, we find an Attorney General's ruling withdrawing from his earlier wardship equals tax exemption concept and declaring that income of restricted Indians generally is subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.376" offset="7449496">In 1938, we find the Department of Interior informing in a -- official miscellaneous circular addressed to all superintendents informing them that Indians, just like other citizens, should file returns and pay taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.204" offset="7880725">The language I will look at is on page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.617" offset="7906429">The original act had provided for a trust to be held for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.028" offset="7932029">The amending act provided for the conveyance of the land in fee to an Indian found to be able to manage his affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.945" offset="7967765">And the language which respondents focus on is found toward the end of Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.579" offset="10186292">In all of those cases the income tax provides for the removal from the proceeds, the exclusion from the proceeds of such part thereof as represents the cost of production in the case of manufacturing operation or a return of capital in the case of a long term timber operation or a sale of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.472" offset="10281796">Now, in the case of the sale of the land or the timber operation, the capital gains provisions provide for the exclusion from the proceeds of the cost of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.076" offset="10412304">Certainly, it's late in the day to suggest that a tax on gain on capital -- on capital gain is a capital levy and not an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.658" offset="10466534">Your Honor will recall that that question was often one of the first cases under this 1913 income tax and this Court held that gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset was taxable, it was within the -- the scope of the income tax laws as enacted by Congress, it was not an unconstitutional tax as an unapportioned direct tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.639" offset="10578547">So, we think that whether the gain be derived from the sale of crops, from the sale of timber or from the sale of land, the question is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.423" offset="10697665">They say we acquired nothing prior to the sale of the timber.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.756" offset="11362952">Respondents sold the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.839" offset="11371311">Under the statutes, he has the use of the proceeds subject to supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.014" offset="11392000">Our record shows that he's made use of those proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.638" offset="11406524">His record shows he's withdrawn $1000 on two occasions for war bonds, $2000 for a truck, $1500 to complete in addition to his house, responsible expenditures consistent with the broad purpose of bringing these Indians to a position of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.652" offset="11494504">Can he mean them that the Government, under this General Allotment Act, has an obligation to keep him away from those funds and not to let them -- him use them for economic, productive expenditures, to keep the funds intact perhaps for his heirs, I -- I'm sure -- I'm sure not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.075" offset="11588232">I advanced the argument that way because I think it throws some light on the nature of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.870" offset="11623445">The United States has not undertaken it to prevent this Indian from enjoying the proceeds of his land or the timber for any length of time, or it is not undertaken to keep him from the proceeds of the timber until he enjoys the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.996" offset="11691886">The applicable statutes, consistent with the broad congressional policy of helping these Indians, take an economic role in our society provide for the sale of his land or for the sale of his timber and provide that the proceeds shall be subject to his use on application, thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.437" offset="11797734">Upon such sale, the trust and the obligations of the United States which go with the trust terminate pro tanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.108" offset="11844336">The United States on the sale of the timber discharges its obligation to deliver the proceeds -- well, the obligation which you would read from the General Allotment Act to preserve the property in trust for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.187" offset="11920718">And if the Indian, on the circumstances of this sale, realizes the gain -- realizes the gain, he's not taxed on any increment in value which is not realized, realizes the gain and has that money income available for his purposes or be it under supervision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.743" offset="13086929">There have been questions raised by counsel and by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.112" offset="13112424">They seem rather reasonable to me but unfortunately, our record doesn't cover them very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.493" offset="13137920">I would like to say a few words about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.690" offset="13154743">First place, I hadn't heard before that these Indians get about half of their income from fishing and half from timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.788" offset="13195076">It couldn't be true as to the individual, any -- given the individual of -- they're fishing Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.613" offset="13222452">They're wonderful fisherman who have log canoes and they can take them out in the ocean and they are experts with salmon and the other fish that ran there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.226" offset="13264875">But timber isn't something that a man can go out and take a log off of his allotment and carry them to the mill and sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.031" offset="13300088">It isn't a crop of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.055" offset="13308134">It's only a crop in the sense of hundreds of thousands of acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.324" offset="13325270">And when on the Olympic Peninsula, they tried to get enough land together to do that, there are formal agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.127" offset="13352438">There is one embodied in the statute, I understand it, whereby the national forest and a large private timber company or logging company can throw their acreage in the hotchpotch so that they can cut off enough per year to keep it forever productive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.384" offset="13437492">This is not tribal timber that we're talking about at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.966" offset="13451807">There's almost no tribal timber on the Quinaielt reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.806" offset="13467167">The reservation is almost 100% allotted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.020" offset="13483990">These are reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.462" offset="13493812">This -- this respondent and his wife lived at the very small fishing village of Taholah at the mouth of the Quinault River on the western slope of the Olympic Mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.901" offset="13559536">The discussion as to whether what is involved here was income derived from the land, those were almost magic words to the Court and I did want to say just a word about that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.547" offset="13638113">It was a phrase that was used a few times by counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.984" offset="13667892">Income from whatever source derive, says the Constitution and the Court as counsel has said, has held from a long time back that income can be derived in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.801" offset="13727138">It can be derived from the sale of timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.635" offset="13746469">There was not renew that the argument of statement repeated in several times in petitioner's brief that this Indian was engaged in the cutting and sale of timber, that is to say the logging business wherein one buys some logs and -- and they cut them and take them to the mill and sell them for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.464" offset="13837793">This Indian had his allotment cut along with the allotments, I believe, of 18 others according to what we're informed by Indian office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.162" offset="13888575">He gave a power of attorney permitting the superintendent to enter into a contract on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.317" offset="13917205">There was one contract covering a thousand 74 acres entered into with a logger, one who -- whose business is cutting and sale of timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.163" offset="13956598">That logger was the Aloha Lumber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.149" offset="13968509">The Indian didn't get the logs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.646" offset="13974570">This wasn't just a contract to cut trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.238" offset="13988885">This company bought the standing timber, cut the logs and hold them off to the mill itself, made what -- made its profit in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.384" offset="14033502">I am bound to admit, of course, that it is perfectly possible to make income from the sale of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.999" offset="14079896">You can sell a land and you can make the profit on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.055" offset="14092121">And I'm bound to say further that this Court has held all in such cases as with state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.559" offset="14122214">The Federal Government can't tax the income derived from them, but this Court long ago in Willcuts against Bunn way down the (Inaudible) that the Federal Government can tax the profit which is made upon the sale of state bonds even though the income directly derived from the bonds itself was exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.977" offset="14215837">Accordingly, more in the brief than in the oral argument in this particular respect, it has been urged by petitioner that while we're merely taxing, not the land itself but the profit which arises upon the sale of that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.192" offset="14300682">And I -- I would like to cover it since it is touched in this -- this is income derived from the land which we're taxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.325" offset="14337254">It's not at all the usual case where a man goes out and sells his land and makes a profit.You have another problem here entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.908" offset="14375602">You have reservation Indians who have never got that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.231" offset="14388872">It's true, they can get the land if they apply for a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.818" offset="14407262">And if upon review of their situation, the Secretary of the Interior says, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.035" offset="14436101">I think that you're entitled to a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.424" offset="14445610">You have now got along to the point where you've got a -- a truck and you've got a couple of war bonds and I think it might make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.439" offset="14477688">I'll give you a patent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.074" offset="14484271">You are henceforth competent and he could go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.537" offset="14498064">That point, so far, in this case, has been reached only to the extent that on some little applications, some money for beneficial purposes has been risked on this Indian, to that extent only has he got his capital to start out with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.643" offset="14562534">He goes out and makes profit on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.670" offset="14570580">So far as I'm concerned in this case, he's taxable on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.063" offset="14584163">It's like the reinvestment income which was concerned in the case of Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes which is relied upon so closely by counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.666" offset="14654589">The fact is that you do have, as counsel says, two policies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.442" offset="14689698">You have the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.718" offset="14694818">He adverted to the decision of the Chief Justice in the Glenshaw Glass case that, of course, the income tax means to -- the income tax statutes mean to bring within their sweep of all profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.920" offset="14759602">And in that case, this Court held that it would not exempt from taxation the treble damages that a plaintiff gets on a -- an antitrust action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.800" offset="14819161">That policy means to bring within it, but there is a policy of Congress which antedates that which is good right down the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.082" offset="14848313">It's been unchanged by Congress that the -- this land of the Indian shall be withheld from the dissipation which he might, otherwise, make from it until he's considered a good enough risk by the Secretary of the Interior and he is accorded his certificate of competency and his free patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.492" offset="14929920">Now, it is -- it's been said in very plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.123" offset="14944444">I believe that this language of the statute is scarcely open to question as to what the congressional policy is when it said that at the end of that time, when he gets this certificate of competency, he is to receive his land in free discharge of sub-trust and free of all charge or encumbrance, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.310" offset="15045172">Encumbrance is an ordinary way you can dilute or diminish the value of the land before the man gets it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.310" offset="15085192">Now, in this case, he used to get that land before he becomes subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.167" offset="15112568">Statute says, only thereafter, shall his land be subject to encumbrance, sale, or taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.741" offset="15146945">Now that being established, question is what happens to the proceeds of timber?</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.036" offset="15172127">Over a -- an Indian office in a letter to this individual which I've received on inquiry since I was very much concerned with some of the interpretations of this record, which could have been more specific, had the counsel foreseen what was coming, says that up from this allotment, this little 93 and a quarter acres of land, there was cut over three-and-a-quarter million feet of timber, marginal timber for which proceeds were paid under the Government account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.761" offset="15302949">Now, that is the trust raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.662" offset="15314547">It's the overwhelming value of that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.032" offset="15328026">Stamp ranchers can't farm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.819" offset="15335236">They have finally found out, it's a matter of common notice -- it's only partially supported by the record here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3855.275" offset="15421022">Mr. Justice, so far as this case is concerned, I've taken no position on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.602" offset="15442338">I can assume for the sake of my argument that they're fully taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.073" offset="15460206">If the Indian goes out and exploits his allotment, if he's got an allotment on which he can raise grain, as in Julia Nicodemus' case or that he can lease out for grain growing, as in Mr. Gary's case, both recent decisions of lower courts, the latter one in the tax court and the first one I mentioned of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.323" offset="15557277">I assume that they can be taxed, although, one court holds one light and the other holds the other in those opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.016" offset="15584026">It's ably briefed in this case by counsel for Julia Nicodemus, Mr. Delwel who has filed the brief and by counsel in the Taunah case in which this Court denied certiorari some years ago, Mr. Hill and those associated with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.019" offset="15659990">I -- I would rather permit those briefs to stand for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.380" offset="15673469">I assume for the sake of this argument that annual product of the land is taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.157" offset="15712549">The matter here of the proceeds of the land, the capital, the essential value of this land, go into the trust account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.940" offset="15763749">They stand in place of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.432" offset="15773675">Congress has said in support of what I urge upon this Court to be a perfectly valid policy for Congress to adopt that those proceeds are to be unimpaired, that the Indian is to receive them at the end of the time without diminution, which is what encumbrance means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.366" offset="15869388">It -- it follows as a result that until he's got that, he hasn't got the basic requirement for making a capital gain on this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.474" offset="15921842">He hasn't yet received the trust raise and the circumstances and under the conditions which Congress has provided as a means of solution for the Indian problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.373" offset="15965414">As gratified, they hear a counsel for petitioner say that he had become amazed that the complexity of these Indian problems when he gets into the peculiar statutes and arrangements that have been made which distinguished one tribe from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.519" offset="16034064">Most of us, and I suppose the way we're raised seem to think that Indians mean plains Indians with feathers and tomahawks and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.265" offset="16068963">The Indian cultures are as varied as can be supposed that's adequately covered by anthropologist who have written rather popularly on it like Ms. Benedict's "Patterns of Culture" comes to mind off hand, showing the extremes of difference in the Indian tribes in this country, where they originally have no name for another tribe which would distinguish him as an Indian like themselves, where they regarded another tribe almost usually as being as different from them as would be a white man from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.897" offset="16219533">They each present separate problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.824" offset="16231236">Congress did try a horizontal across the Board's solution of this in the General Allotment Act.</text>
