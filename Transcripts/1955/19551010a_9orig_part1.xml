            <label>Mr. Fred E. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="59.055" offset="236147">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.011" offset="252029">This is the case of Texas versus the State of New Mexico on Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District which is pending in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.802" offset="311171">And the matter is before the Court at this time upon the exceptions to the report of the special master filed herein on October 14th -- in January, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.528" offset="390060">In order to understand the exact issue before the Court, it's necessary to briefly refer to what has transpired heretofore in this case from the standpoint of procedure in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.791" offset="455158">The original complaint of Texas was filed and the defendants, the State of New Mexico, and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, in response to the order to show cause objected to the filing of the complaint for various reasons among them being that the complaint showed and the relief sought showed that the United States and the Elephant Butte Irrigation District were indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.488" offset="585874">Now, after that, the State of New Mexico and the Middle District answered and later the Court appointed a master, Honorable John Raeburn Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.045" offset="640104">And kept the question of indispensability of parties open, and referred that question to the special master with directions that he have a hearing and take evidence if necessary and report back to this Court his conclusions and recommendations as to the indispensability of the parties as alleged in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.803" offset="747207">The master conducted a hearing in response to that order at Santa Fe, New Mexico in April, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.049" offset="784196">And a report of the -- those hearings, together with his recommendations and conclusions, were on the file to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.239" offset="824947">I believe that those hearings embraced four large volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.166" offset="860578">Subsequent to that time, and after the master filed his first report which was in 1954, both parties, that is, the plaintiff and the defendant, filed exceptions to his first report.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.677" offset="942707">The defendants, the State of New Mexico and the Middle District accepted only to that part of the master's report that concluded and recommended that the United States was not an indispensable party on account of many reasons we urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.197" offset="1024731">And the Texas plaintiff accepted to that part of his report which recommended the case be dismissed on account of the indispensability of the United States limited to a question of the effect it would have on the rights for the Pueblo Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.942" offset="1111667">Those exceptions have not yet been ruled upon by the Court, but the Court referred -- but in that first report of the master, he suggested that the State of Texas be permitted to amend it to the prayer of its complaint further if it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.137" offset="1192542">And Texas then filed a motion in this Court to amend the prayer of its complaint so as to change the language and to find the relief to which she thought she was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.009" offset="1255967">And that this Court referred that matter back to the master, on Honorable John Raeburn Green, where directions that he determine whether the motions should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.117" offset="1304451">And if granted, would it cure the defect of parties which he had found to exist?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.921" offset="1343634">The master held a hearing in St. Louis on this last reference and filed his second report herein which concludes as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.554" offset="1434122">"I'm of the opinion that the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the prayer of its complaint should be granted and that if granted, it would cure for the time being, at least, any defect of parties herein."</text>
            <text syncTime="374.645" offset="1498488">Now, it's to that last report that the exceptions of the State of New Mexico and the defendant, Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District are directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.336" offset="1549270">I call the Court's attention to the fact that pursuant to the order made in this Court, sometime I believe in January of this year, acknowledging receipt of the last report of the master and stating that the parties would have 60 days in which to file exceptions if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.404" offset="1649580">We filed our exceptions within the 60-day period and a brief in support of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.690" offset="1674658">Up until this time, the State of Texas has not responded to our exceptions in our file to the brief in connection with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.542" offset="1946122">The United Stated has had ample opportunity to intervene if it so desires and the previous brief filed by the Solicitor took the very part of even definite position that the United States is indispensable on account of the -- the treaty obligations of the United States with the Republic of Mexico and on account of the -- the effect he thought it would have on the rights of the Pueblo Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.573" offset="2714227">And he found that none of those interests is sufficient to make the United States indispensable.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.536" offset="2874096">But we do specifically call the Court's attention to the last report of the master in reference to a matter that transpired in St. Louis when he had this motion of Texas to amend the prayer before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.879" offset="2935432">At that time, we contended that since the previous hearings, there had been some things transpired which made it clearer that the United States is indispensable on account of its contract with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District in reference to the -- of the El Vado Reservoir and the works of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.360" offset="3045355">In 1950, the Congress authorized what is known as the Middle Rio Grande project which was a confined -- a combined project to be carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.805" offset="3111184">And the --the Bureau -- the Bureau of Reclamation ought to do certain things, that is they were to rehabilitate the works of the district including El Vado Reservoir, they were to channelize the river down below, I'll refer to this matter in a moment, if I may, they were to channelize the river so as to get rid of the waste of water that had been occasioned by nature, by degradation of the river and the consumption -- non-beneficial consumptive use of water by plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.943" offset="3259768">And the Bureau's part of that project was to rehabilitate the Navajo Reservoir and Dam and to rehabilitate all the works of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.338" offset="3321313">And the original contract that the Bureau or Reclamation made with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District under the Reclamation Act provided that the District agrees that it will convey title to the works of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District at such time as a request is made by the contracting officer who is the representative of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.621" offset="3454433">Now, in our previous hearings on this matter, we've argued that by virtue of that contract alone, where the United States required the district to convey the title that that showed a sufficient interest in the United States and the works of the district including Navajo Dam and Reservoir to show that any injunction that might be granted regulating the release of water form or the storage of water in that reservoir would effect an interest to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.413" offset="3605629">But the hearing, the master and counsel for Texas took the position that this contract is contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.218" offset="3648784">It is an -- the title hasn't been transferred yet and it may never be because Congress may never make any appropriations to carry out the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.209" offset="3688803">We didn't think that was a sufficient excuse but that's the way the matter was left.So subsequent to that time, the United States has, as shown by the supplemental report of the hearing and before the master in St.Louis, executed a -- an instrument that is called an easement to all of the works of the district which I contend transfers the title to this reservoir up here and while -- to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.015" offset="3843971">And we claim that now, since the last hearing in St. Louis or at that time I mean, we offered this instrument and evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.967" offset="3879811">We offered another instrument and evidence that was in operation and maintenance contract between the district and the United States and the master overruled our offer for -- and first, Texas objected to it on the ground that it didn't go far enough but when we went into the whole thing, they had no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.352" offset="3985345">But the master overruled our offer on the ground that it was beyond the scope of the reference to him over this one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.085" offset="4024320">That is -- should the motion be granted and if granted, would it cure the defect of the parties in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.871" offset="4063399">But anyway, as we -- the master permitted the two instances to be filed and commented on them in his report and they are now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.588" offset="4110315">And we contend that those two instruments show definitely that the title to this reservoir that's involved which the injunction would operate against is in the United States, its property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.240" offset="4172904">And further, the operation maintenance contract which we put -- in a -- as in appendix to our exceptions in the brief, it appears on page 35 of our last exceptions in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.108" offset="4700369">Now, the contracting officers define in all of these contracts as the Secretary of Interior, he represents the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.682" offset="4734642">So, finally, it is that -- it has reached this point where any water released from that reservoir must be released under orders of the Secretary of Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.486" offset="6941884">That's all the rights Texas conceded at that time to Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.028" offset="9460088">Well, we -- we have to -- well, suppose, and prior with the compact and -- when there's so much water at Otowi, we're supposed to see to it that so much water reaches San Marcial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.089" offset="9504287">Now, in order to -- to comply with that, we take the position and it's an issue in this case that the compact never intended that if the -- the amount set up and the farmer did not reach San Marcial that that created a relationship of debt or credit between Texas and New Mexico because that farmer requires that it'd be computed every calendar year -- at the end of the calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.187" offset="9628735">And then it provides that when there is a spill in Elephant Butte, credits intended to wipe it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.882" offset="9651513">So, our position is that the few intent of the Compact was not to require New Mexico under in all circumstances to see that a certain quantity of water reached San Marcial but that present rights were to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.048" offset="9720163">The record shows that when this formula were set up by the engineers, it was suppose to protect present rights and it recognized that the United States was not bound by anything that was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.685" offset="9766661">So, we say that the Indian rights and the present uses at the time the Compact was negotiated in 1929, if you want to talk about debts and credits, the base should be deflected from the amount of water that goes to San Marcial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.013" offset="9840013">Otherwise, New Mexico in the middle area there is charged, for not only with the water she uses on land but with non-beneficial uses, an Indian use.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene T. Edwards</label>
            <text syncTime="3436.311" offset="13745215">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.077" offset="13764232">I was somewhat surprised that the statement made by Judge Wilson that his idea of a solution of this case should be that the State should enter into an agreement or enter into a compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.093" offset="13836330">The disagreement between Texas and New Mexico over water rights arose good many years ago and resulted in litigation in this Court whereby Texas sought to secure a decree allocating the waters of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.713" offset="13914802">However, while hearings were being held before a special master, the two States did get together and did work out a compact and then did some of the Compact and that is a Compact which is before this Court here today which Texas says that New Mexico will flee and deliberately violate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.939" offset="13999752">What good does it do to make a compact if you can't get the other State to live up to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.381" offset="14025456">Now, it's a matter of record here just what did transpire with reference to a precipitation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.905" offset="14071536">Just a few months before the prayer and the suit was filed, the New -- the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, on May 26th, 1951, actually got together and passed a resolution which reads as follows, whereas the terms of the Rio Grande Compact having been discussed and the members of the board being familiar therewith and whereas the board recognizes the responsibility of the State Engineer under the Rio Grande Compact but because of the shortage of water and dire necessity of the people of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.185" offset="14240705">Now, therefore, be it resolved that the policy of the board is to take care of the need of the farmers to the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District insofar as it's possible with the limited supply of water available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.948" offset="14295771">That is the boldest statement I think that has ever come to my attention of a deliberate notice that the party was going to violate a contract willfully and knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.795" offset="14343105">Now, that is -- is why we're here in Court now is to try to enforce the provisions of this Rio Grande Compact of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.680" offset="14386678">That Compact in its provisions, particularly Articles 6, 7 and 8 provided that the State of New Mexico should not increase its debits of water which was -- had a limit of 200,000 acre feet on there until it had been reduced below that amount and that -- that they shouldn't increase storage in reservoirs a built after 1929 whenever there was less than 400,000 acre feet of usable water and project storage, and that when requested by the Rio Grande Compact Commissioner for Texas in January of each year that they would release water from project storage at the greatest rate practicable, whenever there was, at the beginning of any year, a quantity of water less than 600,000 acre feet and that New Mexico should release that stored water at such a rate as would keep the amount in project storage up to 600,000 acre feet at the end of April.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.887" offset="14707461">Now, as this Court is well aware, it is the only tribunal before which the State of Texas may obtain readdress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.480" offset="14741838">Judge Wilson has cited that Act that was passed by Congress in 1952 authorizing suits against the United States for the allocation or division of waters of the river or river system or for the administration of that water but it does not authorize one state to sue another state in any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.132" offset="14836506">There is no authority for that except the Acts of Congress and the Constitution which test that in this tribunal here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.165" offset="14872660">Now, in considering the question of whether the amended prayer of Texas should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.093" offset="14912366">I think it's necessary to go back and look at the background which is rather complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.463" offset="14941832">In this connection, concerning the briefs, as Mr. Wilson has mentioned, he said the Texas had filed no briefs in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.722" offset="14986867">I would like to call the Courts attention that there have been 21 printed documents filed here to this date exclusive of the record which consist of some 1300 pages, and that New Mexico, in the beginning, advanced 16 reasons as to why they were indispensable parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.225" offset="15080803">The brief that was filed by Texas convinced the special master that New Mexico was wrong on 15 and a half of them, and decided on one half of those points that is the Indians within the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District as being an adequate reason for holding the United States to be an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.365" offset="15161365">He, therefore, recommended a dismissal of the case unless Texas amended the prayer in order to avoid that question or unless the United States intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.120" offset="15216431">Frankly, Texas didn't agree with the Special Master on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.991" offset="15231896">We thought that the prayer we had originally was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.651" offset="15254570">It is never been our conception that the right of a party to stay in Court depended on his ability exactly to ask for the exact relief to which he was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.294" offset="15313084">In other words, if we asked for a little more than he was entitled to or if he asked for a little less than he was entitled to, it shouldn't be a reason for his not being able to stay in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.255" offset="15356970">It -- it's always been our understanding that a party's entitled to their belief that the facts give him and 54 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Practice and Procedure provides that every judgment that's rendered shall award to the applicant the relief to which he is entitled under the facts without the necessity of that being set forth specifically in his prayer and not only that but we had a prayer for general relief to begin with and still have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.455" offset="15473789">Now, the question presented to the Court at this time is whether or not the amendment to the prayer should be permitted and whether, if permitted, it eliminates the question of indispensability of the Indians within the confines or exterior boundaries of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.936" offset="15563651">And as I say, I believe that in order to give a proper consideration to that particular question, it is necessary to go into the facts and consider the Indian rights as related to other occurrences which have taken place on them to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.363" offset="15665424">Now, as Judge Wilson has said, it is quite true that the Indians were such -- awaited along the banks of the Rio Grande for many hundreds of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.261" offset="15712967">I believe it's stipulated that they had been there 900 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.356" offset="15725401">They were there anyway when the conquistador has came up from Mexico and touched the Rio Grande little below El Paso and worked on at the river and finally in the Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.089" offset="15768346">They found the Mexicans there has been irrigating their lands by crude methods and by means of direct diversion from the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.613" offset="15810351">It was the Indians that thought the conquistador as how to irrigate and not the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.118" offset="15836369">The Indians have known how to do it for a long, long time and they still know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.023" offset="15856013">Now, that being true, the Indians had unquestionably, a prior right and a superior right to Texas and everybody else as far as their appropriations of water from the Rio Grande at that time were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.170" offset="15940650">That brings up the question of what is a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.200" offset="15960712">Now, under -- under present statutes in many of the western states, that is fixed by the acts of the legislature as -- as a method or means by which a -- a landowner boarding on the river can secure water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.195" offset="16024764">He can file his application asking for the right to appropriate 1000 acre feet per year for so many acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.340" offset="16053290">Well, in that case, then of course, there's no question about the amount that that -- the -- the applicant is entitled to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.480" offset="16081920">And when he has received that amount, he's not entitled to receive anymore, that ends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.510" offset="16101982">But in the Indian situation here, you have something entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.728" offset="16122880">Their historical right was not regulated by a statute but on the facts in the case and on their usages which have been recognized by the United States and New Mexico and everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.023" offset="16180036">As giving them a full and complete right to the use of the natural flow of the river to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the land or water and whether it's one acre foot, or two acre feet, or 10 acre feet, doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.634" offset="16258508">Those Indians have a right to the natural flow of the river for whatever amount may be necessary to satisfactorily and sufficiently irrigate their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.280" offset="16309081">And as far as Texas is concerned, there's no question about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4200.182" offset="16800705">That's -- that is the point to which I was endeavoring to arrive and there are a number of other considerations, I think, to be called to the attention of the Court before I reach that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.243" offset="16852950">And I was about to mention at this point, the federal filings of 1906 and 1908 in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.483" offset="16893910">Now, that was before the -- the territory of New Mexico became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.984" offset="16915853">It -- did not become a State until the year 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.839" offset="16935288">The Reclamation Act, as the Court knows, of course, was passed in 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.585" offset="16954305">The Act of June the 17th, 1902, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to undertake these various large reclamation projects in the area -- areas of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.432" offset="17009685">And the territory of New Mexico, the -- the territorial assembly passed special laws which had relation only to the United States and were not a part of New Mexico's general water code.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.538" offset="17086067">Those laws provided that whenever the proper officers of the United States applied to the State Engineer for the diversion of water that thereafter, that that water should not be subject to appropriation by anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.193" offset="17152731">That was the Act of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.756" offset="17166942">Under that Act, the United States for the benefit of the Rio Grande Federal Irrigation Project filed an application with the State Engineer of New Mexico seeking to appropriate 730,000 acre feet of water per year for the use of the project, and as a source with which to supply Mexico under the treaty of the May 21st, 1906, which is ordinarily known as the (Inaudible) Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.918" offset="17283657">In 1908, under a subsequent territorial enactment which also was limited strictly to the United States, the United States filed a supplemental application whereby it sought to appropriate all of the then unappropriated water of the Rio Grande and it's tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.320" offset="17385221">Now, Section 8 of the Reclamation Act provides that where water rights have been less secured for the purpose of irrigating federal reclamation projects that those rights are appurtenant to the land which made the project feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.246" offset="17472888">So, our position is that it seems absolutely clear, as a matter of law, that the filings of 1906 and 1908 were necessarily superior to any other filings under the State of New Mexico which took place thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.783" offset="17559092">Now, in that connection, also, it is well to bear in mind that the Enabling Act of 1910 passed by Congress authorizing the admission of the State of New Mexico in the statehood provided that the United States reserved the right of carrying out the federal irrigation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.292" offset="17665149">And that section also was incorporated in to the Constitution of New Mexico in 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.871" offset="17699422">So, there, we have the -- the federal authority for the establishment of those rights in the Rio Grande Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.584" offset="17738292">Now, in that connection, that project is rather unique in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.638" offset="17758459">As far as I‘m aware, it's the only federal reclamation project, certainly the only one of any size which is located in two different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.450" offset="17797747">The -- the unit of the Rio Grande Federal Reclamation Project located in New Mexico is known as the Elephant Butte Irrigation District consisting about 90,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.123" offset="17840483">The unit in Texas, is El Paso of County Water Improvement District No. 1 which irrigates about 70,000 acres and the Government has a warrant in that contract with the (Inaudible) County District of about 18,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.689" offset="17894713">So, when New Mexico came in to the Union in 1912, the water rights were thoroughly fixed and established as far as the Federal Rio Grande Reclamation Project and the Texas part of it was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.704" offset="17958766">Now, at that point or a little later, the Congress of the United States passed an Act of March the 13th 1928, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to make a contract with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District looking toward the improvement and the betterment of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.875" offset="18051448">And in that Act of Congress, it was specified that the amount of present acreage of the Indian Pueblos within the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District was 8346 acres which should have prior rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.351" offset="18133368">And that in the agreement with the district, the Secretary of the Interior should provide concerning the additional Indian acreage that they should stand on the same footing and have a parity with other like lands of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.308" offset="18201182">So there, we have an Act of Congress which gave priority to a tentative 8346 acres of land and the equality to an additional, approximately 15,000, as they estimated it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.404" offset="18273593">Now, pursuant to that authority, the Secretary of the Interior made a contract of December the 14th, 1928, which is in the record whereby, it was agreed that the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District should place improvements in this area including the construction of impounding reservoirs and that the Indians should have certain rights under that and recited the Act of Congress and recited 8346 acres as having priority with the right to the Secretary to change that figure and with some -- some 15,000, as were recited there, having an equality with the other like lands of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.980" offset="18479856">Now, that contract provided that as far as the 8800-- as the 8346 acres of land were concerned, there was to be no charge for the construction of impounding reservoirs, El Vado being one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.702" offset="18554776">The El Vado being constructed from 1933 to 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.682" offset="18578704">But, that such charges as were made, were made in behalf of the newly reclaimed Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.431" offset="18617678">So, under that contract, no charge whatever was made to the 8346 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.975" offset="18655817">Now, the 8346 acres could, under no theory secure storage rights in El Vado because they didn't pay a dime for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.117" offset="18708376">And furthermore, whatever rights that any of them got under that contract of December the 14th, 1928, it had to be under the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.758" offset="18758949">In other words, there was an application made for the construction of El Vado.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.610" offset="18782354">And as I've said, it was completed between 1933 and 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.518" offset="18801998">So, the Indian rights, as well as all of the other rights came under and through the State of New Mexico which could rise and could rise no higher than the rights of State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.376" offset="18865424">Now, the State of New Mexico couldn't grant rights and couldn't take rights itself that were superior or -- to the -- the rights that had been secured by the United States in 1906 and 1908 by the federal filings for the benefit of the record of the -- the federal Rio Grande Reclamation District at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.784" offset="18947135">Then, differences having -- having arisen there came the contract of 1929 which had the temporary compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.305" offset="18981198">And in that connection, I call the Court's attention to the fact that in Article 9 of the temporary compact, there is exactly the same language with reference to the Indian rights as is in the present, permanent contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.145" offset="19048490">Now, difficulties arose over the carrying out of the temporary compact of 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.058" offset="19076180">Texas came in to this Court in 1935 alleging that New Mexico had violated the temporary compact of 1929 and asked that certain provisions of that contract be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.455" offset="19133753">It also asked for an adjudication of her rights under the ordinary irrigation laws of the United States and -- and as enforced in the western states of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.737" offset="19186939">Now, that case involved the question that we have here now as to the indispensability of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.968" offset="19231869">It was a suit by the same State of Texas against the same State of New Mexico and the same Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District in which were the same six Indian Pueblos that are there now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.503" offset="19285995">The Court overruled that motion in that case and the present compact was later executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.019" offset="19336046">Now, after that took place, New Mexico must have concluded or considered that that language in Article 9 of the temporary compact which was carried forward into Article 16 of the present compact was workable or she would never had signed the compact, because she'd already been through this question of indispensability of the United based on that same -- on that same language in the 1929 temporary compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.392" offset="19457567">Now, after that took place, there was another contract made between the Secretary of the Interior and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District involving these Indian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.449" offset="19513783">That was a contract of September 4th, 1936, where it was provided that -- that lands which had been bought by the United States for Indian use after 1928, the date of the Act of Congress specifying 8346 acres of prior right land and the rest of the parity land should be considered by the Secretary in the determination of the final acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.091" offset="19628304">And later, there was a contract of April the 8th, 1938, whereby, the -- the language in -- in it with reference to this point was the same except the sentence was added classing the lands bought by the United States as being newly-reclaimed lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.725" offset="19710851">So, when we reached determination of that contract, we find that the Secretary of the Interior, under authority of the Act of Congress, has made the determination as to what Indian acreage it is that has prior rights and to what Indian acreage it is that has rights to stand on the same basis as farther like lands of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.566" offset="19838224">On April the 8th, 1938, the Secretary pursuant to the authority given to him in the Act of February 1928, made that determination and published it in the federal register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.032" offset="19900082">At that point, that the compact was entered into between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, it being the compact of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.604" offset="19962358">Now, our position is with reference to that compact, of course, under the Doctrine of the Hinderlider case that it necessarily bound all of the water uses in New Mexico by the terms of that compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.864" offset="20043442">And the compact provides with reference to the waters of the Rio Grande that a certain percentage of water originating in Colorado should be allocated to Colorado with the rest going down into New Mexico and that New Mexico should be entitled to receive a certain percentage of the waters of the Rio Grande originating in New Mexico plus that quantity which came down from Colorado, and that the remainder, if there was any, should pass on down to the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.461" offset="20261825">Article 4 of the compact has a scale of measurement there determining the amount of water that New Mexico is under obligation to deliver to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.283" offset="20321071">And that depends on the amount of water passing the upper gaging station at Otowi as related to the lower station down at San Marcial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.991" offset="20375928">Whenever, the flow at Otowi is less than 100,000 acre feet, New Mexico is under no obligation under the compact to deliver even so much as a teacup full of water at San Marcial, the lower gaging station.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.057" offset="20448131">But if 200,000 acre feet passes the gaging station at Otowi, then according to the terms of the compact, 65,000 acre feet is to be delivered at San Marcial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.887" offset="20515527">In other words, that's 32.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.324" offset="20529215">And there is a sliding scale on that so where -- where under if the condition never existed, where I say is 900,000 acre feet were gaged at Otowi, then the State of New Mexico would be under obligation to deliver in the Elephant Butte Reservoir 742,000 acre feet or 74 and two tenths percent of the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.435" offset="20633704">Now, our position is that that obligation is just as valid and just as binding as the promissory note to pay a certain amount of money at a stated time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.645" offset="20682501">And it is not due to the -- to the draft, it is due Texas says because of conditions which the State of New Mexico has brought about herself and by the allowance of the accumulation of non-beneficial vegetation in the river by failing to keep the weeds cleaned out of the ditches, their -- their canals and drains have built up to where the water level of the area has been raised into small plants and evaporation has taken place and large quantities of water which should have been delivered to Texas have been withheld by New Mexico or dissipated or allowed to escape so that they never went into Elephant Butte Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.382" offset="20917499">And in that connection, I would like to call to the Court's attention the testimony of the engineer advisor to the Commissioner for the State of Texas to the effect that New Mexico could remedy this condition by reducing per water consumption 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.319" offset="21001195">And he stated that that could be done by the elimination of non-beneficial uses without affecting the Indian lands at all or without affecting anybody's land, if they would go in there and expend some money in cleaning out these ditches and -- and elevating their water table.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.993" offset="21087922">The same condition existed 20 years ago prior to the 1929 contract when they had a -- a graded river badge, they had a -- a graded canals and ditches, and they did go in there and they remedy their situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.727" offset="21162841">Now, the record in this case shows that they had $300,000 which was available for that purpose and $300,000 will certainly get lots of weeds and vegetation out of the irrigation canals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.215" offset="21248836">The result of the building up of these various circumstances and occasions is, as we see it, that 88,047 acres of the Indian land undoubtedly has prior rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.226" offset="21332846">Now, as to what has been done in the way of delivering water to the Indians is this, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District has allowed all of its canals and laterals to run bank-full.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.210" offset="21404839">And they've said to the Indians, “Here it is, help yourself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.333" offset="21425319">The record shows that that has been their procedure for more than -- for who else -- yes, for approximately 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.184" offset="21460637">The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District was organized in 1925, and doing all of that time since it's organization through good years and bad years, and every other kind of years, they have allowed that water to run through their canals, bank-full and they have allowed the Indians and non-Indians and everybody else to help themselves without any question of measurement of water or how much you're entitled to, take all you want, there it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.420" offset="21573590">Now, that being the -- the situation in -- yes, and in connection with that too, the record shows that in 1938, about the time and negotiations for the new compact to the permanent compact were taking place between New Mexico and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.084" offset="21656242">They pulled every gauge they had, offer their canals and the record shows that prior to that time, they did have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.039" offset="21684140">They had -- according to the testimony of their engineer, they had gauges on all of their main canals on all of their laterals and ditches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.712" offset="21726772">But there's no explanation of why that about the time this compact was signed, they pulled everyone of them off there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.710" offset="21754776">And there's no explanation of what they did with the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.437" offset="21769718">And now, they come in and say, we don't know how much to give the Indians, although, the record shows it for several years, prior to 1938, they've been measuring that water.</text>

            <text syncTime="5652.310" offset="22609189">Now, in that connection, several years ago, before this matter came up whereby the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District desired to turn this over to the United States, the matter was called to the attention of the States of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.277" offset="22693094">And Texas became very much concerned about it, being apprehensive that if any such arrangement were made that it would be detrimental to the rights of Texas under the Rio Grande Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.022" offset="22752026">And for that reason, as it's shown by the letter of governor in view for gesture in the record, Texas vigorously protested, unless, there was a qualification to this authorization whereby New Mexico -- whereby, the -- the operation of the New Mexico facilities would be limited to a compliance with the Rio Grande -- with the Rio Grande Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.222" offset="22872816">And in pursuance of that objection and protest that was made by the State of Texas, the Congress of the United States when they authorized this arrangement with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District put in the Act that it was conditioned on the operation of the project facilities of the Middle Rio Grande Project being in conformity with the Rio Grande Compact as administered by the Rio Grande Compact Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.636" offset="23018475">So, under that Act of Congress, the United States nor the Bureau of Reclamation, nor any of these officers or agents can open a gate, can turn a wheel, or can operate a valve, unless it be in conformity with the Rio Grande Compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="5968.768" offset="23874978">Now, the -- the gate tender or the Bureau of Reclamation or the Secretary of the Interior, if you want to call him, because after all he's doing, he's not going tosay to the land owner, set out and take this water because it's good for you at this time.</text>
