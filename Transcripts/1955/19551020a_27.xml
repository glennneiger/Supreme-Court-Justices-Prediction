            <label>Mr. David P. Findling</label>
            <text syncTime="9.224" offset="36885">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.191" offset="48692">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.310" offset="57156">The National Labor Relations Board has brought this case here on certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Firth Circuit, which dismissed the Board's petition to adjudge the Warren Company in contempt of an enforcement decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.569" offset="130194">The enforcement decree had been entered in the conventional enforcement proceedings in the court below under Section 10 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act, and among other things required the company to bargain collectively with Lodge 46 of the Machinists Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.184" offset="208666">The court below had recognized in the enforcement proceedings that under the applicable substantive law and the decisions of this Court, it was obliged to enter the enforcement decree requiring bargaining with the union, despite the union's inability to maintain its majority membership among the employees after the refusal to bargain and other unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.930" offset="331651">But the Court held in the contempt proceeding that the different consideration, and that's a quotation from the Court's opinion, the different considerations applicable to contempt as distinguished from enforcement proceedings committed it in its discretion to accept as a defense in the civil contempt proceedings, the lost of majority which it had recognized was not a defense to the entry of the enforcement decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.633" offset="454531">We think that in taking this position, the Court exceeded the permissible limits of its legal discretion and that in the circumstances of this case, the Court was found to give effect to the enforcement decree by compelling obedience to it through the imposition of civil contempt sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.943" offset="543765">The facts as they are set forth in the Board's petition to adjudge the company in contempt was substantially admitted in the company's answer, and may I think the -- fairly summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.013" offset="611997">After the usual unfair labor practice proceedings under Section 10 of the Act, the Board found on June 30, 1949, that the company had violated Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.822" offset="683259">Professing a doubt as to the union's majority status when in fact it had no such doubt and at the same time, making an election to determine the employees true wishes impossible by dismissing four -- by discharging four of the eight employees in the unit because they had joined the union and by engaging another acts of intimidation and coercion with respect to the employees unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.369" offset="805407">After the Board's decision order issue, the company took steps to comply with the reinstatement requirements as the payment of back pay to the employees discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.349" offset="861309">It also post the notices required by the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.921" offset="879595">But it did not comply with the bargaining requirements of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.458" offset="901747">In that respect, as the undisputed fact show the company despite repeated request by the union for bargaining conferences met with the union only once during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.461" offset="953783">That was on September 8, 1950 when the union submitted a contract proposal and the company took no position on it except to say that it would consider the proposed contract and let the union know whether the contract was acceptable and if the contract was not acceptable, it would submit counter proposals with respect to the provisions that were unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.120" offset="1060467">This promise, the company never kept thereafter despite the union's repeated request for a statement of its position on the contract or prepare the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.537" offset="1106129">Instead, on August 6, 1951, the company wrote the union that only two of the eight employees comprising the union -- the unit continued to be employed in the plant, but the company therefore doubted the continued majority status of the union and that it would be glad to meet on August 16 and here I quote from the letter which is at 41 of the record, “To discuss this feature and what proof you have of the majority status.”</text>
            <text syncTime="310.706" offset="1242802">At about the same time on August 14, the Board instituted the enforcement proceedings in the court below to which the company responded that although there were sufficient evidence in the record upon which to face the Board's findings and order, the order should nevertheless not be enforced because -- and here again I quote, and this is at pages 1 and 2 of the record, “The order has been obeyed in all of its provisions and because of changed condition, not attributable to respondent's conduct and the references obviously is to the turn over among the employees in the unit normal cost of business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="354.222" offset="1416882">The union does not now represent a majority in this small unit and respondent should not be required to bargain fairly with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.502" offset="1453976">The court below rejected that defense in the enforcement case principally on the authority of this Court's decision in National Labor Relations Board against Mexia Textile Mills in 339 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.025" offset="1516042">The Court pointed out that in that case, this Court had expressly ruled that compliance with the order did not affect the Board's right to an enforcement decree in as much as the Act contemplated that there be immediately available to the Board, and I'm reading from the Court's opinion, “An existing Court decree to serve as a basis for contempt proceedings in the event a renewal of the unfair labor practice occurs after the enforcement order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.490" offset="1637878">In its opinion on enforcement, the court below also pointed out that the same case settled the doctrine that the union's allege lost and I'm reading again, “May not be urged as a defense in an enforcement proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="424.663" offset="1698586">And so on August 7, 1952, the court below entered its decree enforcing the Board's order including as I've said, the bargaining provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.865" offset="1743412">The union thereupon immediately renewed --</text>

            <text syncTime="456.672" offset="1826586">In the Fifth Circuit, Your Honor, they're separate document.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.763" offset="1842991">The union, thereupon, immediately as I've said renewed its request for bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.293" offset="1865143">But the company persisted in its refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.215" offset="1876846">And on August 26, 1952, which was only 19 days after the decree had been entered and of the time when of course there'd been no further meetings or bargaining between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.987" offset="1935882">The company wrote a letter to the Board with a copy to the union in which it again took the position that it had already complied with the Board's order that the union no longer represented a majority of the employees since only two of the original complement in the union continued to be employed in the plant and the company further took the position that while the lost of majority was not a defense in the enforcement case, it was a defense in further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.941" offset="2075690">And again, the further proceeding is a quotation from the company's letter.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="523.453" offset="2093767">Have there been any intervening circumstances between the date of the enforcement order and the (Inaudible) citation?</text>

            <label>Mr. David P. Findling</label>
            <text syncTime="530.215" offset="2120829">There are two intervening circumstances that the company realized then but they had not yet occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.008" offset="2144026">They occurred later in November and January of 1953, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.027" offset="2156042">And if I may, I refer to those as I reach that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.677" offset="2174642">Thereafter, until January 1953, the company engaged in rather extended correspondence with both the Board's officers and the union in which it profess the willingness to meet, but at the same time, continued to withhold forth right recognition from the union by repeatedly questioning the unions majority status among the men abandoning the plant by asking new proof of the union's majority and by ignoring the union's request for wage information in another data which the union had requested -- which the union was asking for because it insisted that such information was necessary in order for it to bargain intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.978" offset="2371814">And finally, when on January 19, 1953, a meeting was finally arranged with the company and this was the only meeting after the Court decree and only the second meeting between the parties in the entire history of their relationships since the Board's order was entered in June 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.538" offset="2466064">The company flatly took the position that it hesitated to bargain with the union on the matter of a contract because of its doubts as to majority and that asked the union to consent to a Board election to redetermine its status as the employees agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.980" offset="2543909">The union refused to do so in substance taking the position that under the Board's order and the course decree, the company continued to be obliged to bargain with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.102" offset="2592392">And the Board, on March 4, 1953, sustained the union in this position in effect and dismissed a petition for a new election and this is one of the circumstances Mr. Justice Harlan, the petition for a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.867" offset="2655399">Dismissed a petition for a new election which the company had filed on January 27, 1953 and which it had supported by a letter dated November 3, 1952 and that's the second new circumstances, the receipt of this letter from November 3, 1952 which was signed by five of the six employees then in the unit and which said in effect that the employees did not want the union to represent them and asked that the union be -- be certified as their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.393" offset="2805551">So, I say that was attached to the company's petition to the Board for a new election which petition of the Board rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.240" offset="2840869">Now, despite this rejection of the company's petition, the company refused to answer still another request by the union for bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.968" offset="5535869">The Court held that the union did lost its majority status even before the enforcement decree and that while such a loss was not a defense in the enforcement case as I've said, it was a defense in the contempt proceedings because and I'd like to quote here again from the Court's opinion, “In such a proceeding, the Court determines for itself what order will best serve the public interest and at the same time vindicate its own decree and it will not in disregard of the plain language of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.302" offset="5661153">And this is at record 82 that employees are entitled to choose their own bargaining representative and may not have one not of their own choosing force upon them issue a contempt order which has the effect of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.493" offset="5717891">And Your Honors, I believe that Mr. Justice Frankfurter's questions to me and my answers to him have indicated our disagreement with the Court's view that to require the company to bargain in the circumstances of this case would be repugnant to the Act because it would be to impose a representative on the employees not chosen by the mandate of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.617" offset="5830426">And so I want to address myself in the few minutes I have to the second position that the Court of Appeals took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.616" offset="5862400">That is that in the -- in the contempt case, it had a -- an unlimited discretion to determine for itself whether or not the loss of majority should be accepted as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.355" offset="5933349">Of course, we think the Court was wrong in that and the principle case on the point is of course the Union Tool against Wilson in 259 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.924" offset="5983608">In that case, this Court pointed out that even in civil contempt proceedings; the power of a Court is not the discretion of the Court, is not so unlimited that it can refuse to apply well settled principles of law to -- a conceded state of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.429" offset="6061662">And this -- this Court later pointed out in the Penfield cases -- in the Penfield case and Jacksonville Paper as cited in our brief that the grant or withholding of remedial relief in civil contempt is not wholly discretionary with the judge but must be measured by the private or public rights that the law under decree seek to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.575" offset="6150269">Now here, the statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its enforcement powers in the first place was designed to prevent in remedy unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.747" offset="6194887">And the machinery which Congress has set up to achieve that purpose contemplated coordinated action of dual responsibility on the part of the Court as well as the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.986" offset="6243892">The Court's responsibility under the statute was to apply its injunctive and contempt powers, the only sanctions that the statute imposes to compel obedience to proper Board orders which have been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.415" offset="6301571">But the -- the Court's discretion therefore we say was governed by those standards and by this legislative purpose and policy and by this responsibility which Congress had imposed other the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.036" offset="8308088">This request made to the National Labor Relations Board for an election to determine by secret ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.091" offset="8344346">The majority status was flatly denied by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.509" offset="8365976">Now these were the facts as found by the Court, the judge of the facts in a contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.981" offset="8399830">And the Fifth Circuit said, "It would not hold the respondent in contempt where it appear that the Board, by refusing to lend its assistance to a decertification election is responsible for the situation as now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.207" offset="8492826">In the opinion of the Court, a contempt adjudication would result in a violation of the Act and of the public policy for which it stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.275" offset="8549042">Now, the Legislative History of Act of 1947 which certainly confirmed the belief that the Act and the amendments were passed not for the protection of the employer, not for the protection of the union but for the benefit of the employee and him alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.061" offset="8668160">His right to participate in union activities or to refrain from such participation was to be safeguarded at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.328" offset="8717270">And even before the 1947 Act, the Courts frequently decreed enforcement condition upon an election to be held by the Board to determine the majority staffs in view of change conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.203" offset="8796787">As early as in 1938 with the Second Circuit in the Remington (Inaudible) case said that in granting enforcement -- in granting enforcement that it conditions change or had changed, the employer should challenge the power of the union and must invoke an inquiry of the Board if it did not bargain with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.623" offset="8906397">And the Court speaking through Judge Learned Hand said, "If it does so, that is invoke the inquiry, we shall treat that to refusal that is to bargain as a contempt until after the Labor Board has certified the results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.397" offset="8981525">And other courts granted similar relief where there was a good -- there was good course to believe that the union no longer represented the majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.722" offset="9606792">After the order of the Court, they only met one time and I would not say that that was serious bargaining, if Your Honor pleases, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.320" offset="9649215">It was confronted at all the times with the doubt as a majority status.And in the interval was this petition presented to the man written form by the employees stating that they didn't want any union representing them for bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.503" offset="9729985">Now, under the old proceedings and before the Act of 1947, the Board would not yield in its decisions and repeatedly refused to grant elections in such instances of changed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.448" offset="9789753">But the Congress took note of the situation under the practice and enlarged the right of petition in representation cases in the reply of the Board to hold election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.306" offset="9841162">Speaking of the past practices of the Board, the Senate Labor Committee said, "Despite the absence of discriminatory language in the Act, the Board refused to entertain petitions filed by employees who wished to demonstrate that the current or a certain bargaining representative is not the choice of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.257" offset="9948996">The Committee bill would make it necessary for the Board to entertain petitions from the employees irrespective of the kind of the reliefs sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.851" offset="9999360">So to correct the abuses, Congress abducted the provisions of Section 9 (c) in the 1947 Act, enlarging the right of petition on the part of the employee and employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.344" offset="10061322">And it was a conference committee that reported significant changes in operations may require a redetermination of the bargaining representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.714" offset="10110851">Similarly, a substantial expansion or diminution of the working force might require special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.274" offset="10149094">The Conference Committee, the Senate Labor Committee, the House Labor Committee clearly expressed the mandate that an election must be held upon a petition except when and only one instance where an election had been held in the previous 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.229" offset="10232895">And no election has ever been held in this employer's plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.299" offset="10257136">Congress fully guaranteed that no union would be thrust on the employees by adding in the 1947 Act to Section 7 that employees might refrain from participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.452" offset="10321711">Employee shall have the right to refrain from any and all of such activities.Congress was positive in its purpose to protect the employee and give expression to his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.226" offset="10376882">Now, the facts presented relied upon by the Board or the -- in cases relied upon the -- by the Board are clearly distinguishable from the facts in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.498" offset="10449920">In the Brooks case which Mr. Findling has mentioned, there has been an election in which the union won eight to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.310" offset="10485238">One week later, there was a change in heart on the part of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.333" offset="10505300">There had been an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.113" offset="10512405">There was no election in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.317" offset="10525257">In the Brooks case, there was no petition for decertification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.540" offset="10546155">In this case, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.533" offset="10558067">In the Brooks case, this Court pointed out the employees or employer should submit the grievance to the Board and petition for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.953" offset="10611775">This we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.451" offset="10621701">And in the great (Inaudible) case which it cites that is under an old statute and did not contain the provisions of Section 7 and 9 (c) (1) and therefore we contend it's inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.752" offset="10682932">And we say that it may be assumed that this practice of the old Board under the old Act was under review by the Congress in the writing of the 1947 Act and was the practice at which it was striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.457" offset="10757747">Now, we contend that our course of conduct had been repeatedly approved in the Fifth Circuit and in other courts as we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.049" offset="10812186">The lower Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the contempt petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.301" offset="10837159">It said, "Under these circumstances, we think that the Court, instead of vindicating would (Inaudible) itself and its own decree and do violence to the Act if it ordered the employer to force upon its employees as bargaining agent, a union, not (Inaudible) merely because some six years before, the Board had ordered the employer to recognize it as bargaining agent for its then employees.</text>
