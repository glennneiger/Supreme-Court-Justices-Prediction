            <label>Mr. Charles A. Ellis</label>
            <text syncTime="18.703" offset="74710">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.457" offset="85786">This is a case which involves primarily I think and respondent's counsel insist that it involves primarily a question of a seaman's release.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.920" offset="143673">It involves incidentally though along with that also some very important questions of liability and of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.122" offset="184424">The background of the case is that its not a startlingly pornographic.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.877" offset="219429">The petitioner was a seaman on a coastal oil tanker, a Negro described by the District Court as an upstanding type of individual who neither smoked nor drank.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.610" offset="286407">There was (Inaudible) or so, a Puerto Rican -- I mean a Cuban Negro who was a messman and who was called by some of the crew a queer, by others a fruit and other denominations like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.660" offset="354638">And he was described as being exceedingly feminine and having one of the principles in the particular pornographic incident, as a girl friend and they gave him jewelry and used perfume and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.552" offset="430184">Well, the -- on the evening of the 12th of January, 1950 the petitioner was looking for someone to play cards with as was frequently the case on the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.040" offset="496118">And he came to a room down on the boat occupied by three men and in there, in addition to the three men was this man Medina.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.981" offset="551915">And as he open -- as petitioner opened the door he found according to his testimony the Medina engaged simultaneously in homosexuality with two men and he was startled by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.926" offset="627670">He went and reported it to the Chief Steward who was his superior and the superior of Medina and to the union delegate on the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.261" offset="668944">That was reported then to the captain the next morning according to the Chief Steward by the Chief Steward, some of the evidence indicates it was reported that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.380" offset="709486">But anyway the Chief Steward testifies that when it was reported where the Captain said that Medina had already reported it and that he would take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.396" offset="745535">That -- then one of the witnesses I think it's the union delegate Kaplan he testified that -- Medina said during the course of the forenoon there he was going to kill the petitioner, Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.452" offset="817737">Well, anyway that evening there was a meeting held in one of the rooms aboard ship to discuss apparently primarily a question of whether this incident would be reported to the coastguard and the coastguard requested to remove this man from the ship as an unfit member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.719" offset="906867">That was attended by among others the petitioner and the three men allegedly involved in the pornographic incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.594" offset="946364">And the two men that were engaged with Medina in this act, one named Pittaway and other named (Inaudible), they didn't back up the petitioner's story at the hearing now on the boat, of course they were involved too, but they offered to quit the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.512" offset="1046047">The -- but by reason of it being petitioner's story only of what happened, why, the meeting wound up indeterminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.246" offset="1092963">And before the end of the meeting some apparently about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of that meeting Medina left the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.472" offset="1141864">It develops later then that what he did was he went and got according to the one part of the testimony, he stole the key according to some other testimony he got from the Steward the key to the galley and got a meat cleaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.140" offset="1204558">As a matter of fact the meat cleaver that Thompson, the petitioner himself was trying to use in chopping meat, very heavy meat cleaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.074" offset="1244264">And then as the rest of the men were coming out along side one of the passage ways on the boat Medina was there, described as being up against the wall, one of the men that passed before Thompson described it that way and then as Thompson came by he yelled out in a loud screech of voice, â€œI am going to kill you, you so and so," and clubbed him three times with all his might on the head with the meat cleaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.530" offset="1354083">The testimony indicates that if as a manner of fact the petitioner hadn't had an extraordinarily abnormally think skull he would have been killed instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.592" offset="1406328">As it happened the blade cut through the two parts of the skull but didn't actually penetrate apparently the brain.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.111" offset="1456379">It did though according to encephalograms and reports from two hospitals where encephalograms were taken produce encephalopathy due to trauma which is -- which means a disease of the brain.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.057" offset="1528163">It's far greater than concussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.288" offset="1545091">He was in the hospital for about something over 5 months, that is in the -- in hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.580" offset="1574243">He was in several hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.437" offset="1581662">He -- he was taken off the boat and put in one there in a Texas port where they landed and then sent to Houston, then sent to New Orleans and then sent to Stapleton and while he was at New Orleans he had to go back to Texas to attend the criminal trial of Medina.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.411" offset="1665567">But on the train he was so disabled, he got sick and had to be taken off, taken to the hospital and treated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.288" offset="1705064">And the trial postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.605" offset="1710393">Medina by the way was tried and convicted and sent to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.867" offset="1735367">Then after he had been in the hospital 5 or 6 months and he was discharged into a condition of out-patient then and he got $300 from the defendants to take a trip down to Arkansas where he originally came from apparently to take some salt baths, thought he would feel better and they had passed him the money and he went down there and then came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.053" offset="1860127">And when he came back he went to see Mr. Mahoney the man who had advanced him the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.302" offset="1881130">Incidentally he had correspondence with Mahoney.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.387" offset="1893460">Mahoney had told him even while he -- before he arrived in New York I will be glad to see you and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.679" offset="1926687">I mention that because respondent's counsel makes much of the fact that the man approached them to settle his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.973" offset="1971827">And that he acted on his own, he insisted on acting on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.572" offset="1990217">The picture is one though of pitiful reliance as shown by the way by their own -- by the correspondence the letters that respondent themselves introduced in evidence pitiful reliance on Sealing &amp; Jarvis, the agents for the defendant shipowner and on Mahoney.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.042" offset="2072137">So when he got back he went to see Mahoney for discussion of settlement possible getting some money out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.837" offset="2111321">And Mahoney had some discussion with him and then sent him to a man named Barron who was the agent for the insurance underwriter.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.219" offset="2156774">And Mahoney told him according to petitioner's testimony that he didn't think they could pay more after -- by the way speaking to Barron, that they didn't think -- he didn't think they could pay him more than the $4000 because you're well.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.124" offset="2240470">The -- he was sent however to Barron to have a discussion with him and he had to -- he had as a matter of fact -- this transpired before he went to Arkansas, this -- what I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.480" offset="2297835">He had two conferences with Barron, was sent to Barron, Barron testifies that when he approached him he first asked for a $15,000 in settlement, but he thought he managed to talk him down to $6000 at that first conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.852" offset="2371396">And then when he got back from Arkansas he paints it as a story where the petitioner was asking for $6000 and he told him then that he has already saved money if he took $4000 instead of hiring an attorney because most attorney's charge one-third of recovery and now the pitiful reliance on the one hand of his man and the abject submission off into overreaching is illustrated if by well, all through the negotiations, but also by that particular aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.732" offset="2534922">Imagine a man being told that on the one hand he do better off, they're talking about a figure of $6000 now and that he'd do better off not to hire attorneys that would save attorney's fees and then whack it there because they are about a third and then whack the $6000 by the third, retain the $2000 even on that item for the defendants and gave him the $4000.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.307" offset="2645159">He managed to convince this man that that was better for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.483" offset="2665848">They also told him -- Barron told him quite specifically that in regard to the legal matter he had a very weak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.872" offset="2707435">The representation there was that his right of recovery depended on proving that the shipowner company had notice of the dangerous character of Medina, when they shipped him on board.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.946" offset="2775771">In other words the old common law rule of anyone's liability for his own negligence which was long before the Jones Act, long before any of the other modern employee's liability legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.847" offset="2835331">In fact you can find a case to that effect way back in I think about volume one or two reprint, that if a man is negligent in hiring somebody that is absolutely a danger to other people he was liable even then.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.451" offset="2901786">But they were talking as of a time when the Jones Act was in existence for one thing and that confers a cause of action for negligence and this Court has held in two cases where it's true the one who committed the assault was somewhat a superior, one was a foremen, the stevedore and the other was boatswain on a boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.443" offset="3005753">They held that where the assault was committed by them that commission of that assault was negligence under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.231" offset="3056849">The Court has never had before it denied certiorari in a case that would have presented it perhaps in the Jones case, Jones against Lykes Brothers some time ago has never had before it the application that two men of equal disposition, equal status on the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.481" offset="3137829">But the rationality of the Jones decision seems to be -- Judge Learned Hand's views in fact comparing it with some of the others seems to be that a mere fight doesn't show such a malicious disposition of a man on board as to create on the one hand unseaworthiness or to constitute negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.288" offset="3261127">Whereas the use of a meat cleaver or something like that such as was involved in the Boudoin case before Your Honor's last term, by the way there the man if I recall correctly was hit one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.242" offset="3316924">But that was -- no, that wasn't a meat cleaver case that was a case of the brandy bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.172" offset="3336673">But it cited the Keen case that Judge Learned Hand had decided in the Second Circuit that did involve a meat cleaver assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.466" offset="3369796">And there the meat cleaver was used for one blow, here the man was struck three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.433" offset="3397695">In both those cases, both the Keen case and the Boudoin case by the way the assaulting man was drunk at the time and yet the ground of holding unseaworthiness in the case was that the man was not fit to be a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.471" offset="3473868">He was -- the very happening of the assault showed conclusively that the ship was unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.671" offset="3502602">Now in this case the man was perfectly sober, Medina.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.155" offset="3516604">He was simply this kind of character that weird sort of creature that shouldn't have been on the boat in the first place and whose act in assaulting this man with a meat cleaver certainly show that it's -- if there is a Jones Act liability there is unseaworthiness liability along the line of the Boudoin case and the Keen case.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.594" offset="3678354">Yes, what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.893" offset="3683474">Barron -- Barron represented that to him, one of his representations was that in order to recover he would have to prove that the defendant had notice of the viciousness of this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.348" offset="3749303">Now that point as a matter of fact was involved in Boudoin, that thought was involved in Keen and that points -- as a matter of fact so far as unseaworthy, where the law is concerned is always been held, go back as to the (Inaudible) for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.141" offset="3808549">There, it was a case where there was one boat in the forepeak part of a ship which proves to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.149" offset="3844493">It couldn't possibly have been discovered by any investigation whatever, but the boat was built so as to let water in to settle the boat off, settle the ship off and that water was let in and due to the fact that there had been defective head on one little boat there and water seeped in and destroyed some cargo, some rather valuable tropical type cargo, the boat was unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.144" offset="3968522">So the law has always been to the effect that unseaworthiness had absolutely nothing to do with negligence of the owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.976" offset="4235807">This isn't -- now bear in mind Your Honor, this isn't a fraud case necessarily, in fact perhaps I haven't -- I think I have missed pointing out one very important aspect of this case, there are two lines of decisions in this Court, one is concerning releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.008" offset="4311980">One is represented by Garret against Moore-McCormack case which is the seamen's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.317" offset="4333192">The other is represented by Callen against Pennsylvania Railroad Co. and a number of cases that have followed it which are federal employees liability cases and, and relate also to other types of individuals other than seamen or other than beneficiaries of a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.113" offset="4408424">Now, seamen -- it's been held in Garrett against Moore-McCormack that the burden of proof to sustain a seaman's release is on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.748" offset="4446981">The defendant must prove that the release was obtained fairly that the man had full understanding of his rights and that he was not overreached in anyway and fair consideration pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.797" offset="4511138">Now under Callen, under the Callen case the court divided there on that very point on the rest of the case though, they -- there seemed to have been no division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.853" offset="4555337">There were four justices who thought that perhaps the same rule that applied to seamen should be applied out of liberality to these other railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.598" offset="4598387">But the -- the majority held that no, they were different and that the burden of proof was on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.232" offset="4628898">Now, we -- we have a case here where we start out with the burden of proof on the defendant to prove that this man had full understanding of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.829" offset="4683233">Now how could he possibly have full understanding of his rights since his rights are rights which arise out of unseaworthiness and out of negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.595" offset="4726282">We think also there's a case for Jones Act negligence here due to the fact that there was such a breach of duty here on the part of this assault that that constituted negligence within the Jones Act concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.793" offset="4787096">But how could that possibility be a full understanding of his legal rights on the one hand when he is told that his rights of getting anything passed $200 maintenance and cure depend on proving notice to the owner that this man is a vicious character and when he is told as regards his disability that he is well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.094" offset="4888346">As a matter of fact the man is disabled now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.738" offset="4898900">His head was bandaged on the very day of the trial four years later when he'd been over at the hospital and shortly before that had to and had to have a drainage taken from his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.977" offset="4963892">So the man -- I don't think there is any question about the fact that the man was completely overreached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.935" offset="4987716">But I don't think that's necessarily the point because the -- we meet right off the point that he wasn't given a full explanation of his rights and he wasn't given fair treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.225" offset="5044872">Now, incidentally on that -- my time is getting short, there is one feature I want to call the Honors' attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.494" offset="5069949">If you look at the fact of the record, I think as a matter of fact, back of the major part of the record there at page 347A, those are the text of the release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.437" offset="5109656">I think this release as a matter of fact is void on its face because it recites here --</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.245" offset="5144973">347A of this -- it's the Circuit Court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.702" offset="5170782">Your Honors granted an order allowing this appeal without turning up the record here, its right at the back Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.139" offset="5200457">About -- yes, it's the last thing in this -- in the record, that last thing that is in defendant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.826" offset="5227207">Now you'll notice it starts out, it's headed up the top release of all rights and recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.607" offset="5250403">By the way a lot of this is red print, some of it is black print and all caps and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.910" offset="5275585">And then it says by signing this release you give up every rights you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.104" offset="5292408">And William Thompson, age 56 so forth in an exchange for the sum of $4000 less the sum of $550 which has been previously paid to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.933" offset="5327726">Now by the way let me interrupt there just one moment there is no word of evidence in the record to support that he got $550, the utmost I can find is $450, that -- including $100 -- the $300 that was advanced to him to go to Arkansas, $100 advanced to him to make the trip to attend the trial of Medina, and $50 that was advanced to him at his specific request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.891" offset="5439530">Then this goes on, it says, which I received do hereby release and forever discharge Coastal Company and the several vessels in particular Rosina Marron, the owners and so forth from our own account of injuries or illnesses suffered by me as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.052" offset="5504104">The injuries, illness alleged to have been sustained by me and/or illnesses alleged to have been incurred and contracted by me while I was in the service of the said steamship Rosina Marron on or about January 30, 1950 and or at any time or times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.049" offset="5572127">And in addition to that I release them from each and every right or claim which I now have or may here have to have because of any matter or thing which happened before signing this paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.203" offset="5620715">It being my intention -- notice the last line there, even as respects, injuries, illnesses rights and claims not mentioned herein or not known to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.684" offset="5662720">Now, how can a release covering rights not known to the seamen on his face stating to be rights not known to the seamen be nevertheless a release of rights which the seaman fully understands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.011" offset="5716010">And if -- if there is a release here of rights not known to the seaman how can any part of that $4000 consideration be attributed anymore to the release of rights that were known if there were any, actually known and then to the rights that aren't known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.128" offset="5784451">Then it goes on down before and below, read the following six numbered statements carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.004" offset="5807961">I know this paper is much more than we see it as release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.727" offset="5818828">I am giving up every right I have, now why have a right if the man is supposed to have a full understanding of his rights and it's supposed to deal with his tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.779" offset="5859056">Then it goes on in making up my mind to this release, I am using my own judgment without regard to anything that has been told to me by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.627" offset="5898449">He's entitled to rely on the representations made to him by these parties that seek the release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.973" offset="5927811">That I know that in signing this release I am among other things now settling in for -- for all injuries, illnesses and disabilities I have had already, which I have now or which I may have in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.780" offset="5975040">Either because of -- either because of the particular occurrence mentioned above or because of any other occurrence in the past or because of both, even though I do not know that I have had already, have not or may have, have now or I may in the future such injuries, illnesses or disabilities and even though they are mentioned particularly in this release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.720" offset="6062811">And I do all this regardless of what anyone may have told me about my injuries, illnesses or disabilities or about anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.328" offset="6093218">Then it goes on regardless of what anyone may have told me I release also -- I realize also that my injuries may be worse than they seem to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.656" offset="6134596">Down below or rather a neat feature you'll notice (a), answer to either where they asked him what -- what are you doing and they tell him what to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.588" offset="6174302">We submit to Your Honor that the release is invalid that there was liability in the Circuit Courts should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.666" offset="6246609">I think Your Honors might know that in the eastern and southern districts particularly in around New York City the greater part of the litigation that was on there, seamen claims but probably 10 times or perhaps a dozen times that many are claims that are settled directly between seamen and shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.687" offset="6326648">And these shipowners are well versed in this Court's ruling in Garrett against Moore-McCormack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.165" offset="6352562">They know that the seaman has to be fairly treated so that the -- that the settlement will stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.689" offset="6386730">And I think that if the release as we present the facts in my brief here, for the thorough reading of the record set aside, there's going to be no alternative to shipowners but to cancel their entire adjusting departments some -- and ask a court approval on a every settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.977" offset="6475860">I mean these are the facts that as they stack up, the seaman went to four marine hospitals on the State's public healthcare hospitals following the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.197" offset="6520686">Galveston, Corpus Christi, New Orleans and finally the hospital at Stapleton, Staten Island and he was discharged there on April 28th, 1950.</text>
