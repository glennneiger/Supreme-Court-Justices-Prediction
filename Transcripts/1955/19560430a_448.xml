            <text syncTime="36.213" offset="144823">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.851" offset="167393">We have in this case a question whether certain prize fixing agreements, more specifically, certain agreements providing for resale prize maintenance are exempted from the normal operation of the antitrust laws and that question is a narrow statutory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.483" offset="273868">It turns on the language of the Miller-Tydings Act and of the subsequent McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.900" offset="307513">Stated in what have become popular terms, the question is whether the particular agreements which the Government sought to enjoin here for within the so-called "fair trade" exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.241" offset="388911">Let me invite to the Court's attention early, the specific words with which we are here concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.670" offset="430602">And I might say preliminary that for all practical purposes, the words are the same in the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 and in the McGuire Act of 1952.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="121.834" stopTime="125.966">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="121.834" offset="487236">Is this case came up on summary judgment or after the trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="125.966" stopTime="300.239">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="125.966" offset="503850">It came up after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.397" offset="509492">Actually, it was a very limited trial in which the parties relied primarily on documents and on certain depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.747" offset="550975">The Government had previously moved for summary judgment on the theory that on the admitted facts or undisputed facts this could be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.980" offset="603847">That motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.925" offset="611683">Subsequently, it went to trial at which time the Government stood basically on its position that the District Judge had urged in denying the motion for summary judgement though it did as I point out later, suggest that it had something further provide on.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.865" offset="691409">Now, Your Honors, of course, recall the federal fare trade legislation, to use that term, permits, broadly speaking, resale price maintenance in respect of branded or trademark goods which have competition from other goods of the same general character that permission from federal law being conditioned upon the particular agreement being legal under relevant state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.726" offset="822857">But this authorization, this immunity from the effect of the Sherman Act is explicitly limited by a rather pointed proviso which is the center of controversy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.492" offset="893910">And that proviso paragraph is setout among other places in the Government's opening brief at page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.760" offset="934975">It begins by stating in substance that nothing in the exemption statute shall make lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.418" offset="965590">And then, I will quote the exact words which we have italicized there on printed page.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.943" offset="999758">"Nothing contained in the paragraph shall make lawful agreements."</text>
            <text syncTime="254.385" offset="1017522">Now, I'm quoting, "Between manufactures or between producers or between wholesalers,"</text>
            <text syncTime="260.913" offset="1043644">and that phrase particular important in this case and then going on, "Or between brokers or between factors or between retailers or -- and again we emphasize specially, between persons, firms or corporations in competition with each other."</text>
            <text syncTime="280.124" offset="1120444">Now, that language, as the Court will note by granting further down the page is identical for all practical purposes with the language of the proviso in Miller-Tydings.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.183" offset="1184705">Now, with that proviso in mind, let me --</text>

            <text syncTime="314.763" offset="1258998">But in this respect, there was no change.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="318.357" offset="1273417">This proviso is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.949" offset="1283762">As Your Honor will see on page 39, we go on and quote from Miller-Tydings and Your Honor will find the same proviso, "Noting shall make lawful agreements between wholesalers or between persons, firms or corporations in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.677" offset="1354606">This was not something which Congress chose to change when it passed the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.971" offset="1379788">And if I may anticipate, the little in argument I will make later, that's, perhaps, the particular significance because this suit was brought and publically announced before the McGuire Act was passed and Congress was told about a tendency by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust when he testified in relation with the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.551" offset="1466201">But that -- that is running ahead of my story, I would like to pause.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.549" offset="1490129">Now that we have the proviso in mind and before the Court to indicate just what McKesson's operations are and what particular contracts are involved in this suit under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.636" offset="1546449">We've request the distribution to the Court of a -- of a diagram, that I see Your Honors have.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.346" offset="1569332">This is something we prepared, it's not in the nature of anything of record, and it's purely to illustrate the facts as we understand them and I think they're not substantially in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.115" offset="1620428">Now, McKesson is a manufacturer of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.023" offset="1640072">It is also a wholesaler of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.673" offset="1666612">It has various divisions but it's one corporation with one president, one chairman, one management.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.417" offset="1709662">The wholesale divisions and actually there are some 70 odd such divisions operate in various sections of the country, McKesson doing a virtually nationwide business.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.059" offset="1764206">The wholesale divisions handle McKesson brand products which are prepared or package by the manufacturing division and they also handle the products of other drug manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.338" offset="1829303">Indeed the volume of products of other drug manufactures handled by the wholesale division far exceeds the volume of the McKesson brand products.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.958" offset="1871830">McKesson, in other words, is in the general drug wholesaling business and is, indeed, the largest wholesaler of drugs in the United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="475.930" stopTime="478.454">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="475.930" offset="1903700">You mean the market in each products and all the rest of them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="478.454" stopTime="566.646">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="478.454" offset="1913731">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.061" offset="1916238">And as I say, their own brand products are only a small fraction of the total handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.201" offset="1940793">But we are concern in this case only with McKesson's own branded products and hence for purposes of this litigation, the other products can be put completely to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.816" offset="2003174">Now, let me indicate briefly on this diagram, the distribution channel so far as McKesson brand products are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.752" offset="2038909">Largest part of that merchandise -- those as indicated by the arrow in the center of the page going downward, the largest part of McKesson brand products go -- goes from the manufacturing division to the McKesson wholesale divisions which in turn, of course, resales to the retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.504" offset="2133995">Now, another segment, another portion of that merchandise shown by the arrow appearing on the righthand side of the diagram is distributed directly by McKesson manufacturing division to the retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.342" offset="2205362">Those sales have been made by McKesson's to selected desirable attempt, largely or exclusively, I think, the large drug chains such as Walgreens or Peoples.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="566.646" offset="2266488">Do you claim that those violate the -- the McGuire Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="572.909" stopTime="704.041">

            <text syncTime="573.434" offset="2293656">We are contending and I'll come to that, Your Honor, in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.605" offset="2310374">That McKesson's agreements with the independent wholesalers violate this proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.744" offset="2342975">That brings me to the third channel of distribution which I hadn't yet stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.250" offset="2364918">It's represented by the arrow that appears on the lefthand side of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.632" offset="2386442">That's the third channel, sales by McKesson's manufacturing division to independent wholesalers who in turn sell these McKesson brand products to the retail drug trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.607" offset="2438374">There is an arrow moving from right to left in the center of the page which shows only that the independent wholesalers buy some of the McKesson brand products from McKesson wholesale division operating in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.748" offset="2498978">So, they buy most of them from the manufacturing division which is in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.247" offset="2528967">Now, the independent wholesalers compete with McKesson in selling drugs to the retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.721" offset="2582883">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.245" offset="2588944">It was agreed by representatives of McKesson who testified on deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.014" offset="2624052">It reflected in stipulations which are of record and the court below so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.778" offset="2651011">It appears that some of the independent wholesalers have trade territories which are virtually identical with trade territories served by individual wholesale divisions of McKesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.155" offset="2700539">As to others, it appears that there's substantial overlapping and even as to those independent wholesalers who do not compete with McKesson wholesale division in selling to the retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.510" offset="2754038">There is still competition with McKesson because those independent wholesalers do compete with McKesson's manufacturing division in seeking the patronage of these large retail drug chains.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.610" offset="4042397">We've shown also on the chart the discounts which are permitted or given, as the case maybe, under the arrangements which McKesson had when this suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.763" offset="4099030">As Your Honors will notice the independent wholesalers could buy from McKesson's manufacturing division at 25% off the list, and list as here use means McKesson's wholesale list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.463" offset="4161829">Then when they sold in turn to the drug retailers, they were required to charge a minimum price which was no less than 14.5% off list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.904" offset="4219611">Now, if you'll compare, you will see on the right side of the diagram that McKesson's manufacturing division, when it sold to these selected large chains gave on quantity purchases up to 20% off list as contrasted with the 14.5% which the independents could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.446" offset="4301740">That was the maximum, the independent to give in those circumstances could they give anymore no matter how big the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.959" offset="4339775">I should add in fairness to appellee here that on the eve of trial in March 1955, some three years after the complaint in this case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.010" offset="4399961">McKesson did abandon this last mentioned practice and said that henceforth, the independent wholesalers could give equivalent discounts on equivalent quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.844" offset="4459311">But apart from that question as to whether McKesson was undercutting the prices which it established for its competitors, we say that we have here a pure legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.592" offset="4514273">We say that we thank these words say without any qualification and as pointedly as they can, that nothing in federal fair trade legislation shall make lawful resale price maintenance agreements between wholesalers or between persons, firms or corporations in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.852" offset="4623360">And McKesson's a wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.366" offset="4629420">It's the largest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.536" offset="4638093">The independent wholesalers are also, by definition, wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.001" offset="4655961">And apart from that, there's no dispute that the independents do compete with McKesson with both of its manufacturing and its wholesale divisions in selling McKesson brand products to the retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.272" offset="4725029">Now, it was on that basis, deeming it clear, that these agreements were not within the exemption of the McGuire Act, that the Government moved for summary judgment in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.917" offset="4787618">That was in the Southern District and that motion was denied by Judge Murphy who wrote in extended opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.878" offset="4823458">I think the gist of that opinion maybe conveyed by this single sentence which I will quote from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.170" offset="4856581">It appears in the record of 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.240" offset="4872882">Judge Murphy said, "This Court is unwilling at this stage of case law development of legislatively sanctioned resale price fixing to hold illegal per se fair trade agreements because the producer is also a wholesaler in the absence of a showing of some injury inchoate or consummate to competition."</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.744" offset="4978939">Many said further on the following page that he would not apply the doctrine that price fixing is per se illegal absent a factual showing of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.760" offset="5042991">Then on that basis, he said that the case should go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.796" offset="5063158">He also stated that if it appeared, for example, that McKesson's agreements with the independent wholesalers were -- and again I'm quoting from the opinion, this time from record 23, "If It appeared that the agreements were a first step toward and with the intent to gauge consumers, that might suffice prima facie as violation of the Sherman Act outside the privilege of the fair trade statutes."</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.849" offset="6019344">It also made the argument that if some peculiar injury to competition had to be shown beyond that which is presumed to result from price fixing generally, there was a showing of such additional injury or restraint in as much as it appeared that McKesson had undercut in dealing with the large drug chains, the prices which it had bound the independent wholesalers to charge in dealing with the same trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.935" offset="6155703">Now, Judge Clancy rejected the Government's legal theory, expressed his agreement with Judge Murphy stating incidentally that he thought that Judge Murphy had established the law of the case and then he found insufficient to show, as he put it additional restraint, this factor of undercutting which I have just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.393" offset="6273567">Now, as I indicated a moment ago, I think, McKesson's position in this Court is somewhat different from Judge Murphy's reasoning in denying summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.553" offset="6318184">As I understand its brief, it doesn't argue that the per se rule is now inapplicable to resale price maintenance as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.012" offset="6359980">What it does argue is that it is within the statutory exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.430" offset="6389656">It says that the words or rather the prohibition on agreements between wholesalers is not to be applied when the wholesaler is also a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.797" offset="6459141">It says in other words, “We sell to the independent wholesalers in our manufacturing capacity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.617" offset="6490384">Therefore, the Court should not consider our fair trade contracts with the independent wholesalers as constituting agreements between wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.265" offset="6540957">It also argues, and I think this is essentially the same argument differently expressed, that the proviso should not be applied where there is a buyer-seller relationship as between the parties to the agreement, which is really tantamount to saying, we think, the proviso should not be applied to resale price maintenance as ordinarily conceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.034" offset="6652134">Now, we think, there are number of objections to this theory or suggestion that McKesson may, for purposes of application of the statute change its character or identity at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.023" offset="6716082">In the first place, Congress did not add after the phrase between wholesalers, the words which McKesson would interpolate, i.e. unless one of the parties is also a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.144" offset="6784522">Moreover, McKesson did not --</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.437" offset="6789747">But it wouldn't have to -- it wouldn't have to interpolate that, there might be another word between all the wholesalers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.694" offset="6818691">My argument would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.498" offset="6833946">Now, McKesson, moreover, did not cease to be a wholesaler merely because the fair trade contracts which he executed with independent wholesalers were signed by an officer in the manufacturing division rather than in the wholesaling division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.350" offset="6905313">The fact remains that it competes with these people and competes with them in its capacity as wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.849" offset="6979396">I should also mention, I think, that even we go along with the suggestion that you can somehow divorce the manufacturing and wholesaling operations here, the fact remains that both its manufacturing division and its wholesaling division sell to the retail trade and they both compete with the independent wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.363" offset="7077407">So, whatever possible question one might have, and we hardly think it would be a serious one as to the application of the between wholesalers phrase, we don't see how there can be any real question as to the application of the final phrase in the proviso paragraph between persons, firms or corporations in competition with each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.694" offset="7258697">McKesson also claims support for the view that Congress wouldn't have wanted to preclude the dual manufacturer, that is the manufacturer who operates also as a wholesaler, wouldn't have wanted to preclude it from using fair trade, claims support for that in legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.096" offset="7356291">Now, before turning, as I will very briefly, in a moment to the committee reports and the debates, I would like to emphasize two background facts which we think are key importance if there's any necessity at all in this case of looking the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.219" offset="7436852">The first is, that all of the states which have fair trade laws, have in those laws phrases similar to what appears in this proviso paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.338" offset="7493277">All of them state, that agreements between wholesalers, between producers, between retailers are not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.282" offset="7529117">There's some -- there are some variations in language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.031" offset="7540088">Some say between wholesalers, others between, and among, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.534" offset="7562136">But they all have comparable language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.316" offset="7577182">The Federal Act took over that language and it added the further final phrase or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.227" offset="7620859">Now, that last phrase was added, as Senator Tydings stated, was added to the Miller-Tydings bill at the suggestion of the Attorney General to remove certain objections which he had and for purposes of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.853" offset="7691389">But the point I would emphasize particularly here, is that we don't have, in this case, a situation like -- well, a situation where it can be argued as it was in the Schwegmann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.913" offset="7755651">That the Federal Act needs to be broadly interpreted in order to give play to the basic scheme of the state laws, because the fact here is, that all of the state laws have comparable language and have had since their inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.447" offset="7833704">Now, there's a second point which stands out from the standpoint of history.I've already alluded to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.106" offset="7860349">And that is that the present suit was filed in 1951 and it was publicly announced by the Attorney General at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.502" offset="7901936">It was filed, that is to say, after Miller-Tydings and before McGuire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.866" offset="7927432">And as I've also indicated the Assistant Attorney General in charge of antirust called the attention of this suit to the congressional committee in the course of his testimony which dealt with many faces of the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.561" offset="7990230">Now, the Committee didn't comment on that, didn't comment on this suit and we don't --</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.640" offset="8118544">Now, I'm not attempting to put more weight on that than it can bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.543" offset="8142158">I don't say that Congress said we approved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.292" offset="8289071">The proviso paragraph wasn't added to Miller-Tydings until the bill reached the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.152" offset="8320522">And probably, as a result of that, there was very little comment in the committee report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.330" offset="8449254">He said he found it wholly unilluminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.872" offset="8467435">He stated, and we think quite correctly on this point, that the committee reports have language, such that I've just indicated, reflecting a general disapproval of agreements between competitors, but they do not have anything concretely discussing the situation in which the dual entrepreneurs, that is the company like McKesson finds it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.939" offset="8575687">Now, McKesson doesn't find anything either to support its position in the committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.426" offset="8597629">Hasn't cited anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.995" offset="8603899">In them in, we don't think there is anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.470" offset="8617796">It relies rather on statements of two individual legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.389" offset="8641515">One statement made when Miller-Tydings was before Congress and another statement made when the McGuire Act was before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.967" offset="8683833">The first of these doesn't, in our view, support McKesson's position at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.264" offset="8709016">The second is entirely favorable to McKesson's position but it represents, we submit, nothing more than the views of one legislator, not concurred in or disagreed with for that matter by any other legislator who had no official connection with the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.562" offset="8802220">Let me turn first, however, to the first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.454" offset="8817789">We set that forth in the Government's brief in a long footnote appearing at pages 59 and 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.692" offset="8850704">The first sentence of that statement, and it's a statement by Representative McLaughlin who was a member of the House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.563" offset="8894171">The first sentence is a paraphrase of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.724" offset="8906815">And then on page 60, there is the italicized language upon which McKesson relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.227" offset="8940878">Representative McLaughlin said, "As an example, the Act would not allow two manufacturers of similar trademark articles" -- as for instance and I'll skip some of that, "to agree between themselves as to the prize at which their respective article shall be sold."</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.020" offset="9019977">Now, we have no disagreement with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.371" offset="9033456">We think it's perfectly clear that the proviso clause would forbid two manufacturers, let us say, of different branded items, the manufacture of Calox Tooth Powder and Dr. Lyons Tooth Powder from getting together in saying that each of them would follow a certain price fixing program in relation to the product of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.475" offset="9125825">But it doesn't follow from that, that the proviso has no application to agreements by two manufacturers or two wholesalers in relation to a single trademark commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.137" offset="9176503">Indeed, Representative McLaughlin said at the outset of that sentence as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.352" offset="9205342">Now, turning to the second statement upon which McKesson relies, and this one is relevant though we don't thinks authoritative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.115" offset="9248392">That set forth at pages 66 and 67 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.710" offset="9270753">It's a statement by Senator Humphrey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.293" offset="9285172">It was made on the floor of the Senate during the debates on the McGuire bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.541" offset="9310145">And he quite specifically mentioned the case of a producer who sells to consumers, retailers and wholesalers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.145" offset="9356539">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.484" offset="9369913">Not only did he mention the case but he went on to say, "Such firms may make resale price maintenance contracts," I'm now quoting him, "with both wholesalers and retailers."</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.412" offset="9429577">Well it's perfectly plain that Senator Humphrey didn't think that the between wholesalers phrase ought to be applied to a wholesaler who is also a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.344" offset="9473358">We note that he did not discuss how one reads that of the statute, the other phrase which we think important between persons, firms, and corporations in competition with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.183" offset="9536679">But in any event, we submit, that this is a statement which can hardly overcome the express language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.719" offset="9582864">Senator Humphrey was not a -- an author of Miller-Tydings or of McGuire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.152" offset="9600522">He was not a member of any committee which considered either of those bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.587" offset="9622256">There's no indication as to whether anybody else in the Senate or in the House agreed with Senator Humphrey's position that the Attorney General's suit against McKesson was unjustified and we hardly think in the circumstances that such a statement coming from an individual legislator can have great weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.629" offset="10242508">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.292" offset="10281064">It is our position here today that the present status of the fair trade controversy can fairly be said to be that Congress intends to permit or condone, if you will, price fixing and the elimination of price competition where trademark or brand competition exist under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.473" offset="10449816">The circumstances being that it says to each state, "You are at liberty to fix your public policy on this subject."</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.311" offset="10513241">And it says to each manufacturer of trend -- trademark or branded goods, "You are at liberty to fix your business policy on this subject, namely, to impose price maintenance contracts down the stream of commerce or to withhold the imposition of such price maintenance contracts."</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.283" offset="10629120">Now, regarded in that light we have the situation of McKesson and Robbins which, of course, in addition to having 74 wholesale divisions where it sells products manufactured by all the people in the drug business, manufactures and markets through a segment of its organization known as -- as McKesson Laboratories at Bridgeport, a volume of -- of its own manufactured and branded products which in the year in question here, amounted to approximately $11 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.925" offset="10843638">And those branded trademark products manufactured by McKesson is price fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.806" offset="10883135">Now, this chart, I have no serious difficulties with it, but I would like to point out that with regard to the $763,767 shown as McKesson manufacturing sales to independent wholesalers, only 283,000, approximately, of that amount or about one-third where to divisions or to wholesale dealers whose trading areas overlapped, trading areas of McKesson and Robbins wholesale divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.636" offset="11070485">The other 480,000 were sold to wholesale dealers whose trading areas did not overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.366" offset="11113430">With regard to the $200,000 of sale, showing -- shown in the middle of the chart between independent wholesalers and McKesson wholesale divisions, the testimony is that these were courtesy sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.152" offset="11176542">In other words, if wholesaler, an independent wholesaler needed a McKesson brand product in a hurry and didn't want to get it from Bridgeport, he could conveniently get it from the nearest wholesale division, he would do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.955" offset="11231817">But I think the average was $1600 a year with each of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.955" offset="11251775">So it's really a de minimis situation and a courtesy situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.634" offset="11278524">Now with regard to this column on the right where one-and-three-tenth million are sold to selected chains, that should be viewed with the reservation that no challenges made to the retail sales of McKesson since it does not operate at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.790" offset="11379148">But it also should be born in mind that the reason why we abandoned that 20% discount, three years after this case was started, is because no point was made of the fact that we were making direct sales to retailers in the complaint or at anytime prior to the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.518" offset="11502028">And when the District Court said, "I reject the per se doctrine with respect to fair trade price fixing and I ask you to produce some proof of an additional restraint other than a restraint which exist from the mere authorization to price fix."</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.271" offset="11612996">In other words, some restraint that flows from the integrated nature of the distributive process as performed by McKesson, then they seized upon this 20% discount as a differential in treatment by McKesson Laboratories to retailers from that accorded retailers by the wholesale divisions of McKesson and by independent wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.065" offset="11728248">And they said here, we point out, is the additional restraint which Judge Murphy said would have to be produced and rather than confuse where up to that point was an issue of law by this contention that we were giving a 20% discount to retailers who bought direct certain quantities from McKesson Laboratories, we abandoned the term, the discount term because it was meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.359" offset="11925420">The -- the point we make about -- about this 20% discount is that really a chain store is a hybrid operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.535" offset="11966067">They perform not only a retail function but they also perform at least part of the wholesale function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.132" offset="11996473">Now, this Court has recognized in one of these Walling cases, Phillips against Walling, that at times the -- there is a -- an overlapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.254" offset="12048927">The Court said some agency must provide a machinery to move all merchandise form the producer to the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.393" offset="12073482">Regardless of what this function is called, it is essentially the same as wholesale chain stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.705" offset="12102740">Once they assume enough importance to justify a warehouse are engaged in wholesaling as well as retailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.217" offset="12132833">That's the reason for the 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.591" offset="12142341">The average sale, believe it or not, from a wholesale -- from a wholesale drug firm to a drugstore is $45.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.732" offset="12178913">They served on almost the daily basis if not completely on a daily basis by their wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.112" offset="12204408">And this 20% discount applies only to purchasers, single orders of $1000 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.557" offset="12234188">And in the drug business, anybody who buys from a wholesale house $1000 or more is buying because it is -- is able to warehouse and its servicing a number of stores and not merely one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.150" offset="12292598">So that we think this million -- three is out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.948" offset="12315690">And I come now to -- to the situation with respect to McKesson setup and the development of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.856" offset="12367412">Actually, the McKesson Laboratories is operated completely independently of each one of its wholesale divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.771" offset="12403043">The personnel is different, top management, yes, the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.836" offset="12419344">But each one of these McKesson wholesale divisions operates as an independent wholesale house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.535" offset="12450064">The price fixing contracts are vertical contracts in the sense that they are all -- they all have their origin at the source of the product with the manufacturer and they are all in a transaction of sale between a buyer and a seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.113" offset="12528431">There is no horizontal dealing between wholesale divisions as such and wholesale -- independent wholesalers that has any relation to the fixing of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.350" offset="12581303">The price is already fixed when the product enters the stream of commerce when it leaves the door of the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.441" offset="12613695">And we say that the subsequent relationship or the subsequent circumstance that would respect to other products, McKesson maybe in competition wholesale with other independent wholesalers is irrelevant and does not relate back to taint the validity of the original transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.829" offset="13119216">This suit was started before the McGuire Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.074" offset="13148264">We believe that when the McGuire Act was passed, despite the fact that it represented a reassertion of congressional approval in the form that Congress indicated that it could be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.491" offset="13221930">The Department of Justice took the view that if a sufficiently now interpretation of the language could prevail, that then, its lawsuit might survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.825" offset="13283265">Now, in order to have the lawsuit survive, of course, it has become necessary for the Government to ask this Court to repudiate the exposition of congressional intention which was expressed by Senator Humphrey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.245" offset="13352960">And before we dismiss it as the view, what he said as the view of a single individual and not necessarily the collective view of Congress and not necessarily indicating that the President adopted it and all the other criticism that can be made, I think we must recognize that we should look at what -- what was said and the circumstances under which it was said in order to determine what weight is to be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.283" offset="13465078">Because after all, that is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.696" offset="13478766">What weight should be given to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.492" offset="13489946">Now, what Senator Humphrey said, he said on the floor of the Senate and he said it in reply to an inquiry by Senator Sparkman which appears on page 14 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.028" offset="13548042">Senator Sparkman said, "Mr. President, I should like to ask the Senator from Minnesota one or two questions in order to be absolutely clear in my own mind that in order that the record maybe absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.563" offset="13602168">I propound these questions to the Senator from Minnesota because I know of the great interest he has in this proposed legislation, the work he has done on it and his understanding of the facts and the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.744" offset="13654936">Therefore, I should like to ask his opinion on these two questions."</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.224" offset="13676878">Now, as I understand it, Senator Humphrey led the fight for this bill on the floor of the Senate.So, that it was quite a logical thing for these questions to be addressed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.884" offset="13735497">And it is in that context in -- in those circumstances that Senator Humphrey said, and I think what he said as it appears in the middle of page 16 where we've italicized it bears repetitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.321" offset="13793280">While in one sense firms in this position function not only as producers but also as wholesalers and retailers, they may still lawfully make contracts with other wholesalers and retailers when in making such contracts they act as producers of a trademark or branded commodity rather than as wholesalers and retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.437" offset="13889724">And that we submit is the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.147" offset="13904562">And if this Court has in mind that immediately or very shortly following that colloquy, a vote was taken on the bill and the vote was 64 in favor and 16 Senators against, I think, and we have further in mind, that not a single Senator took issue with the views expressed by Senator Humphrey as to what the bill was intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.585" offset="14030263">I think it's reasonably fair to say that what Senator Humphrey said represented the intention of the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3686.095" offset="14744346">And therefore, I would say I couldn't possibly give the same answer and I think the crux of the situation lies in the difference between the situation you point out and the one that confronts us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.616" offset="14794397">Now, I don't see how we can attribute to Congress an intention to discriminate against the so-called "integrated manufacturer" who occupies another level by -- in a stream of distribution as well as the manufacturing end, when no greater economic consequence flows from the existence of such integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.609" offset="14886348">And we have a situation in the Doubleday, Doran case which was before the Federal Trade Commission which presented another aspect of this problem, and I think helps to put it in proper focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.727" offset="14946847">And there, it was not a question of manufacturer and wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.530" offset="14966073">The integration there was between a publisher of books, the source of the product and a retail store maintained by the publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.818" offset="15023229">And it was said -- it was contended that since the publisher was in competition at the retail level with other retailers that therefore, there was a violation of the McGuire Act proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.465" offset="15089789">And in passing on that, the Federal Trade Commission, which we recognized as having some expert capacity in this field, unanimously rejected such a -- a proposed interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.901" offset="15159589">And they said, "We can take judicial notice."</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.020" offset="15172023">This is at page 21 and 22 of our brief, "We can take judicial notice of the fact that many manufacturers are partially integrated and engaged to a lesser or greater degree in some form of wholesaling or retailing activity."</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.329" offset="15225313">And the fact is that integration is a widespread practice in almost every line of business and it is free throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.843" offset="15267318">It goes on to say, in determining congressional intent, there's a strong presumption that Congress does not act in a vacuum and knows what's going on contemporaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.659" offset="15314547">And he points out that no -- no economic basis for the interpretation contended for by the Government is -- is obvious from the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.326" offset="15365224">Points out that it would require vast changes in the manufacturing and distribution practices of firms throughout the country if such a construction would be place upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.348" offset="15413290">And concludes that there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to discriminate against partially integrated concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.010" offset="15451951">Now, I think that since we have to recognize a condonation on the part of Congress of the elimination of price competition, and certainly, the likelihood of the effect of price fixing at the source being -- having an impact at the subsequent levels of distribution was pointed out quite clearly in the Schwegmann case by Mr. Justice Douglas when he urged that -- that the limitation that retailers be at least given the privilege of voluntary -- voluntary agreement or acquiescence in the price fix before they were bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.945" offset="15723729">That it seems to me indicate the fact that Congress, after the caveat contained in the Schwegmann case, saw fit to reassert its approval of price fixing, both with respect to signers of agreements and non-signers is an indication that militates against the argument that Congress intended to discriminate against the partially integrated producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.642" offset="15846504">Now, against these arguments, we are confronted by the Government with the invocation of the per se doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.447" offset="15905750">As I understand the Government's argument, they say yes but price fixing is traditionally invalid, illegal per se and therefore you have the burden of showing facts which take you out of the condemnation contained in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.087" offset="16024346">Now, I -- I proceed to make this argument with some trepidation but I make it -- I confess with conviction also.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.924" offset="16079621">I think the per se doctrine is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.191" offset="16096758">That is the traditional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.834" offset="16111282">As I understand the concept, that price fixing is inherently bad to use the language in the Government brief or to use other languages by the Government that is conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.920" offset="16187664">When you say that price fixing is illegal per se, you're using an absolute like purity or perfection when soap as 99% and 44% percent pure, it's not pure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.199" offset="16264777">Similarly, if price fixing is inherently illegal, you can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.354" offset="16301349">You don't' as the Government suggests embark on an inquiry to determine -- I forgot the language -- says, "In determining the legality of any given price fixing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.557" offset="16362162">Well, you don't inquire to determine the legality of a price fixing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.820" offset="16383269">If it's illegal per se, you just inquire -- is it a price fixing agreement and if it is, it's bad."</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.843" offset="16427363">Now it's in that sense that I say that when such a doctrine is invoked, its full power should be appreciated and I doubt that the Government counsel have fully appreciated the significance of the concept to which they're urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.430" offset="16541675">I think they did in certain language, at page 31 of their brief, where they take Judge Murphy to test by saying it is a contradiction in terms to say as the Court did that the per se doctrine is in applicable "absent a factual showing of illegality."</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.697" offset="16622759">The whole import, says Government counsel, of the per se doctrine is that no such factual showing of illegality need be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.256" offset="16661002">Well, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.220" offset="16664869">If I have the concept of -- of the per se doctrine correctly, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.728" offset="16686811">But then how do we account for what they say at page 27 of their brief, the bottom, when they say, "In short absent, a special exemption by Congress, price fixing agreements in or affecting interstate commerce are not only illegal but illegal per se."</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.964" offset="16771762">It seems to me they commit the same offense for which they take Judge Murphy to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.600" offset="16794331">I say that if there is anything left of the per se doctrine, it's a water down version and it isn't the inherent illegality, the -- the very essence of wrong and taint which cannot be rationalized into something right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="4802.952" offset="19211807">I like to address myself brief to the question which Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised as to the possible economic objections which Congress might have which reasonable men might have to price fixing between competitors which would perhaps not be applicable in equal degree to other types of resale price maintenance agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.710" offset="19350779">Before doing that, however, I would say that we do think this is a case in which the Court actually need not go beyond the plain words of the statute either to legislative history or to speculation about economic policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.770" offset="19431027">Because it is an exemption provision and these are words which are as plain as words can be persons in competition with one another and we have confession that they compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.602" offset="19478361">But if one does go to this question of economic theory, I would suggest that there are a variety of considerations which Congress might reasonably feel, would make it more dangerous to allow price fixing in this area.One of these is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.620" offset="19566446">If you allow competitors to get together to fix the price of product A, it may be that the understandings which are reached there will not stop at that point and that they'll flow over into forbidden territory</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.655" offset="19650560">There -- is every indication throughout the discussion of this proviso that Congress was afraid about getting together competitors that was enactment to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.466" offset="19697789">Maybe it felt that if competitors got together at (Inaudible) that you couldn't confine it within the boundaries of -- of purely trademark products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.115" offset="19744392">Then there are other considerations which we think might lead to similar conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.283" offset="19777097">We think that they are dangerous when an integrated manufacturer price fixes at the wholesale level which are not present with a nonintegrated manufacturer, it does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.946" offset="19831745">Because if a manufacturer who was also an important wholesaler, price fixes at the wholesale level, he is in a position to offer the wholesalers the advantage of price rigidity if they buy from him while threatening them at the same time with impressive competition if they buy from other manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.619" offset="19934459">Now, we think that that is closely analogous to the situation which the Court had before it in (Inaudible)</text>
