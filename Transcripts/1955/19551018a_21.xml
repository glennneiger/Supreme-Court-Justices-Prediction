            <text syncTime="10.585" offset="42318">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="55798">This case involves an issue of just compensation arising out of eminent domain proceedings which were instituted by the United States in 1947 in the Western District of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.789" offset="127060">The taking was made necessary by the building of a dam on the Savannah River, which forms the border between South Carolina and Georgia, at a location known as Clark's -- Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.246" offset="204904">The Clark Hill Dam is a vital part of a comprehensive plan which is pictured on this map which has been reproduced by the engineers from the engineers' studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.861" offset="271360">The Clark Hill Dam is a central part of the Savannah River Basin project and it's located at this point here, right at the tip of this brown area which represent the reservoir basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.912" offset="335621">The project has as its declared purposes flood control, navigation improvement, and hydroelectric development.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.432" offset="385672">The condemned lands, whose value is in question in this proceeding, are located some miles upstream from the Government's dam at Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.674" offset="438648">They have been flooded as a result of the backing up of the river by the dam or, otherwise stated, they are now part of the reservoir basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.576" offset="486296">Now, for this taking of its fast lands adjacent to the river, respondent is, of course, entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.104" offset="528405">Respondent, however, has been awarded what we believe to be a special increment of value to which it is not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.352" offset="577306">Whether we are right in that view is -- is the issue here.The increment has been for the so-called water power value or dam site value of the lands condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.746" offset="638955">I might say that the award for water power value so-called was approximately eight times what the condemnee would have received under special findings which were made by the Commissioners if it had been concluded that such element was to be excluded from consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.248" offset="736967">I'd like to state very briefly, in summary form, without elaborating any of the propositions of this point and without discussing any of the cases which we think bear upon the propositions, the Government's legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.607" offset="806348">The Clark Hill project, we say, was undertaken in the exercise of the paramount authority of the United States over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.956" offset="855771">The respondent's land, it is true, was suitable for the possible development of a power project, though the Government had, in fact, built its dam at a different location which is mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.141" offset="928496">We say, however, that respondent had no legal, no established, no vested right to throw a dam across a navigable stream of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.410" offset="977607">Indeed, such action on its part, in the absence of expressed federal authorization, in the form of a likeness, would have been in direct violation of a statute which has penal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.649" offset="1046570">Therefore, we say, respondent cannot assert as against the United States exercising its dominant reserved powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.504" offset="1094008">A claim of land value which is predicated upon a use of the waters which it is not entitled to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.305" offset="1137162">Here, the United States, far from delegating its prerogative, as it might have done, has chosen directly to exercise them by a public project.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.447" offset="1189721">Now, before attempting to go further with -- with the argument, I am -- would like to go back to treat some of the geography and history, the history of the proceedings and some of the physical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.920" offset="1247608">We do so in some little detail because respondent, in its brief, has made a major attack upon the determination by Congress that this was a navigation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.133" offset="1308526">They argue that the Court should not so considerate.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.983" offset="1327856">And, consequently, I think, it's necessary to go into some of the background which led to congressional authorization and out of which these proceedings arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.356" offset="1493368">On the other hand much stress is laid upon the contention that it's not a navigation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.502" offset="1517923">In respondent's view, that, apparently, might lead to a different measure of compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.647" offset="3530501">Basic, we think, here, is the consideration, both from the standpoint of the navigation cases and from the standpoint of general eminent domain principle, this is a use which was not available to the condemnee or to buyers from the condemnee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.590" offset="4626286">The Savannah flows generally through the whole area that I trace with my stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.309" offset="4665156">The head waters form on the southern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountain here, and they flow generally in an easterly direction all the way down to the deep water in the Port of Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.324" offset="4737254">There is no issue that the Savannah is a navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.815" offset="4767242">The area with the stretch of the river which has been important from the navigation and transportation standpoint is the stretch from Augusta down to Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.357" offset="4817398">There's been as much as 130,000 tons of traffic -- water traffic in a single year on that stretch and the potential is estimated at something over a million tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.551" offset="4866194">It's also important to mention that this area here, this whole valley particularly below Augusta, has been highly vulnerable to floods in the two decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.170" offset="4920633">Between 1923 and 1942, there were more than 80 floods in that valley and flood peak -- flood peaks occurred in Augusta some-130 odd times, as we are told by the district engineer's report which Congress, in the 1944 Act, ultimately approved and, on the basis of which, it authorized Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.208" offset="5028780">Now, the respondent has placed a great deal of emphasis upon the fact that the Government stand here at Clark Hill.And, likewise, the Government stand at Park Ground, which was later authorized, do not have locks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.851" offset="5095340">In other words, they don't provide for the passage of boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.810" offset="5115193">It's also true that certain private dams, which previously vested in this area, indicated in black here, that they don't have locks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.022" offset="5168065">The reason that the Government has not attempted to provide for locks in the dams upstream of Augusta is that, though the entire river is a navigable river, as it's conceded by respondent, all of the significant traffic takes place between Augusta and Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.713" offset="5246851">We think it was largely on the basis of this emphasis that respondent convinced the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and, also, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which has the companion case which arises out of the condemnation of the lands from Georgia side of the river, that this was not a navigation improvement project, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.297" offset="5353117">The argument is that the Government that the points where the dam is built is blocking any prospective navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.947" offset="5387703">Now, we think it's clear under the decisions of this Court and, notably, under South Carolina against Georgia, and United States against Commodore Park that the Government can block navigation at one point on a navigable river in order to improve it on another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.894" offset="6799569">On page 38 of the record, I'd just like to refer briefly to a single paragraph which I think illuminates the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.573" offset="6838230">“These expert hydroelectric engineers,” the Commission has stated, “first, computed the annual cost of producing a definite amount of electric power by water, and then, computed the annual cost to producing the same amount of electric power by steam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.468" offset="6909806">Then,” as the paragraph goes on, “the experts took the difference and they capitalized it at 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.452" offset="6941780">And then, this capitalized value of the difference,” the report goes on to state, “between producing power by steam and by water was never taken as the true value of the hydroelectric site, but was considered as being of controlling influence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.631" offset="7018475">In other words, we think that what the Commissioners have done, as a practical matter, is to take the economic advantage represented by a hydro plant as compared to a steam plant in that area and say that the landowner is entitled to a valuation fixed on the basis of that economic advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.081" offset="7120248">We think, in practice, this is to afford the landowner compensation based upon the power potential of the stream which the landowner, here, had no authority to appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.217" offset="7464856">I agree that it might well be different if they were a large group, all of whom were in a position to bid for property for a particularly use, and that certainly might affect its market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.913" offset="7511562">But, we would say that special value to the condemnor is to be excluded and, indeed, if it is not excluded, the whole valuation process simply becomes a circle because if the market is free to speculate upon how much strategic value it may have to the Government, then I suppose, whenever the Government needs a particular piece of land, let us say, a strategically located link for a right of way, if the condemnees are going to be entitled for compensation based on the public necessities of the situation, that piece of land might go up a hundred fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.101" offset="7668402">Now, if the Court's function is not to exclude that, but merely to determine how the market or how the speculators have estimated the necessities of the public, then, I suggest that the valuation process would simply become a matter of the courts attempting to find out how much the speculators thought the Court would grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.065" offset="7772160">And, I think that the -- when this Court says that market value is to govern, that must necessarily exclude the special needs of the public represented by the Government as condemnor which, alone, can make and particularly use the property involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.068" offset="8056268">Much of the attack which is made by respondent upon the congressional determination, that this is serving flood control and navigation purposes, is based upon the fact that the annual benefits from the production of hydroelectric power are very large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.259" offset="8144980">Respondent says they completely overshadow the flood control and the navigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.526" offset="8178103">The flood control and navigation purposes were estimated by the engineers as providing benefits of approximately $300,000 a year, and it is said that the power yield is going to be something like $7 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.723" offset="8242887">And, the suggestion, I take it, is that the Court should, therefore, regard the flood control and navigation purposes as being completely unimportant as de minimis in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.038" offset="9560085">The case ultimately came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.893" offset="9571474">And, Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court in that case, said that the riparian owner's right of access was always subject to the contingency that it might become valueless by -- as a result of the Government project undertaken in the exercise of the navigation powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.015" offset="9652036">He went on to state that the authority of Congress to exercise these powers was not to be crippled, which is the language of the Court's opinion, by compelling some special compensation because expectant fees had been defeated or established uses by the riparian owner had been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.120" offset="9752451">The case, of course, upon which we think is most closely in point and even more closely than the cases involving impairment or loss of access to a stream is Chandler-Dunbar because of the peculiar similarity of the -- of the facts in -- in that case and this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.244" offset="9844924">Chandler-Dunbar was, of course, a company which, at one time, had a license to put works in the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.638" offset="9882540">It had operated under that license that it put works in the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.239" offset="9896856">It had drawn power from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.434" offset="9909708">The license, however, was revocable by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.025" offset="9928098">Congress passed a statute which revocated Chandler-Dunbar's license, and directed a public project in the interest of improving navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.369" offset="9973447">Now, one of the claims which Chandler-Dunbar made was that the federal project was depriving it of the flow of the river, which it said was very valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.016" offset="10020049">The Court rejected that basic claim, stating that Chandler-Dunbar had, perhaps under state law, a technical title to the bed of the stream, but the private ownership of the flow of the river was inconceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.504" offset="10082011">Chandler-Dunbar had another claim and, that, we think, has special pertinence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.641" offset="10110537">It said that certain of its fast plans which were being taken for the Government's project had special value by virtue of their proximity to the power inherent in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.586" offset="10154318">It said they had special value as factory sites because of the nearby power available, which we think is the exact analogue of the claim which is being made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.964" offset="10203847">And, I'd like to refer to what the Court stated in rejecting that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.111" offset="10252434">The Court stated, "That the Government always had dominion over the water power of the rapids and falls," which is the end of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.721" offset="10298828">And, went on to reason that it could not be required to pay either directly or indirectly for what was already within the Government's prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.548" offset="10346162">And, I think that that particular aspect of the Chandler-Dunbar decision was again emphasized by this Court in its Willow River decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.079" offset="10392242">I'd like to quote just one sentence from that opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.977" offset="10415856">Referring to the Chandler-Dunbar case, he said, "It held that the shore owner had no pertinent property right in two natural levels of water in front of its lands or to the use of the natural difference between as a head for power production."</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.527" offset="10526093">Now, that, again, seems to be -- seems to us to be a precise description of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.674" offset="10554619">If as sure, Twin City had no right to the use which forms the basin for its assertion of value, that value, we say, is not includable in the compensation for loss of property taken which is provided by the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.653" offset="12054570">In the Boom Company case, we had a corporation organized under state law, authorized to construct Boom's which are, of course, for the storage of logs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.935" offset="12223739">And, the Court said yes, and it said so on two grounds, both of which are important, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.550" offset="12250175">It said, in the first place, from its examination of state law, that it was perfectly clear that the condemnor was not the only one entitled under the laws of Minnesota to construct Boom's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.038" offset="12304091">Hence, it said this land had value for Boom purposes when it was held by the condemnee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.486" offset="13177940">Twin City, in 1901, formed these two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.181" offset="13200718">One in South Carolina and one in Georgia, and obtained the necessary state authority to build dams in this area of the Savannah River, comprising about 11 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.612" offset="13266442">They bought something less than 5000 acres of land and obtained six Acts of Congress between that date and 1919 authorizing the construction of dams at the lower end of the site, Price's Island and the other places there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.165" offset="13360588">This land was the gorge of this Savannah River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.482" offset="13373858">It is the steepest portion of that involved in the 37-mile lake which is Clark Hill, about 60 feet of the fall that owns Twin City property on the mainstem of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.631" offset="13430491">Its reservoir area included no buildings, houses, roads, anything that would add to the cost of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.708" offset="13470824">It composes about 88% of the drainage area which goes by Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.577" offset="13502276">And, on the Twin City property, some 45% of the fall in the river, which Clark Hill has gathered in its 130-foot head dam, is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.627" offset="13554416">For many years, Twin City itself attempted to develop this profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.887" offset="13583464">It also, from time to time, negotiated with other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.301" offset="13605198">It was considered in 1912 when Stevens Creek was built just below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.791" offset="13631112">It was considered in 1916 when the nitrate plant was finally put at Muscle Shoals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.472" offset="13657861">The record shows that the Secretary of War proved the Twin City plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.335" offset="13681267">A preliminary permit was tendered to it by the Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.927" offset="13699657">And, then, in the area between 1928 and 1932, when the Savannah River Electric had a federal power license to build, they negotiated and condemnation proceedings were started by Savannah River Electrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.983" offset="13763918">Savannah River Electric was one of the Commonwealth and Southern Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.923" offset="13779592">The depression caused it to surrender its license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.472" offset="13801848">The -- the property is well located with reference to a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.070" offset="13824209">Twin City owned the land to come out to the sea in W. C. Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.336" offset="13845316">It owned its transmission right away into Augusta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.756" offset="13862975">And throughout the last 20 or 25 years, all the Government agencies who have checked this have treated this property as being best used for hydroelectric purposes, either by itself or in conjunction with larger areas which, now, go to make up the Clark Hill reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.610" offset="13958374">And, the courts below have found that this hydroelectric use was its best use, that its probability for use in that was so probable as to affect the market value under the usual definitions of eminent domain law, and that a party would have taken that into consideration if it had engaged in negotiations with the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.445" offset="14101734">As a matter of fact, in 1947, when the Government started these condemnation proceedings, Twin City was negotiating again the Savannah River Electric to sale to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.954" offset="14151784">Savannah River Electric had applied to the Federal Power Commission for a license.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.097" offset="14292323">The Fourth Circuit did not pass on the power of the Federal Power Commission to grant the license, but held that the Power Commission had properly exercised its discretion in not doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.901" offset="14347598">The -- the Twin City properties alone were economically feasible for development at various heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.316" offset="14393260">The Government did not dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.292" offset="14401097">We brought in expert engineers who testified on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.616" offset="14426384">The Government's testimony was that a better project was to put Twin City in as a part of Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.279" offset="14461074">And, their witnesses testified that Clark Hill, at that time, was one of the two best projects east of the Mississippi, the other being the Buggs Island project with which this Court had some reference in the ronographics case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.186" offset="14520738">We approach this as our testimony and the Court so held on the basis of market value, taking into consideration the usual definition of market value which includes, not merely the use to which the property is already put, but any potential use which is so probable as to affect the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.492" offset="14637871">Now, that language was used by you in the Olson case, which is a case on all-fours with us, involving, as you probably recall, the lake of the wood, and in which the United States was interested in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.290" offset="14713104">The -- the dam was to be in Canada and the United States was condemning an aid of that project, but its interest was navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.417" offset="14749571">The Court held that the landowner had not made out the factual showing, of showing probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.317" offset="14781231">But, they laid down the law which the lower courts followed then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.524" offset="14798054">That is to say that if the factual situation is that of this potential use, being so reasonable as to affect market value, it is a part of the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.061" offset="14848209">And, that is the approach which we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.854" offset="14859389">Now, the award here is not excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.124" offset="14868480">It's less than one-half of the acre value which was awarded in Grand Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.688" offset="14898678">It's about the national average of land value per kilowatts, as the Federal Power Commission approached this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.804" offset="14935144">It's about 50% less for a kilowatt in stock of kilowatt than the same T-system, just North of the Savannah River and which is the most comparable system there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.086" offset="14988330">Now, we don't dispute the right of the United States to build this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.035" offset="15020095">What we are talking about here is the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.829" offset="15031275">There are probably several powers under the Constitution under which the Government could build.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.557" offset="15046217">Certainly, they could build under the general welfare since United States against Butler and some of the other decisions.It probably can also build under the commerce power, which is not limited to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.602" offset="15098358">But, we say that, in this case, the issue is whether the Government is relieved from paying just compensation or that part of the just compensation attributable to this feasibility for use with the river for power development because of the navigation servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.704" offset="15206713">The navigation servitude is much narrower than the commerce power, as you said in the Kansas City case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.128" offset="15252480">And, to relieve the Government of the requirement of the Fifth Amendment to pay just compensation requires something more than a finding that United States is entitled to build this project and to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.514" offset="15326041">And, so, we go into the Army Engineer's report, copies of which we have had reproduced in Court, which is involved in the statute to see what the United States actually did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.580" offset="15386227">You have the entire document before you and, so as -- I don't want to go into detail, but I do call your attention to the fact that the chief of engineers, in making this report, says that the Clark Hill project is to be operated primarily for hydroelectric development, on page 3 of the report, with incidental flood control and navigation of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.837" offset="15507331">In paragraph 8, that he also finds that perspective benefits would not justify the provision of reservoir storage space exclusively for flood control, but that Clark Hill, if suitably constructed and operated primarily for hydroelectric power, would incidentally reduce downstream flood damages and improve low water flows below Augusta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.563" offset="15622165">Now, on the cost basis, the estimate cost was $37 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.339" offset="15641287">And it actually cost about $77 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.258" offset="15660931">The engineers and sales allocated 96% of the cost to power and 4% to navigation and flood control.</text>

            <text syncTime="4074.204" offset="16296751">Now, we say that, to execute the navigation servitude in the sense that the Government is relieved from pain, there must be a real practical navigation purpose affected, not merely enough to justify Government construction or Government operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.435" offset="16389642">And, that's the reason I call attention to the percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.850" offset="16403331">We also call attention to the fact that Clark Hill is to be operated at a 25% load factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.115" offset="16428408">The Army Engineer Report show so -- shows a Government witness of the case so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.943" offset="16459755">That means that the water would be released to the equivalent to 25%, at the time during the times of high demand when power is worth more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.125" offset="16504477">Now, of course, any project as large as Clark Hill can benefit navigation downstream, depending on its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.376" offset="16537496">But, a 25% load factor hurts navigation or, if you're going to operate it that way, it rather than helps it, unless you can do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.256" offset="16580963">Now, the Government proposed that they would require this privately owned Stevens Creek Dam to reregulate the flow from Clark Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.245" offset="16632895">Then, it would be too big a sacrifice in the interest of navigation for Clark Hill to operate around the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.801" offset="16659122">Many of those hours, the power wouldn't be worth anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.055" offset="16672183">So, the fact that Clark Hill is to operate at 25% load factor is an indication that the practical navigation is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.189" offset="16712725">Also, in the report, these seven other projects upstream are all referred to as hydroelectric projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.310" offset="16753162">They have no navigation phases in it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.158" offset="16772598">And, there's very little flood control in it, as you will find on page 3 here of the Army Engineers report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.543" offset="16802168">They didn't even think it's important enough to have any reservoir space for flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.060" offset="16824216">The practical reason is that Augusta is already a dike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.582" offset="16838322">That's taken care of, and the swamp land down there where the river floods out has no sufficient value to justify this kind of expenditure by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.976" offset="16891820">And, then, we call attention in our brief to the fact that there's very little practical navigation to Augusta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.695" offset="16910733">In 1954, there's only 24,000 tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.053" offset="16928183">That's about 1 ton round trip for a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.453" offset="16945737">It had dropped from a 150,000 tons in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.900" offset="16967576">Now, with reference to the law, as I say, we don't dispute the Federal Power to build, construct, and to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.636" offset="17026508">The question is whether the Federal Government is taking private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.911" offset="17063602">Government concedes that our highlands are being taken, and they wish to subtract from the value of those highlands the potential use with the stream for water power purposes, what we call our proximity value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.013" offset="17139984">Now, having found this potential use, the courts below applied the law, which you declared in the Olson case and you repeated in the Powelson case, that this potential use, if it affected market value, must be considered as an element of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.720" offset="17238831">In Olson, you said the facts didn't justify that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.616" offset="17258371">And, in Powelson, you reversed and sent it back because they had capitalized earnings and they had valued North Carolina's right of eminent domain which is not private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.204" offset="17320751">In the Grand Dam case, which was between a licensee of the Federal Power Commission, not the United States, you reserved this question in Grand Dam, this potential was bagged by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and you affirmed here, saying that it was a value to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.428" offset="17433704">And, we submit that that case, in principle, applies here because it's not the value to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.046" offset="17484173">I agree with Mr. Spritzer on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.076" offset="17492219">It's what the owner losses.And, if the owner lost private property in Grand Dam to the state authority, which was the condemning body there, then it has lost property of the same character here to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.185" offset="17568705">As a matter of fact, the condemning authority must be either the United States or state or some corporation to whom one of the two has delegated the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.796" offset="17615099">Now, there is -- there is a line of cases involving the navigation servitude which I'd like to address myself to a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.587" offset="17658253">Probably, that came out of English common law, the fact that the public had a right to use the stream for passage but, in any event, it has become a part of the federal law under the commerce clause for the protection of the United States when -- when the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.352" offset="17793358">This protection of this public easement for navigation became a part of the protection for the Federal Government on navigable streams, and you have applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.203" offset="17844767">You applied it in Chandler-Dunbar, to say that the Chandler-Dunbar Company had no right to build these wing dams in this important St. Mary's River draining Lake Superior and had no right to the lower water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.025" offset="17916029">You applied it in the Willow run case to say that there was no compensation where no fast land was taken because the upper dam would have lost something of its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.511" offset="17962005">You applied it in the Chicago Railroad case, dealing with one of the Mississippi River navigation dams, to say that, as to that part of the Railroad property below high water mark, there could be no compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.699" offset="18038700">As to that above, there could be compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.749" offset="18054896">And, you cited it again in the Kansas City case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.633" offset="18074436">Now, those cases all involved real navigation and all involved property rights below high water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.367" offset="18125427">And, we say this navigation servitude in the sense that it permits the United States to use property without compensation is limited by two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.466" offset="18173806">First, there must be -- it's limited to the bed of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.714" offset="18210795">You said that in the Kansas City case, in the Chicago case, in the -- and, I believe, in the dissenting opinion in Willow run is Kansas City two, that its limited to the land below high water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.576" offset="18286237">Now, we are not here arguing about the 1400 acres which Twin City owns in the bed of the Savannah River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.594" offset="18318315">The Government didn't describe that in its condemnation papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.507" offset="18330018">We haven't made any claim about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.294" offset="18341094">That is the kind of land that they would be entitled to take provided this were a navigation easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.454" offset="18373799">And then, the second thing is that there must be clear showing of congressional intent to take without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.382" offset="18405460">You said it most recently in Niagara Mohawk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.727" offset="18418834">Now, let's go back to that bed of the stream and take this Chandler-Dunbar case which the Government principally relies on in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.191" offset="18452689">There were three issues in Chandler-Dunbar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.884" offset="18463451">First, whether Chandler-Dunbar was entitled to compensation for the water itself and for its structures, its wing dams which it had put below high water mark, and the Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.090" offset="18516323">Then, the question was whether Chandler-Dunbar was entitled to an industrial value for a piece of upland of that potential which Chandler-Dunbar said, “We are going to use with the water which we generate, the surplus water we generate at this dam.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.327" offset="18589257">The Court said, “No, you're not going to have any surplus water with which to make power and, therefore, this upland does not have any use in connection with non-existing power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.301" offset="18653100">The important thing in Chandler-Dunbar, as the Fourth Circuit emphasized, was what they said about the lock and dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.849" offset="18683298">Chandler-Dunbar had a piece of uplands which the lower court found was useful for lock and dam purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.225" offset="18728856">And, at that use was so probable as to affect its market value and they made an award for that use for lock and dam purposes, and this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.943" offset="18779742">Now, what difference -- what legal difference is there between the potential use of uplands for lock and dam purposes, which require use with the water of the stream, and the use of uplands for hydroelectric purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.644" offset="18858527">We submit to you that the lock and dam use is closer to the navigation servitude than is the water power use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.000" offset="18907951">The counsel's interpretation of federal --</text>

            <text syncTime="4730.753" offset="18922998">Now, the Federal Power Act, it seems to me, would interpret that statute as having taken property without due process and taken property without just compensation by the passage of the Act itself because, as we understand their argument, because we haven't got a Federal Power Commission license and because nobody can get it except by permission of a federal agency, the property has lost all of its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.445" offset="19041698">You rejected that argument in the Grand Dam case and you said there, as you did in First Iowa, that the Federal Power Act has conferred great benefits on licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.336" offset="19101257">It's true, it has attached conditions but it has conferred benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.402" offset="19121528">We also find support, we think, in the Monongahela case in which the Government -- United States condemned the navigation project on a navigable river, authorized by the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.310" offset="19185162">And, this Court approved an award which included the franchise for the navigation tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.503" offset="19221943">Now, with reference to the second phase of this case dealing with whether the Congress has, in the Flood Control Act of 1944, attempted to exercise this navigation servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.330" offset="19301251">We call attention to the fact that there must be clear authorization because you're getting into the feel of confiscation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.987" offset="19335941">You're getting into the feel of whether the United States can take without payment and, as both the Fourth and Fifth Circuit said, “That's just not fair.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.842" offset="19391321">And, so, you have required clear authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.993" offset="19415876">That is your language in Niagara Mohawk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.652" offset="19430504">In Kansas City, you narrowly construed that easement to require the Government to pay for the subsoil, the interference with the subsoil drainage, even though the improvement of the Government did not go beyond high water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.131" offset="19512424">You didn't put any water back on this man's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.512" offset="19526008">You just prevented his water draining out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.073" offset="19548264">The Gerlach case is an example of where, even though they were general references to navigation and flood control and, unquestionably, in that big central valley project out there, there are many legitimate navigation and flood control benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.032" offset="19628095">When it came to the question of whether these owners of the bed of the stream below the Friant Dam, who depended for their value on these floods, whether they were entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.967" offset="19691833">You found that Congress did not intend to take from them that bed of the stream even though it had the power to do it because it was below a high water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.447" offset="19741780">And, you treated it under the Reclamation Act rather than under the other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.782" offset="19775112">I may incidentally say that a part of the authorization for that Central Valley project is contained in the same Flood Control Act of 1944, under which, Clark Hill was built.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.426" offset="19821610">Of course, it's a continuing process and it's authorized many other places also.</text>

            <text syncTime="4995.516" offset="19982002">Well, the Savannah River Electric was willing to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.089" offset="19992346">They applied, actually, at that time for a license and carried it to the Fourth Circuit to attempt to get a license to build their concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.808" offset="20031216">So, we actually had two purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.793" offset="20039158">Of course, they were mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.111" offset="20048353">Savannah River Electric, actually, was going to build the identical project which the Government did build.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.845" offset="20083357">Under slight or different circumstances, I believe Savannah River Electric, rather than the Government, would have built it, but it turned out that they went in first, just like the Roanoke Rapids case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.884" offset="20139468">United States built Buggs Island and then the private company came along and obtained a license to build one of the other projects on the Roanoke River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.196" offset="20168725">But, they were two better as action trying to get out from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.681" offset="20186697">Of course, we couldn't sell to both of them because they were mutually exclusive and, had the license been granted to Savannah River Electric, they, rather than United States, would have been the purchaser or the condemnor had we not been able to agree here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.216" offset="20256810">Now, there's another phase of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.207" offset="20268826">In all of the navigation servitude cases where the Government has taken without a compensation, and I'm not dealing now with the damage cases, there has been a navigation improvement in the very stretch of the road which is being taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.788" offset="20371122">It's not a headwater proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.607" offset="20382407">In the Gerlach case, in stating the Government's argument, Mr. Justice Jackson, I believe wrote that opinion, pointed to it in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.420" offset="20433607">The Government relies on the rule that it does not have to compensate for destruction of riparian interest over which, at the point of conflict, it has a superior navigation easement to exercise what it gauge as the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.978" offset="20507899">Now, the Government claims here that they can take our property uptown for a navigation benefit found below Augusta 25 miles downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.069" offset="20556173">In none of the taking cases, under the navigation easement, has there been taking property at one side on the river for a navigation benefit to a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.374" offset="20621479">Logically, that means that they can take all of the lands up here, 100 miles away, for navigation help below Augusta.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.300" offset="20677172">Now, I realize that, in your -- in the damage cases, that you have said that there may block navigation at one point to help another, South Carolina against Georgia, the Scranton case, the Gibson case in the Ohio River and, more recent, Commodore Park cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.704" offset="20754808">But, damage by the United States is not protected by the Fifth Amendment and, in the absence of statute, the Government can do pretty much as they please with reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.644" offset="20814576">Now, I'd like to say a word about the absence of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.137" offset="20840490">As a matter of fact, that was the defense in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.463" offset="20861806">Now, the Government came in with a witness, an engineer from the Federal Power Commission, who testified that, after 1926 and 1928, the Federal Power Commission thought that a dam at this point was a better development of the entire river system than a dam at Price's Island above the mouth of Little River where we proposed to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.469" offset="20969848">And, they made the point that, since our identical project could not be licensed, wouldn't be licensable because, under the Federal Power Commission criteria, it was not the best development of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.384" offset="21041528">We had lost all power value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.684" offset="21058664">The courts rejected that argument and, instead, merely treated the Government's evidence, as it should be treated, as saying that our property were not only was economically feasible for development itself, but was even more of value as a part of a larger interest below, and we submit that that is correct, nor do we think there's anything in the argument that nobody but the Government can build because the Federal Power Commission has the right to license these projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.895" offset="21203487">Your Grand Dam decision said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.893" offset="21215504">As a matter of fact, that argument can be made that there is more navigation benefit to the United States through the application of the Federal Power Act in some of these cases than results to United States from this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.408" offset="21281541">Now, take the Ford case, for instance, up on the Hudson River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.921" offset="21303589">I believe the decision here is 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.642" offset="21314560">Mr. Justice Stone's case wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.200" offset="21332741">In that case, there was a navigation dam on the Hudson with a lock in it, a real part of the navigation easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.665" offset="21362625">Forged out a license to put a powerhouse on that dam and to rent the water from the Government and permission to put flashboards to raise the level, as a result of which, he raised the level on the tailrace of a dam on the Mohawk which run into the Hudson just above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.458" offset="21445799">And, New York court enjoined his maintaining those flashboards and you affirmed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.620" offset="21478400">Now, in that case, those flashboards action would have more navigation benefit than the 4% of this project which is devoted to flood control and to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.523" offset="21566067">You have -- you have in the -- in the Niagara Mohawk decision, you have permitted water rights, totally unconnected with fast land, to be evaluated in the federal power processes which means, ultimately, higher price to the Government if they exercised the option because you found in that case that the Federal Government had not -- Congress had not intended to exercise the servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.319" offset="21713189">Now, we submit that, in these cases, we go right back to fundamental eminent domain law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.594" offset="21750282">We have concurrent findings of Commissioners, two district courts, and six court of appeal judges, all unanimous that this property had such a potential for water power purposes, because of its proximity to the river, that it had affected market value, that this hydroelectric use was the best use possible for the property, and we approached it entirely from the market value view which the courts have found was the price which a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller for this very property.</text>

            <text syncTime="5735.839" offset="22943347">That Act merely has attached conditions to the use of the land for power site.</text>

            <text syncTime="5750.753" offset="23003011">As a matter of fact, there was a Federal Power Commission license in 1928 for this project at Clark Hill.</text>

            <text syncTime="5801.015" offset="23204049">That the cost must be attributed to navigation, to flood control, and hydroelectric power, as I understand it, that -- that's only for that -- those allocations are only for the purpose of determining which feature shall pay and how much because flood control and navigation are non-reimbursable items and hydroelectric is reimbursable, and they make hydroelectric pay as much as the traffic will bear, namely, as much as it can earn through -- through the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="5847.008" offset="23387951">Well, this is the way that they arrived at it, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.288" offset="23405087">They took the potential navigation below Augusta and figured out what it was worth in dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.128" offset="23432464">Then, they estimated that if Clark Hill operated on a 58% load factor and Stevens Creek, which is below it, operated on a 100% load fact so as to level out the river, it would result in certain losses of power for Stevens Creek to operate on this high load factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.058" offset="23536222">They capitalized that saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.922" offset="23555657">They -- they subtracted from the navigation benefit this loss of power on Stevens Creek, and then they capitalized the difference and arrived at a million-and-three, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.239" offset="23604872">That's the way they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.937" offset="23611664">Now, when the army engineer testified before Congress in a footnote which we have in the brief, he went at it a different way.He went at it from the viewpoint of benefits and he took these same benefits and figured the power benefit at eight million, or whatever it was, and he worked that it happened to come out about the same percentage as capital cost, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.953" offset="23711765">But, I don't think we have minimized navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.908" offset="23731618">And, unquestionably, the stream flow could be further improved if there's any occasion to do it, but actual navigation has dropped from a 150,000 tons to 24,000 tons over about an eight-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.475" offset="23801835">And, the 24,000 tons is after Clark Hill went into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.564" offset="23818240">The first unit went in, in the late 1952 and the last unit in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.949" offset="23839765">As I recall it, they have 280,000 kilowatts and 740,000 units.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.397" offset="23865574">We are not saying that there isn't an incidental benefit to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.903" offset="23887517">We are not saying that it isn't an incidental benefit to flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.012" offset="23907997">The army didn't think it was worthwhile to put any extra storage and buy him a landfill, but any, with -- rather reporting what it is today, a dam of that size would certainly be let down in advance of heavy rains and would catch some of the flood control waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.848" offset="23979363">But, we are saying that it isn't the clear authorization, as you said in Niagara Mohawk was necessary, to permit the Federal Government to take property without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.606" offset="24038400">Now, we agree that when you are finding a federal authorization -- a federal power to do this or that, you must engage in all the presumptions of validity but out of deference to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.148" offset="24092526">But, here, what we are doing is we're talking about confiscation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6037.650" offset="24150518">They'd spent a great deal of money on the project and a private company, as Judge Potter said in the Fourth Circuit, certainly would have had to pay this kind of a value.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.156" offset="24196598">It's not a -- it's not an excessive value.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.407" offset="24209554">It represents, out of the $77 million, only less than 2% of the cost of the entire project.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.429" offset="24249678">And, yet, on our property was 45% of the falling river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.046" offset="24272144">This was the heart, the waste of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.869" offset="24291474">We also say that, in connection with the consideration of the navigation thing, the emphasis throughout this engineer's report, we must operate Clark Hill at 25% load factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="6226.595" offset="24906292">As early as 1939, this project had been strongly endorsed by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.322" offset="24941192">And, it certainly seems clear as of that time, if not, considerably earlier, that this could hardly be considered a licensable project.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.803" offset="24991138">I emphasize that because the keystone of our position, I think, is that, while potential use affecting value is to be considered, that potential -- that use is a use to which the landowner or buyers from him were free to put -- to put the land while in the condemnee's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.272" offset="25096986">Here, we say, that use was foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.473" offset="25109838">Here, we say, additionally, the Government had expressly exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.804" offset="25135125">I haven't dealt with the language of the 1944 Act but it seems to us completely explicit as manifesting an intention to invoke in the full measure of the Federal Government's navigational powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.930" offset="25203670">Mr. Robinson has suggested that the obligation to compensate Twin City, and we agree that they're entitled to compensation for their property, the question is measure of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.663" offset="25270648">Mr. Robinson suggests that if the Government had licensed Savannah Electric, that Twin City would have been entitled to much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.257" offset="25312967">Well, if Savannah Electric had gotten condemnation powers, I certainly don't know that that would flow and, certainly, Grand River Dam, upon which Mr. Robinson relies for that statement, doesn't say that it is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.022" offset="25368033">In fact, Mr. Robinson has assumed the answer to the question which the Court expressly reserved in Grand River -- in the Grand River case.</text>
