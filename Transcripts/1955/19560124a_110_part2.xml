            <label>Mr. Charles E. Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- of this Court, the Dennis case, the one -- which are cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.622" offset="38452">And after reading them, he became convinced as was said by this Court in the Dennis case that the preservation of the opportunity to prove actual bias is a guarantee of a defendant's rights to an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.600" offset="134374">And the Court further said that the way is open in every case to raise a contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.561" offset="202188">Using as he should, the law is laid down by this Court, the Highest Court in the land, if he was in obedience to what this Court said in those case then indeed he was practicing the highest ethics that any lawyer can conceive of or practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.201" offset="320784">Then, he went further, and he read the records and the briefs in two cases that were one in our Court of Appeals of this District, and the other in the District Court, which are known as the Emspak case and the Weinberg case, both of which are cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.209" offset="432797">And he did that for the purpose of determining the appropriate means, whereby, suspected bias might be established as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.425" offset="497685">He, the petitioner found that the challenge in the Emspak case failed on the ground as urged by the Government that a defendant desiring to challenge the qualifications of government employees as grand jurors was under the duty himself to interview such grand jurors in order to determine whether bias in fact existed before applied to the Court for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.633" offset="666436">And in the absence of such effort and showing, based thereon, he was not entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.852" offset="699350">And he found on page 9 of the record of his, and he found as his guide by all the Court of Appeals that the Government had urged on our Court of Appeals on that day in the Emspak case as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.159" offset="784614">This appears in the Government's own brief in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.002" offset="799974">The appellant in this motion was not only asserting that at least eight of the 12 members of the grand jury indicated in this motion were prejudiced and disqualified, but was promising to prove this if he was given an opportunity, “Yet,” says the government, “there is not the slightest indication in the long motion and offer of proof that any attempt has been made to interview a single long of apportions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="235.756" offset="943020">So, in that case, in the Government's brief, my government indicated and complained of the fact that he should have in that case that defendant or his counsel interviewed grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.544" offset="1022119">Even the Government at that very point sets up and suggests the guy to a lawyer, for it says and complaints about his failure to interview grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.670" offset="1078648">Then, it went on to say under all of the circumstances that it's clear that the Court acted properly in denying the motion for a hearing in the absence of any reason for appellant, not making his whole showing in the usual form of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.141" offset="1152522">It can be asserted on this review that the trial judge had exclusive discretion to deny a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.695" offset="1182720">And then, the Government went on again and advised not only your petitioner, but all other lawyers in the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.601" offset="1222322">And it said, “The appellant was trying to get the Court to make an investigation which the appellant himself had -- should make.”</text>
            <text syncTime="317.457" offset="1269760">Now, when Cammer makes what the Government says should have been made, the Government now complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.054" offset="1308212">Was it not just for the petitioner, Cammer, to use that as a guide, the expression of what the Government of the United States thinks is the proper conduct for a lawyer in this kind of a case?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.263" offset="1376967">And then, again, the petitioner further learned in addition to this case and the others I have cited that the same issue was involved in the Weinberg case, and he then, as a lawyer should, investigated, researched and studied the file of that case, the briefs in the memorandums.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.039" offset="1492114">And what did he find there as his guide to what means should be adopted to establish the right of a defendant, to establish bias in a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.013" offset="1539971">He found that in a bench ruling by Judge Kirkland in the Weinberg case, Judge Kirkland upheld the Government's contention that a defendant could not apply for a hearing unless he had first undertaken to contact grand jurors to ascertain preliminarily the existence of bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.714" offset="1646759">And Judge Kirkland, speaking for the District Court and guiding all lawyers, said, “There is nothing to prevent counsel if he sees fit contacting those 15 members of the grand jury and enquiring on only one subject, whether or not they had any personal bias for the defendant and on that account did they return the indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.703" offset="1774759">That will appear may it please this Court as Exhibit A on page 13 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.208" offset="1844767">Thereupon, in the further step of this lawyer in the exercise of his obligations and duties, he has the District Court telling him that there is nothing in your way to go and contact and interview these grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.410" offset="1929613">Thereupon, the letter that was used in the Weinberg case and appears in the record, this plaintiff or rather, this petitioner copied that letter verbatim, except of course for the name to which they were addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.914" offset="2023654">The petitioner's questionnaire, which is a conduct complained of set forth the same matters that were contained in the Weinberg questionnaire, except that it was more condensed and Weinberg's counsel had sent the letter and the questionnaire for the judge had told him there was nothing to stand in his way of either contacting of grand jurors in a case of this type to establish that particular matter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="541.258" stopTime="542.711">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="541.258" offset="2165029">What judge did that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_ford" startTime="542.711" stopTime="1271.308">
            <label>Mr. Charles E. Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="542.711" offset="2170776">That was Judge Kirkland, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.165" offset="2188643">Then, after Judge Kirkland had made that direction to the attorney, then Weinberg's counsel filed a second motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.765" offset="2254994">And in that motion, Weinberg's counsel had set forth the letter he sent, the questionnaire and also a statement that he had received no answers from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.679" offset="2306612">Now, that second motion, I think Your Honors will find on the page 4 of the Cammer brief, or rather, on page 4, Your Honors will find the questions that were propounded in the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.590" offset="2398354">Now, when the second motion came on, it came in front of Judge Holtzoff, and at no time, when another judge of the District Court had this letter from the Judge Holtzoff criticized or in any suggest to recommend that it was bad conduct on the part of Weinberg's lawyers to file and send the letter or the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.716" offset="2554776">And in our brief, there will be found a statement that was made by Judge Holtzoff when he had before him a letter and questionnaire that was filed by Weinberg's counsel and he goes on to say that if he were a grand juror, he would close in the best of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.232" offset="2748918">And then, he went on to say that there was -- he spoke of the history of the grand jury on its impartiality and bias and it wasn't necessary for them to be so, but at no time, this second judge give any suggestion or him that it was improper conduct for Weinberg's lawyer to send the letter of the questionnaire and that was all that petitioner Cammer did and we respectfully submit that therefore, again, petitioner is using as his guide the law has set down by this Court by the standard set by the Government and by the facts having Judge Kirkland speaking for the District Court told him actually that he could do what he did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.593" offset="3006276">Now, may it please the Court, on the second question which I have proposed to Your Honors, whether or not this was an official transaction, if I may due to the shortness of time, I would like to adopt as my argument on that point the dissenting opinion our circuit in this case which was written by Judge Fahy, and particularly where he held that under this statute, this was not an official communication by an officer of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.713" offset="3218808">And in speaking of that in court, he said, page 15 of the opinion, “But when communicated by mail with grand jurors to obtain information in preparing his client's case, he was not engaging in an official transaction as an officer of the court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="828.158" offset="3312536">In other words I do not think Congress intended by this statute that's involved here, the grand courts, the power by summary proceedings to police such professional behavior of a member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.470" offset="3381812">The well-known avenues for suspending this party or otherwise disciplining the attorneys are available to reach their unprofessional and unethical conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.642" offset="3426534">The criminal law is available to punish them for criminal offenses where they will be afforded the normal safeguard surrounding the criminal prosecution and he cites Nye versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.246" offset="3476898">And contempt proceedings are also available to punish misbehavior of any person in the Court's presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice or disobedience or resistance to the Court's lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.884" offset="3547533">But the language of 401 sub (2), misbehavior of court, court officers in their official transactions is not at wording to include a broad suite of professional behavior of attorneys, not in the presence of the Court or so near thereto to as to obstruct the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.257" offset="3628931">The language no doubt does apply to the official conduct of offices of the Court, such as, for example, clerk and marshal, referees, trustees, masters and attorneys of fair and special capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.309" offset="3685146">And then, the Court went on and without delivering the point, may I adapt as by argument the dissenting opinion of Justice Fahy in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.704" offset="3726733">Now, may it please the Court, the third question.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.419" offset="3749616">Could petitioner be found guilty as he was of criminal contempt where the trial court found as a fact and Judge Laws sat, both his judge and jury, that he had a doubt that the petitioner Cammer's acts were committed in conscious wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.925" offset="3847628">Now, may I read a part of that opinion which appears page 26 of the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="980.888" offset="3923487">And I am reading the language of Judge Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.986" offset="3943863">“While the Court finds there is no question as to the impropriety of what respondent has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.262" offset="3989002">It is not without doubt on the record before the Court as to whether respondent's acts were committed in conscious wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.044" offset="4040098">There seems to be a reason to believe that the respondent may have misconceived the proprieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.054" offset="4080118">What he did was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.416" offset="4097567">There was no appropriate personal approach to jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.067" offset="4116167">There was -- there is indication respondent may have believed he had a right to propound the questions at the time he did, not withstanding the Court is of the opinion he had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.784" offset="4171128">Now, the Court -- the Government meets that issue by saying that what the judge was talking about was in relation to the sentence that he had imposed, which was a $100 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.651" offset="4242599">And throughout the Government's brief, it relates to the using the word mere and only a $100 fine, or greater than any money I possess is the integrity that I posses as a lawyer and as a member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.406" offset="4333610">I can conceive of no more condemnation than I can receive than to be held by an American Court in contempt of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.934" offset="4387736">The money will make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.092" offset="4404349">The issue in this case cannot be measured in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.675" offset="4430681">The only measure that can be made is that when a lawyer has a guilty conviction of contempt and of criminal contempt upon him in my judgment, his usefulness is at an end as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.846" offset="4515318">That conviction will long stand with him the rest of his life, and I submit that is the answer to the Government's reference throughout its brief to the $100 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.516" offset="4586057">Now, again, petitioner in his verified answer, which was not in anyway challenged at anytime, asserted that he did not intend nor did any of his acts obstruct the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.741" offset="4682919">At no time, nowhere does the Government challenge that as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.616" offset="4718446">In -- in fact, in a memorandum filed by the Government in this Court which will be found at the page, the bottom of page 7 of the Cammer brief, this Court will respectfully note that in the Government's memorandum to the District Court in this case of page 8 thereof, it stated, “Mr. Cammer disclaims any effort to influence the grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.873" offset="4859402">The Government does not charge such an obstruction of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.200" offset="4880718">Then again, on page 18 of this memorandum filed by the Government in front of Ross, Judge Ross, it goes on to say, “Here, it is not charged that Mr. Cammer's conduct amounts to an obstruction of justice and that it amounts to influence a grand jury on that Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.784" offset="4967131">We respectfully submit therefore, that in fact and in truth, this conduct complained did not intend to or did it and did not as a fact either tend to influence the grand jury or did influence it or obstructive in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.981" offset="5055843">Further, Judge Ross --</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.350" offset="5389375">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.800" offset="5403167">Petitioner's argument has stressed petitioner's duty to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.685" offset="5430648">And has found much more comfort in the precedence in the Emspak and Weinberg cases when we find or actually warranted when those cases were examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.447" offset="5489685">Well, what petitioner has wisely ignored in his presentation is the impact of his conduct on the grand juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.001" offset="5532003">He largely ignores what we find to be the controlling issue in this case, and that is the power of the judiciary to prevent behavior on the part of a lawyer, when that lawyer is representing an indicted client as counsel of reckon, when that behavior tends to interfere and harass an active arm of the Court in the administration of justice, in this case, the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.159" offset="5672542">We don't charge any intent to actually influence them with respect to proceedings against Mr. Cammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.493" offset="5705874">It's the tendency of this action to interfere and harass with the grand jury, a functioning grand jury, a sitting grand jury, which is what the contempt confession is aimed at preventing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.168" offset="5776614">It's aimed primarily at preventing future repetitions of this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.655" offset="5798557">The Court recognized that Mr. Cammer, the petitioner, was presumably acting in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.131" offset="5832516">They didn't question the fact that he felt that he should had a right to behave from the way he did and make the direct approach that he did, but it recognized that this conduct had a big potential impact on the grand jury, and that's what this case is essentially about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.593" offset="5922273">I could state the question I believe fairly simply as follows, whether the judiciary has the power to protect and maintain the integrity of the grand jury system, when the lawyer threatens the integrity of that system by communicating private on behalf of an indicted client with members of a sitting grand jury who are still investigating the same kind of conduct for which they indicted as client without first notifying the Court or receiving its permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.348" offset="6057378">If the Court in its discretion as Judge Kirkland did felt that a direct communication was the appropriate way to try to develop bias, that's one thing, but the Court should be consulted, should be asked as to what'll be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.671" offset="6130625">If this conduct is proper in this kind of case, it's proper in all cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.388" offset="8961463">The Court, they are speaking through Mr. Justice Reed, pointed out criminal statutes of course had to be construed strictly, but that doesn't mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.912" offset="9027605">Now, you could make an argument that Bramblett's conduct was not covered by that statute in the case, but the history of the legislation indicated that it was, and we believe that the same thing applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.428" offset="9081626">When Congress singled out, of course, the story of the first subsection of the contempt statute, misbehavior in the presence or so near thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.502" offset="9130005">I believe it's familiar to all the members of the Court and one time it was given a broad causal construction and now has a narrower geographical construction which appears to be correct in the light of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.599" offset="9186325">But when Congress specifically picked out the conduct misbehavior of officers of the Court in their official transactions with no such limitations as where committed, we find there a pretty strong intent to give the Court power to protect its own institutions from the unusually devastating effect of misbehavior by an officer of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.059" offset="9452147">Now, when an individual approaches on that subject, I think they feel we don't have to talk to you and before a lawyer approaches him, he says, “I'm representing this particular client and in the interest of justice, you have a duty,” and those are the words he used on page 2 and 3 -- excuse me, Your Honor, page 3 and 4 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.825" offset="12399282">If this Court felt that the jury, the right of trial by jury was so important, they could, by the rule or through their power to supervise the proceedings of the Court adopt such a rule, BUT that is not a reason it seems to us for emasculating the contempt statute.</text>
