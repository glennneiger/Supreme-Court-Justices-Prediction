            <label>Mr. Bernard Chazen</label>
            <text syncTime="54.264" offset="217025">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.768" offset="238968">I represent the libelant, who is the petitioner, on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.159" offset="272614">The case involves an application of he assignment provisions of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.733" offset="318903">I would like to briefly discuss the factual background first, and then come to the legal argument which turns on a rather narrow issue, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.338" offset="377313">The facts in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.410" offset="389538">The libelant and the petitioner here is a longshoreman who was employed by the Northern Dock Company on September 6, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.888" offset="435513">While working on a vessel in Hoboken, New Jersey, the SS Hoegh Silvercloud, he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.996" offset="475951">This vessel was owned by the respondent Oivind Lorentzen, the Director of Shipping of Norway and apparently was leased, at least we have alleged that it was operated, managed and controlled by Kerr, the Kerr Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.504" offset="573962">And they've never filed an answer that has not been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.037" offset="596114">Now, on this vessel, there was some contracting work which was done and it was done by a concern known as the Hamilton Marine Contracting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.300" offset="629133">They also are respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.017" offset="655987">The accident happened briefly in this (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="169.584" offset="678243">Mr. Czaplicki, while going on the vessel, stepped on some steps which had been assembled by carpenters near a catwalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.189" offset="716696">These steps were not secured and gave way.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.657" offset="730593">As a result, he fell, he was injured and he went home that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.961" offset="759745">He was treated by a doctor supplied by the compensation carrier, the Travelers Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.746" offset="802900">Now after that, the time sequence becomes important because I think it indicates the point which I feel is most important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.242" offset="852950">The employer made a report pursuant to the procedure in the Act on, it was dated September 6, the date of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.159" offset="884611">And in that report, substantially, everything which we have said was reported as to the manner in which this injury happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.300" offset="921182">On September 17th, about 11 days later, a notice was sent to the Deputy Commissioner that this claim was going to be controverted by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.591" offset="966322">Now, this notice appears at 71 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.420" offset="981577">And I'd like to call the Court's attention to the fact that on the notice, there are several specific grounds listed why the claim would be controverted, the cause of relationship, wages, various points that are typically the basis of controverting a claim of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.126" offset="1060467">None of this was checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.368" offset="1069453">And under other reasons, the -- the Travelers Insurance Company or rather the only reason the Travelers Insurance Company stated was under a clause stated, called other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.888" offset="1119504">And the reason they gave was that the injured is undecided whether or not to sue a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.641" offset="1150537">So that the specific purpose of controverting this claim, 11 days after it happened and while the man was still under treatment was for the purpose of forcing him at that point to elect to take compensation or to give up his right and give up his right against any possible third party who would be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.225" offset="1256803">Now, an affidavit has been filed in the course of one of the motions by the libelant.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.511" offset="1294002">And he stated that it went to the Commission, he asked for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.439" offset="1321691">He didn't understand what he was told.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.893" offset="1331513">He was told that he would have to sign some papers if he wanted to get compensation and further medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.203" offset="1364741">He did.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.929" offset="1367667">What he did sign was a claim petition, the claim petition then enabled the Deputy Commissioner to issue an order, a formal order called an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.580" offset="1422315">Now, in that connection it appears in the record from the Travelers Insurance Company that this claimant was 60 years of age, that he was Polish and he spoke broken English.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.329" offset="1473306">And he got payment at the rate of $22.50 a week which is less than the maximum which indicates I think what his economic status was at that time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="380.524" stopTime="382.307">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="380.524" offset="1521998">Did he have a lawyer at this stage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_chazen" startTime="382.307" stopTime="1292.110">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Chazen</label>
            <text syncTime="382.307" offset="1529208">He did not have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.991" offset="1535896">There is a statement in the memorandum by the Deputy Director that he stated he did not want a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.738" offset="1558883">I think in fairness, I should bring that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.095" offset="1568287">However, he did not have a lawyer and I believe that in many of these cases, that's true before the Commission because the fees which are given for lawyers is not such that lawyers, as a general rule, are eager to take this type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.504" offset="1634011">So that he didn't have a lawyer at that time and whatever advice he got, he got from the claims examiner who was handling this matter for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.381" offset="1685420">Now, an award was entered or what was catch and then award and it said in effect that the man was totally disabled up to the time of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.598" offset="1726380">The award was dated September 28th and that he would get payment for total disability up to that time and that payment would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.989" offset="1775909">Now, that briefly, I think, states the facts as they concern the award that was entered and the procedure that was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.031" offset="1820108">Now, the first point that I would like to go into legally, is the question of whether or not the fact that there was this award without going into its character as making it effective as an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.419" offset="1885623">If there was an award, is the man powerless now to take any action to help himself as against the third party?</text>
            <text syncTime="481.057" offset="1924180">Does, this award operate as an assignment of all cause of action under all circumstances so as to prevent him from using -- by use of any procedure from asserting a remedy against the third party responsible for his injury?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.205" offset="2000771">Now, one other fact is important and it is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.513" offset="2021982">And that is that the Hamilton Marine Contracting Company was subsequently discovered to insure for liability, to be insured for liability by the same Travelers Insurance Company that was the compensation carrier paid the award and took unto itself the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.529" offset="2110067">Now, there's nothing in this record, there is no statement by them that they ever advised the man, at anytime, that they had an inconsistent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.518" offset="2161998">That they forced the man by the procedure, which they followed to take an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.980" offset="2191882">There is some statement by the Deputy Commissioner and by the claims examiner that the effect of the taking an award was explained to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.339" offset="2233260">If it was explained to him and if he did understand which he denies, the effect of it was merely to give the employer the right to proceed against the third party, to use his discretion as to whether he would compromise or institute suit and if he was successful in obtaining an amount of money in excess of the money which would be paid on the comp, Mr. Czaplicki would be entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.030" offset="2340049">He would get a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.030" offset="2352065">Certainly, there is nothing in the record which indicates that because the Travelers Insurance Company here, represented the contractor that it certainly would not dream or certainly it would be foolish if it dreamed of instituting suit when it would have to pay the eventual bill if the litigation was successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.156" offset="2464601">Now, this Court recently had this very problem suggested to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.787" offset="2507128">In connection with the case of Ryan Stevedoring versus Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.150" offset="2536594">And in that case, the Court held that under certain circumstances, a shipowner could claim indemnity from the longshoreman's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.522" offset="2602005">And Mr. Justice Black, in speaking in the dissent, pointed out the great problem which is created by this decision because it puts the employer in an inconsistent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.990" offset="2675879">It puts the employer in the position where if he decides to pursue the third party responsible, he may very well find himself in the position where he will have to pay the whole bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.948" offset="2739722">And rather that invite that danger, it would be easier for him to force an award to take the cause of action and to kill it.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.563" offset="2790191">In the course of Mr. Justice Black's opinion, he states that it was suggested to the -- to the Court that the courts would protect employees under the circumstances which he discussed in the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.820" offset="2863229">Now, the problem there is similar to the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.376" offset="2881411">Only here, the problem is much more aggravated and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.759" offset="2898965">Here it isn't the possibility the Travelers might wind up paying the full tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.732" offset="2918922">Here Travelers from the very beginning must have known that any successful suit against the third party would wind up with Travelers paying the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.315" offset="2969182">I might call to the Court's attention that in view of the fact that it seems to be the carpenters who failed to secure a catwalk or a stairway, that even if the shipowner were responsible under unseaworthiness, there certainly would be a -- a good claim by the shipowner over as against Hamilton Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.598" offset="3050371">Now, the court below, if I may, I want to revert now, to the history of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.976" offset="3099899">The libelant instituted suit against the vessel, against Hamilton Marine, against the owner of the vessel and against the manager of the vessel, the managing agent or the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.689" offset="3158727">The -- one of the respondents moved before Judge Sugarman on exceptions to have the libel dismissed as to wit, on the ground that there had been an effective award under the provisions of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.476" offset="3257887">And that this effective award made the libelant an improper party to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.615" offset="3290384">They also raised the question of whether or not, the libelant was guilty of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.448" offset="3325701">So that there were two grounds before Judge Sugarman on that motion or exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.042" offset="3360078">Judge Sugarman said, “I find that there was an effective assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.593" offset="3386305">Therefore, it is dismissed because the libelant has no right to sue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="852.628" offset="3410442">He specifically stated, “I do not go into the question of laches.”</text>
            <text syncTime="858.820" offset="3435207">The libelant then made a motion for relief on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.851" offset="3463314">One of the grounds of relief or request for relief was that Travelers Insurance Company be impleaded and that they be forced to be named as a party by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.095" offset="3520366">Another ground was that the defense be struck as to Hamilton Marine at any rate because of the inconsistent position of Travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.076" offset="3576268">This came up before Judge Goddard.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.556" offset="3602181">Judge Goddard stated, that in the absence of fraud, actual fraud, he could not strike the defense and denied the motion to implead Travelers or to strike the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.236" offset="3672921">The case then came on for hearing as to the parties, remaining parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.882" offset="3699461">They came on before Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.764" offset="3715030">And Judge Ryan, in view of what had happened before, had a hearing solely on the question of this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.634" offset="3754527">And he stated that in view of the decision of his -- decisions of his brother judges, the law in this case had been settled and he dismissed the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.325" offset="3805205">No judge at the trial level went into the question of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.599" offset="3834358">We then appealed to the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.196" offset="3848777">And in the Circuit Court, the decision was that while we had some ground for seeking to have a reassignment or ask the Court for relief from this assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.354" offset="3929339">That we were guilty of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.983" offset="3939892">So that the Circuit Court of Appeals without any further hearing, without any further evidence and without the issue having been passed upon at the trial court level, decided the case on the issue of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.256" offset="4024947">Now, our reasons for saying that we are entitled or we should get relief from the Court are basically these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.617" offset="4070400">First of all, we are dealing with a very liberal branch of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.021" offset="4096000">Admiralty applies equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.258" offset="4117002">Admiralty applies broad equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.367" offset="4133407">I have cited some cases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.300" offset="4145110">I don't think that anybody disputes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.645" offset="4158485">Secondly, the Longshoremen and Harbor-Workers' Compensation Act, as a matter of construction, is to be liberally construed in favor of the injured workmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.847" offset="4207386">Any result of that Act, any construction of the Act, which is harsh, which is incongruus, which shocks the Court is not to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.915" offset="4259631">It's to be given a liberal construction in favor of the injured workmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.153" offset="4284604">Now, there's nothing in this Act which compels the conclusion that in a situation such as this one, the injured workmen cannot have proper protection from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.712" offset="4354821">Now, let us analyze the Act as an overall unit and see what the Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.901" offset="4379585">The Act says, first of all, the injured workman is entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.966" offset="4403827">He's entitled to medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.927" offset="4411664">It says specifically in one section that even without an award it is the obligation of the employer or his insurer to immediately, promptly give what the man is entitled to under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.618" offset="4474462">Secondly, the access, if the man wants to he can file a notice of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.488" offset="4497868">He can elect to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.683" offset="4506645">Now, does that mean that he has an election in the final sense, in the sense that he takes one or the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.455" offset="4533812">The Act doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.500" offset="4541962">The Act says that when he filed a notice of election to sue, all that he is doing is setting up the priority of this claims because if he sues a third party and he loses, he can come back in compensation regardless of any statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.041" offset="4616150">He can come back in compensation and he can demand everything that he would -- have been entitled to under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.659" offset="4642586">The same thing is true if in the third party action he gets an award, which is substantially less than the benefits he would be entitled to under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.159" offset="4680620">So that the Act does not require a sacrifice of the man's cause of action against the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.105" offset="4712385">All that the Act does is provide that he elect as to a priority under certain circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.806" offset="7007190">And that because of that trustee relationship and because of the equitable -- equitable approach of this Court, that the District Court should have impleaded Travelers or should have worked out some procedure whereby the interest of all the third parties would have been protected and none would have been harmed.</text>
