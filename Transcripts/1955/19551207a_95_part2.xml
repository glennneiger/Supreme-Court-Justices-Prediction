          <heading>Argument of William C. Wines</heading>
          <turn speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="0.000" stopTime="680.340">
            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- inability of providing the fullest possible review for all persons accused of crime including free transcripts for the indigent at least, including perhaps the very best of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.477" offset="109819">The question here, as I was stating, is an important one, a deep one but it in one sense a narrow one as due process or the equal protection of the laws require with constitutional authority the affording of transcripts free of charge to those convicted persons who have not the means of otherwise procuring them.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.310" offset="257149">Before I address that question, I shall do my best to answer two questions, factual questions, not factual about this case but about the Illinois practice as to Mr. Horsky by Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.778" offset="343040">And as I understood it in slightly different fashion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter with respect to the so-called bystanders' bill of exceptions or the bill of exceptions prepared from someone's memory in condensed and narrative form and certified to by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.966" offset="447843">As to whether that's available in Illinois, I can say that everybody out there understands that it is but nobody has heard of its ever being actually used in a criminal case in Illinois in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.334" offset="517329">I think if you went back before the days of court reporting, you would find some but none today.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.553" offset="546168">And I will say that Illinois has not suggested in the brief that such a narrative transcript would necessarily or even generally be the equivalent of a verbatim transcript of all of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.270" offset="645016">I should also like to explain, so there can't be any misunderstanding about it, a little more amply than did Mr. Horsky, although his statements were quite accurate as far as they went, how transcripts are procured when they are procured under the Illinois Post-Conviction Remedies Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.737" offset="742922">That Act, if Your Honors please, is a statutory innovation in Illinois enacted, it's no secret in response to Your Honors decisions in cases from Illinois and other States in which Your Honors declared that the States must afford someway whereby in certain -- where there is a substantial claim of denial of due process, prisoners rich or poor must be afforded the means to attack their convictions collaterally by matters (Inaudible) the record when for some reason or other a transcript of the record would not make apparent those errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.837" offset="955246">Well, under the Illinois Post-Conviction Remedies Act, a prisoner is required to file a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.219" offset="984816">It must be sworn to at least by himself and accompanied by such other affidavits as are available or his own affidavit as to why such other affidavits are not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.766" offset="1046988">And if that question -- if that petition and its accompanying affidavits, when taken as true, make a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right -- of a constitutional right then it's within the discretion of the trial court to require a county expense, a transcript of all or of such portions of the record of the proceedings at the original trial as may be necessary to present in whole or to support in part the claims of constitutional denial by the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.455" offset="1273731">That remedy is available only to those imprisoned in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.988" offset="1295882">We understand it wouldn't be available to a person who has served his term but wanted relief from some kind of civil disabilities so that he could hold office or vote or something of that kind, its means of restoring liberty and not full civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.066" offset="1380206">Now, then the situation in Illinois with this slight amplification is exactly as Mr. Horsky has described it to Your Honors in his brief and at the bar this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.619" offset="1446452">Now, we address first the contention -- prisoners make two contentions with respect to denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.944" offset="1495771">The first contention that they make is that equal protection and due process are denied because Illinois does afford a free transcript to all indigent prisoners who have received the sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.366" offset="1577378">I don't mean in all cases in which capital punishment might be inflicted but has not given in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.265" offset="1609038">In all cases where the death sentence has been imposed, Illinois does provide a free transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.577" offset="1638296">Well, the petitioners say that as long Illinois provides free transcripts to indigent prisoners sentenced to death, it denies equal protection if it doesn't provide free transcripts to indigent prisoners who are not sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.860" offset="1727425">Frankly, I don't think that question need detain the Court very long with very commendable fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.227" offset="1764833">Mr. Horsky concedes in his brief that that question is not as important as the one whether the review by -- of convictions of prisoners who have not been sentenced to death or who have the money to get a transcript denies equal due -- protection or due process when no corresponding right is given to non-capital prisoners who have no money with which to procure a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.099" offset="1896385">Your Honors have declared as recently as the last term in Williams against Georgia that in Your Honors own language, "The difference between capital and non-capital offenses is the basis of differentiation in law in diverse ways in which the distinction becomes relevant."</text>
            <text syncTime="501.339" offset="2005264">And I think that the differences between a man who is facing death and one who is facing even imprisonment for the rest of his life are of such substantial significance that equal protection or due process is not denied if the one is given -- the first is given and the second is not given a free transcript of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.176" offset="2140682">The cases on the right to counsel alone are sufficient to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.078" offset="2168268">Beginning with Powell against Alabama, at the latest in cases where the death sentence has -- where capital punishment may be inflicted and with Betts against Brady in cases in which the death penalty may not be inflicted, this Court has consistently and steadfastly held, although not without powerful dissent, that the requirement of counsel in a case where the death penalty can be inflicted is categorical, it can't be withheld unless the prisoner knowingly and wait and understandingly waives it whereas in cases -- in state cases I mean, not federal cases in which the death penalty may not be imposed, due process is not denied by the denial of counsel unless there is a special showing of particular circumstances why counsel is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.263" offset="2453002">Well, as long as Your Honors hold that the right to counsel is imperative and categorical in capital cases and as contingent upon action will mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.865" offset="2503367">In non-capital cases, certainly the right to a transcript or gratuitous bill of exceptions is not of anything like the moment or at least has never been felt throughout the civilized world to be of anything like the moment as is the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.445" offset="2589780">So I shall not, unless requested to do so, argue further the question whether the fact that we do give free transcripts to those sentenced to death operates to deny equal protection to the indigent defendant, not capitally sentenced who does not have such a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.388" offset="2673476">I now address the second question in our brief which is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.795" offset="2715167">Illinois conceded --</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.887" offset="9647543">Well, it appears from page 85 that six States restrict the grant of a free transcript for certain types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.928" offset="9715670">Now, I submit that if there is virtue and merit at all in petitioner's contention, it must apply not only to all cases of felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.345" offset="9781290">I submit that if there's virtue and merit at all in petitioner's contention, it must apply not of only to all cases of felony but certainly to all cases that may ultimate an imprisonment whether either by direct mandatory sentence of imprisonment or by imprisonment as alternative to an unpaid and unpayable fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.555" offset="9882122">Now, the Chief Justice's question, as I understood it and I'm sure he will correct me if I have misphrased the question, indicates that the situation in the particular case of free transcripts is one that might be procured readily or easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.372" offset="9977417">Let me assure the Court that (Inaudible) is familiar from the case particularly if, as I think the logic of Mr. Horsky's argument requires, we take into account all cases where imprisonment may eventuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.653" offset="10054531">In Illinois, there are official court reporters who take down the shorthand but they'll transcribe without paying them in all felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.957" offset="10123807">Now, Mr. Horsky is mistaken about misdemeanor cases at least in the municipal court of Chicago and in numerous -- perhaps not in magnitude of sentences but in numbers of persons convicted, more people are sentenced to some kind of confinement from the municipal court of Chicago, I'm quite sure, than from any other court in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.344" offset="10837368">First, may I say that I think it does bear very cogently upon the constitutional question itself for this reason, that while there are some constitutional commands such as from the Federal Constitution that must have a trial by jury or the private property may not be taken without just compensation that it have to be where the -- if the Constitution commands something, that command must abided regardless of cost, therefore, I think everyone knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.824" offset="10975295">But whether the Constitution does command something, when that is in doubt, may well depend upon practical feasibility because the fact that it can't be supposed that the framers of the -- of the Fourteenth Amendment attended -- intended to create any right that they may have known would not be feasible of realization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.272" offset="11309035">But let's suppose for a moment that he's entitled to exactly the same thing that the -- that the opulent defendant is which is a complete merit whether he needs it or not, then you would have as practical matter, Your Honor, to answer your question as honestly as I can, you would have -- I would say several thousand Illinois prisoners, certainly many hundreds who are now indigent -- who are now indigent, the times of their conviction would range from two or three weeks ago to as long as 20 years or 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.965" offset="11515820">Most of those indigent prisoners would not have made a motion as did these indigent prisoners for a bill of exceptions within the time allowed by Illinois law which is not -- is 100 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.441" offset="11601711">But then you would get to the question if their pauperism deprived them not only of this bill of exceptions but of counsel to advise them of the need for it, you would then get -- you would then have this kind of a situation, you would have a prisoner who was convicted in 19 -- make it 10 years ago, he was convicted in 1945 and he's been given life for burglary, at that time he didn't have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.610" offset="11738384">He -- the 100 days in which he can ask for a bill of exceptions has long since gone by and he didn't ask what within the 100 days, but he now says, “Well, I was poor, I was a pauper and I not only should have had a bill of exceptions, I should have had a lawyer to advise me that I have a right to a bill of exceptions and that totals 100 days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.561" offset="11838171">And you would then get that problem if I make the problem clear without expecting the emanation of any answer to it.</text>
