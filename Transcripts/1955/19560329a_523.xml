            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="26.753" offset="106998">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.066" offset="112222">This matter comes here on a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.888" offset="151510">The parties are, first, the petitioners, Joan Collins, a widow, and her infant son, the defendant, corporation, American Buslines, and the defendant, Industrial Commission of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.628" offset="222459">Mrs. Collins is the widow of one Adolphus Collins, whose death gives rise to this action, and Adolphus Collins was employed as a bus driver by the corporate defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.715" offset="278779">Under the law of Arizona, the claim for industrial compensation, which is made here, will result and recompense being made, if any should be allowed by this Court, will result in recompense being made to Mrs. Collins from a fund which is maintained by the Industrial Commission of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.698" offset="358713">And hence, so far as Mrs. Collins is concerned, her only interest is with the Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.225" offset="384836">And hence, that is the only active or participating defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.044" offset="404167">The American Buslines Company is a Nebraska Corporation; it is in receivership in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.273" offset="429035">It has been duly informed and notified at all times with the process of this matter from the beginning to this moment, it has not participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.202" offset="464771">Should you decide the matter in favor of the petitioners, there will be a possible result in claim of the Industrial Commission against the Buslines, but that will be a separate action and will have to worry itself along, independent of -- of what we do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.479" offset="517851">Hence, this is a controversy for all practical and real purposes between the petitioner and the Industrial Commission of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.820" offset="559229">Now, the facts of the matter are these, the husband of the petitioning widow was originally employed as a bus driver by the defendant corporation at El Paso, Texas, and I believe, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.831" offset="639269">The company moved him from El Paso to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.765" offset="659017">And there, for some time, he operated the run from Tucson, Arizona, to Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.637" offset="682527">In the course of that operation, he became acquainted with and married the widow here, a girl from Phoenix, and they lived there for a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.085" offset="728294">Then, subsequently, the deceased was transferred by his company from the Tucson, Phoenix run to the Phoenix, Los Angeles run, an operation entirely in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.871" offset="791406">And at that time, he took his little family, then an -- an infant of a few-weeks-old and wife, over to Los Angeles where they rented a trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.431" offset="837695">And while he kept a mail address in Phoenix, he was in fact living in -- insofar as he had any formal legal residence, it was -- we will concede Los Angeles, in -- in the trailer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.895" offset="887536">His job consisted of driving from Los Angeles to Phoenix or return from Phoenix to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.222" offset="908852">The mileage was approximately 60% in California, about 40% in our own State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.869" offset="947409">The company, as I say, has been in financial difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.773" offset="959007">Whether that does or does not account for the incident, I have no idea at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.420" offset="973636">We've merely speculated, but it was in any case using retread tires and one of them blew out at Wickenburg, Arizona, killing Adolphus Henry Collins in the resulting crash.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.242" offset="1024940">His widow instituted proceedings for industrial compensation in the State of Arizona before the Industrial Commission there.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.142" offset="1056496">Let me explain that insofar as she had choice as between California and Arizona, she chose Arizona for the obvious reason, which is that Arizona has extremely high compensation in death cases, California, very low.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.912" offset="1107592">The California compensation would run something like $6000, perhaps, the Arizona compensation closer to $75,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.188" offset="1136744">So then, hence, she sought to -- to do what anyone would do under the circumstances, to pursue the Arizona remedy, if she had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.984" offset="1167882">This is the details, although, I think they're not relevant to -- to any matter, which you need to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.356" offset="1185332">Now, this matter then came before the Industrial Commission of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.192" offset="1204767">And now, may I mention the first of the two or three cases that you all ought to have in mind in the course of this discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.068" offset="1232248">That is the case of Watson Brothers as it had previously been decided in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.528" offset="1262028">Prior to -- a couple of years prior to this incident, the law of Arizona had been accepted as applying to employees who are either employed in the State or partially outside of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.348" offset="1325349">That question was reviewed in the case of Watson Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.930" offset="1339664">Now, the Watson Brothers case, please hold in mind, was a case that was decided before this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.736" offset="1362860">It is a case which was materially affected by what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.590" offset="1382296">In the Watson Brothers case, our Court took another look at the -- at its own Workmen's Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.790" offset="1415105">And it concluded that the term "regularly employed," which is the measure of coverage, could not apply to persons who were engaged at all in employment outside the State of Arizona, in large part because they fear it would be an unconstitutional burden on the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.265" offset="1493055">Therefore, when this case came along, the Industrial Commission did the only thing it could do, it held that it had no jurisdiction at all under the then prevailing Watson Brothers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.826" offset="1543210">At that point, following the normal Arizona practice, my partners appealed to this matter to the Arizona Supreme Court, and we asked the Arizona Supreme Court to overrule the Watson Brothers case and to restore the laws that had previously been.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.548" offset="1602142">That is to say so that the Act could be in general application for persons whether within or without the State in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.662" offset="1638609">And this, the Arizona Supreme Court was persuaded to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.049" offset="1660134">It said, “We repudiate the Watson Brothers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.479" offset="1673822">We decide that our law which is meant to be generous have been construed in a niggardly fashion there, and we hold that our law does cover all persons who are employed in the State or outside the State, at least where the injury occurs within the State."</text>
            <text syncTime="437.018" offset="1748010">But then, they went to having repudiated, that was their word.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.835" offset="1759295">They -- they had rejected the Watson Brothers case entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.465" offset="1777789">The Court then went on to the exact immediate situation and it held that our law could not constitutionally apply in the case of a motor carrier operator who was engaged exclusively in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.476" offset="1845812">In short, they held that the law cover the situation, but in fact that it could not that it was invalid in this one context.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.276" offset="1873084">They said, and I should explain that you have permitted us to come up here on a petition in which we have printed the relevant matters in the back of the petition for certiorari and that is where the opinion is and you've not had us redo it, they said and I quote from passages at page 20 and 21 of that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.478" offset="1945809">I'm quoting from the opinion of the majority, "We hold that to assume jurisdiction under our Workmen's Compensation Laws on the facts of this case would constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="500.353" offset="2001398">They said, "If the decedent had not been covered in California, then there would be no duplication upon which to find an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.754" offset="2039014">It is not the application of state Workmen's Compensation Laws which is prohibited under our interpretation of the Commerce Clause but a double application."</text>
            <text syncTime="519.817" offset="2079242">Now, let me make clear exactly what it was that was troubling our Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.815" offset="2099200">The Court did not have the impression that there was any possibility of double coverage in the sense of being paid twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.818" offset="2131174">The Court cites and analyzes the opinion of this Court in the matter of McCartney, and it recognized that the smaller award would be credited against the larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.117" offset="2164402">There's no -- no fear on our Court's part in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.462" offset="2181747">The burden to which our Court found was the fact that the bus company would have to carry added insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.313" offset="2213198">The burden is the extra insurance which is required if it is -- are required to insure to cover the Arizona load as well as the California load.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.045" offset="2252173">The Court says at page 20 into what is the heart of the decision, "If we were to reach the result which petitioner wants, the only recourse of the bus company would be to establish protection from liability in all States by the payment of insurance premiums."</text>
            <text syncTime="579.747" offset="2318942">The threat of liability would require duplicate premiums, and it is this duplication which creates the undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.120" offset="2360424">It is the need imposed by the laws of our State to insure twice that constitutes the undue burden, not the manner in which the duplications it --</text>

            <text syncTime="993.086" offset="3972284">And the bulk of what is here, this Court disposed of last year in an opinion in the case of Carroll, which I think hadn't been decided when this matter was argued in Arizona, might possibly have led to an opposite result there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.738" offset="4030903">The situation there was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.626" offset="4042501">In the Carroll case, you have the problem of an employee who was hired in the State of Missouri and who lived in the State of Missouri, but who went to Arkansas to do his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.422" offset="4093597">And in Arkansas, he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.374" offset="4105404">The case up to this point is identical with the instant case but for one circumstance, and that is that the employee was not engaged exclusively in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.752" offset="4134975">He was a construction worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.727" offset="4146887">He made a claim in Missouri, actually receives some workmen's compensation, our person has not done that, abandoned it, went back to Arkansas and made his claim there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.277" offset="4189100">And the question was whether, under those circumstances, the full faith and credit clause require that he be given his compensation only in the State of Missouri, then to the State of his residence, the State of this contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.005" offset="4252003">This Court reviewed the subject over a period of the many years that that question has been before you, and you said, referring back to Pacific Employers Liability case, "That case teaches that in this personal injury cases, the State where the injury occurs need not be a vessel to the home state and allow only that remedy which the home state has marked as the exclusive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.492" offset="4357956">The State of the form also has interest to serve and to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.642" offset="4378540">Her interests are large and considerable and are to be weighed, not only in the light of the facts of this case, but by the kind of situation presented for we write not only for this case and this day alone, but for this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.626" offset="4450429">The State where the tort occurs, certainly, has a concern in the problems following in the wake of the injury."</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.880" offset="4475507">And thereupon, this Court went on to specify what some of them were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.115" offset="4492434">In other words, for full faith and credit purposes, you have now held that in the general run of situations, that would be most of the cases, the state of injury does have a right to give workmen's compensation despite the fact that the employee lives elsewhere and made -- then he's made his contract of employment elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.793" offset="4567144">Now, we can narrow the problem down still further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.940" offset="4579683">The question arises as to employees who are partially in interstate commerce or working for companies which are partially in interstate commerce but not exclusively so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.437" offset="4625659">Most of the trouble in this field arises from the Ohio case of Spohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.675" offset="4650632">In the Ohio case of Spohn, duly cited, it was held that where pure interstate commerce was involved, the state of the injury could not give recovery in situations such as the one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.630" offset="4714475">In that case, the Court did not cite or mention and it was apparently not aware of the Pacific Employers Insurance Company case of this Court which had been recently decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.617" offset="4758465">And it cited no federal cases whatsoever on the critical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.822" offset="4783229">Two years thereafter, Ohio modified its Spohn case, and in the case of Holly, held that this rule would not apply where the company was engaged in any intrastate commerce at all, even though the particular driver was engaged exclusively in an interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.982" offset="4863896">And this distinction was accepted by the Arizona Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.187" offset="4880718">There is no decision by this Court, square on the point, but what I am meaning to call to your attention is that so far as your decisions are concerned in the general run of situations, you have found that the full faith and credit clause does not bar compensation in the state of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.498" offset="4945920">And that the state cases, I have cited others, I'm merely giving you high spots orally, that the state cases have held, including even the court below, that the Commerce Clause itself does not bar a recovery, except in a case of a company, which is supposed to be engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, and only, that one Ohio case and this case, have held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.323" offset="5037244">The New York cases have gone quite the other way and so of others, which we have decided to which they have been duly cited.So, we then come down to the narrow point, which is before you now, the only matter which is in contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.273" offset="5101087">Under the repeated decisions, the state of injury can give workmen's compensation in a wide variety of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.753" offset="5127001">There is a decision covering almost every imaginable situation, except the one of the company engaged exclusively in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.947" offset="5159706">And the problem is, should there be an exception made in that area to exclude those cases and those persons from workmen's compensation in the state of injury?</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.819" offset="5203174">Now, the court below reached its result on the basis of the citation of only one case from this Court, and that was Southern Pacific against Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.141" offset="5248522">Your Honors are keenly aware that in a state such as my own, we don't get so many constitutional cases or so many commerce clause cases and these are not customarily familiar matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.756" offset="5286975">And hence, there is likely to be a once-bitten, twice-shy psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.910" offset="5307559">And the fact that our Court was reversed in Southern Pacific against Arizona undoubtedly caused it to be peculiarly sensitive to the teachings of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.646" offset="5346534">You will recall that in the Southern Pacific case, this Court invalidated a statute from my state, which put a limitation on the number of cars that there could be in trains running across the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.732" offset="5414870">This Court found upon an extensive factual record or in majority that this Court found upon an extensive factual record that the Arizona law, first, served no useful purpose, that it did not promote safety indeed that it impeded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.875" offset="5471399">And second, that it severely crippled traffic operating between El Paso and Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.293" offset="5497104">Against that framework, this Court held that that particular regulation was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.788" offset="5527092">We submit that that case really has no bearing on the instant case, that it is not authority for holding invalid, the state law, which we now have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.877" offset="5575471">Where there is no possible discrimination against commerce, there is no burden on commerce except to denote minor financial burden with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.095" offset="5608281">And where the -- there is a complete absence of the factors which influence some of you in the Southern Pacific case, because there, you believe, many of you, that transportation in the Southwest would be severely impeded or was being severely impeded by the Arizona law, and no one can suppose that such a result is likely to follow here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.056" offset="5712144">Indeed, the cases, the state cases that have considered the point, they are duly cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.925" offset="5731683">They've gone the other way, and indeed, I do not know of any case in recent years at least, involving a police power regulation such as this, in which you have invalidated a state statute, purely because of a financial burden where there was no discrimination against the interstate commerce, no serious handicap to interstate commerce and indeed, almost no burden at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.480" offset="5953829">And in the general run of the commerce clause cases here that you have been invalidating have been cases of actual serious or substantial burden or discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.621" offset="5998446">As for example, in Dean Milk, a majority of this Court supposed that the trade between Illinois and Dane County, Wisconsin would be rendered virtually impossible by the local arguments.Or in the Hood Mill case, you supposed that the same result was reached as for the trade between Troy, New York, and if I recall it correctly, Massachusetts, or in Southern Pacific, these are the recent major invalidations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.511" offset="6093949">In Southern Pacific, you supposed the -- the Arizona case that there was a very heavy and serious burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.469" offset="6121848">Now, here, we are dealing at most with the financial burden of most minor proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.992" offset="6147866">It is impossible on this record to demonstrate what that burden would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.984" offset="6163853">There is no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.317" offset="6169182">There is no showing at all of burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.142" offset="6180467">And I remind you that this Court in Southern Pacific held that it would not invalidate laws on this ground unless there was some actual factual showing, either in the record or which could reasonably be supposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.185" offset="6228637">But here, I don't know, but what it is worth, and I do not claim that it is more than suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.172" offset="6252669">We have appended such statistics as there are from the Interstate Commerce Commission, which may be at least suggestive on the particular subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.023" offset="6296033">If I may direct your attention in the brief of petitioners to the summary of those statistics at page 5, and you may assume that this comes from the most recent report of the I.C.C. and it's the best statics we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.706" offset="6350785">You will see that the percentage of workmen's compensation cost to the total cost of bus operations is something in the neighborhood of 6600 of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.516" offset="6406060">But that percentage covers all workmen's compensation for all types of employees; intrastate, interstate, the station attendants, all the rest of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.222" offset="6452872">I will not burden you here, but I have outlined in the brief and do suggest that the amount of actual increase of burden on the industry which would be required, which would be imposed if the motor carriers are required to insure to the highest jurisdiction through which they operate, is in the realm of at most a few thousands of one percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.027" offset="6684108">And normally, there is full insurance adequate to carry all kinds of -- of obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.939" offset="6703752">And why there should not be, for example, if the truck hit somebody in the State of Arizona, there is no doubt but that they'd have to pay compensation and they'd have to carry insurance to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.421" offset="6745652">And why the one small category of employee should be excluded from that protection is to me unfathomable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.690" offset="6774700">I'm merely saying that the workmen's compensation cost is -- is a very, very small amount and that it would be harsh in the extreme to interpret the Constitution of the United States to bar recovery in state of injury for the employee who is actually operating the motor carrier.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Franks</label>
            <text syncTime="1831.132" offset="7324526">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.842" offset="7347304">Speaking for the Industrial Commission of Arizona and the Supreme Court of Arizona in this instance, we bear under circumstances that are somewhat confusing to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.016" offset="7408013">I just recalled that when counsel was asked to state his proposition, he stated that in the negative and it is that negative approach that it -- confuses us, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.499" offset="7461930">The instant case has not reached this Court on the basis or for the reasons that were present in Southern Pacific versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.019" offset="7500069">In that case, the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona, as counsel has pointed out, passed upon a legislative enactment of the State of Arizona which placed certain restrictions upon an interstate carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.872" offset="7559419">The Arizona Court upheld the state legislation on the grounds that there was no burden upon the federal commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.083" offset="7596304">In that case, the Court or the State of Arizona took an affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.998" offset="7619918">It placed what was finally deemed by this Court to be a burden upon a free flow of commerce between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.281" offset="7665058">Now, it occurs to me that the type of argument, which was afforded in the Southern Pacific case, was positive argument on both sides, and I do not find that in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.543" offset="7730155">Here, in Collins versus American Buslines, the instant case, and versus the Industrial Commission of Arizona, they find that neither the state agency, the Industrial Commission nor the Supreme Court of Arizona gave sanction to any act or practice which could be construed to interfere in any manner with the free flow of commerce between the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.093" offset="7848333">On the contrary, if the Court please, such action was expressly avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.810" offset="7879158">And hence, even though we haven't been inclined to burden a commerce between the States, we find ourselves, before this Court, where an effort is apparently being made by petitioners to relieve the Supreme Court in the State of Arizona of any compulsions that it may have had regarding the effect of the Federal Commerce Clause when it rendered its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.930" offset="7983647">We fully appreciate, of course, the fact that this Court has, on occasion, taking jurisdiction in order to pass upon an interpretation of a federal statute by the state court or the state court seemingly interpreted the federal statute as a prohibition against certain local interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.395" offset="8065567">And the cases are cited in petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari which constitutes the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.277" offset="8101094">We still feel in the instant case that the Arizona jurisdiction should be left to its own state-level interpretation in the instant fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.425" offset="8149682">And it is in this connection that we appear and present argument in behalf of the state agency in Arizona that took the initial position in this case, pursuant to an earlier decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, the Watson Brothers case as counsel had pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.036" offset="8240065">Now, counsel for petitioner has taken the liberty in this case of -- of extending his brief beyond the actual paper record of the case and we certainly have no quarrel with that under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.857" offset="8307357">This particular case, if I might point out to the Court, reached the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona under a rather sketchy record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.387" offset="8365453">The claim of the petitioners was filed with this -- the Industrial Commission of Arizona, and a hearing was held before that body, and it was the record of that hearing that went direct to the Supreme Court to the State of Arizona on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.032" offset="8440059">The hearing record was rather sketchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.895" offset="8455523">The Commission merely made an attempt to ascertain whether a man was regularly employed in Arizona under the ruling of the prior Watson case, so the hearing was merely concerned with ascertaining where the man lived, where and was he employed, and whether or not he was covered in the State of California under the California Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.535" offset="8546116">And of course, the inquiry was made regarding dependents, the widow status, and the status of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.099" offset="8592300">The case, as I say, reached the Supreme Court of Arizona on that type of a sketchy record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.580" offset="8626260">And therefore, we find it necessary here to refer to some actual situation, some aspects of the situation which of course do not appear in the actual paper record before this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.425" offset="8701597">But I'm firmly convinced that there were many matters, all of common knowledge, to the members of the Supreme Court of Arizona when the decision in the case was entered, and that they must have had an effect upon the Court in the reaching of this result which we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.292" offset="8769097">The record here does indicate in the basic fact situation that we do have a carrier engaged exclusively in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.719" offset="8802847">There is no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.552" offset="8818207">There is no dispute over the fact that we have a claim for death benefits under the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act arising from the accidental death of an employee of this interstate carrier which employee was a resident of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.357" offset="8881424">He was hired in the State of California, and he was fully covered for workmen's compensation benefits under the laws of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.836" offset="8919249">His work, however, like many of the other employees or the interstate carriers, required him to be within the territorial limits of the State of Arizona at certain intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.198" offset="8976718">Now, the record does not fully show the exact extent and nature of the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act, and I believe that it is important to consider for a moment some of the peculiar features.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.920" offset="9031680">We can describe the Arizona Act as unique among the Acts of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.233" offset="9056862">To begin with, in Arizona, we have what is termed an "Exclusive Remedy Act".</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.866" offset="9079432">Now, that alone is not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.100" offset="9092389">Some other states do have the Exclusive Remedy Act but not all of them, and California, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, the States immediately bordering Arizona are in the latter category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.953" offset="9147768">They have Workmen's Compensation Acts, or schemes or patterns of Workmen's Compensation Acts which are not in the exclusive remedy cover -- category.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="2298.374" offset="9193430">Because that picture that gave this Court some trouble on your statute first came before us 25 years ago, whenever it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.738" offset="9222896">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.772" offset="9227076">I -- that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.273" offset="9249019">Now, in the Exclusive Remedy Act, in the absence of rejection of the Act by an employee prior to injury, the Act itself is deemed by law to be the exclusive remedy for the injured employee, and the exclusive remedy for dependents in the event of accidental death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.937" offset="9327700">The Arizona Act is also one of extraterritorial coverage and that employees hired in Arizona and regularly employed in Arizona, by Arizona employers, are deemed to be covered under the Arizona Act even though performing duties for their employer outside the territorial limits of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.495" offset="9429891">We didn't have a feature which truly makes the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.463" offset="9457789">It is an act of unlimited benefits from a compensation and death benefit standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.726" offset="9490808">Awards in Arizona in workmen's compensation cases are based upon a percentage of average monthly wage and permanent disability awards can continue for life without monthly or weekly limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.908" offset="9551621">Likewise, death benefit awards to widows may continue for the life of the widow in monthly payments based upon a percentage of the deceased's average monthly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.714" offset="9606792">From the underwriting and the actuarial standpoint, and in the fiscal matters pertaining to the administration of the Arizona Workmen's Compensation Act, the Act is one where the state fund is practically a monopolistic fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.512" offset="9682024">It is not an Act that attracts the interest of private carriers to any great extent, although, the Act is written to permit coverage by private carriers at the option of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.445" offset="9737718">Insurance rates, applicable to policies carried by the state fund in Arizona, the state fund administered by the Industrial Commission of Arizona, are made lower by statute than the rates applicable to policies carried through the private carrier companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.355" offset="9813368">Our Act, 29 years ago, was purposely written that way in order to ensure a bulk of the business in the state fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.694" offset="9854746">The compilers of the Act realized that the state fund could not pay the enormous benefits provided by the Act, unless it had the bulk of the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.561" offset="9894243">And therefore, the private carrier situation was discouraged, although, they were permitted to come in and write at higher rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.972" offset="9931860">The rates, which private carriers must charge if they choose to become qualified in the first instance and write workmen's compensation insurance in Arizona, are 10% higher than the rates applicable in the state fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.843" offset="9991314">Now, the members of the Industrial Commission, the agency which controls the state fund and which also controls the underwriting phases of all coverages under the Act, has no power to make a selection of coverage for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.222" offset="10064875">The employer has the option to ensure him the state fund if he chooses to do so, if he has the liability in Arizona under the Act, or he has the option to ensure by a private carrier or assuming that he can find a private carrier interested in his business, or he may become a self-insure under the Act by meeting certain qualifications regarding financial responsibilities, size of his operations and so forth, subject to the approval of the Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.861" offset="10211370">Now, I mentioned in this point that the Industrial Commission has no power to make this selection of coverage for the employer because one of the main arguments of petitioners in this case, in urging the desired result, is that the interstate carrier can solve all of his problems by carrying his insurance with a private carrier of insurance in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.917" offset="10315651">We say that such contention would make the private carrier coverage mandatory in such an instance if the Commission were to tell the employer that he must go to a private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.311" offset="10377195">And thus, the option, specifically given by the statute, would be nullified and certainly the employer would be discriminated against, no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.640" offset="10418469">The Act gives the option to the employer when he has a liability in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.435" offset="10449711">Now, particular attention should be given to the basis for benefits under the Arizona Act, a point which was a subject of comment by Chief Justice LaPrade in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.862" offset="10507389">A statutory basis, as I have stated, is the average monthly wage of the employee when we consider the employee in interstate commerce or I should say the employee of an interstate carrier disregarding the interstate commerce feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.734" offset="10602893">Such as the employee in this case, we find a man who has an overall average monthly wage, whether he earns all of it in Arizona or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.480" offset="10645838">Only a part of that wage could be deemed or have been earned in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.305" offset="10665169">And in this instance, with the state fund carrier, being limited to insurance premiums on the Arizona portion of the wage, our Supreme Court has made that observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.890" offset="10723474">A limitation in premium collection for this insurance would be on the portion of the wage of the employee earned within the limits of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.712" offset="10770808">And yet, compensation benefits are based upon the overall average monthly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.387" offset="10805499">Our Act is a loss of earning capacity act in which an attempt is made to partially at least restore the lost earning capacity of an injured man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.176" offset="10852624">And therefore, his overall average monthly wage constitutes the basis for compensation benefits and a great portion of that overall monthly wage, in this instance, is not the source of charged premiums to the insurance carrier, in this instance, the state fund of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.497" offset="10941962">Now, this latter situation, as I've pointed out, was the subject of comment in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.036" offset="10968085">Now, with this type of situation present, one can readily assume that the State of Arizona has had difficulty in administering its Workmen's Compensation Act, particularly with reference to those employees who were actually not domiciled in Arizona, but who might have occasion to come into the State or who might have occasion to cross over the State at intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.773" offset="11071007">And it is a fact, if the Court please, that there has been a great amount of difficulty in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.354" offset="11101414">Once again, I am pointing to some of the things, taking the liberty of pointing to some of the things that are not actually in the paper record before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.303" offset="11141120">Prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona in the Watson Brothers case, a 1953 case, cited in the brief and mentioned by counsel, the Industrial Commission of Arizona was actually groping in the dark, in the field of employers engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.841" offset="11239340">The Commission was attempting to cover employees of such employers while in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.757" offset="11266926">And in doing so, it had to consider methods of collecting premium and methods of determining accurate and equitable basis for computing compensation benefits, with premiums being limited to a portion of a wage, with compensation benefits being based upon a total overall average monthly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.706" offset="11354802">Interstate employers were constantly perplexed regarding the extent of their liabilities and their responsibilities in the State of Arizona and there were numerous controversies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.198" offset="11488758">The situation, as it existed in the Watson Brothers case, could only be resolved by a consideration of the entire Workmen's Compensation Act in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.157" offset="11536614">And the Court in that case gave them two conclusions, one, to the effect that the exacting of premiums from employers engaged in interstate commerce would constitute an undue burden upon the free flow of commerce between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.953" offset="11591784">And secondly, that the employees actually considered in the Watson Brothers case were not regularly employed in the State of Arizona under the statutory definition of regular employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4738.919" offset="18955598">In this particular instance, the employer, American Buslines, carried a policy with the state fund, but only covering their employees at the docks in Phoenix or the office help in Phoenix, not the policy, specifically, eliminated the employer -- the employees in this category because of the Watson Brothers decision which said, “We have no jurisdiction over them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.992" offset="19071896">But the claim was properly filed with the Industrial Commission of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.264" offset="19089032">There is no argument about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.338" offset="19097287">Our dispute is whether it's over, whether the state fund as an insurance carrier is liable for the payment of the benefits that might be due to this widow and child under the Arizona Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.625" offset="19154442">Now, of course, we still bear in mind that the widow is fully protected under the California Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.166" offset="19184640">And I believe counsel has pointed out in footnote to his brief that she did file her claim in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.785" offset="19219122">However, this probably had been held in abeyance pending this matter, but reserved her statutory limitation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.401" offset="19249528">The claim was undoubted or apparently filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.240" offset="19272934">If the Court please, our conclusion is merely this, very frankly, we feel that there were reasons for the Court's decision below resting in state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.989" offset="19327896">The Court should be permitted to construe its state statutes and that the federal question, which they injected into this case in their opinion, is probably secondary and that the State should be free to construe its own acts, especially, where they have placed no burden upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.882" offset="19443461">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4878.050" offset="19512111">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.425" offset="19517649">I -- I think by now, every member on the bench is keenly aware of problems and there is really, only moments more time worth -- worth taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.756" offset="19550981">You can see what happened, namely, that this matter came up to the State Supreme Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.669" offset="19570625">The petitioner there contended that the Watson Brothers case should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.372" offset="19589433">Mr. Franks contended, on the other hand, that it should be followed, that there were adequate reasons in state law for deciding this against the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.377" offset="19633424">It is, I think, reasonably apparent that almost to his horror; the -- the Supreme Court went off on a frolic of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.055" offset="19656202">It repudiated the Watson Brothers case that decided it was wrong but on -- this Federal Constitution precluded it from going the last step of the way.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="4930.594" offset="19722344">I would say, Mr. -- Mr. Justice, that -- that I should not have -- have been lied some about it because I know that our justices suffered pretty mildly over this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.765" offset="19766962">They were distressed as of course they would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.826" offset="19775216">And as you can see, from the earnestness with which all the points in view are expressed, that was a -- a serious and indeed troublesome matter of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.103" offset="19808340">Now, essentially, the only argument that is made here in defense of the opinion below is that -- well, I shall say not the only one, there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.780" offset="19847105">First, the no-federal question was decided because despite the extensive consideration by the Court, there are other unstated grounds which the Court had in mind, which accounted for its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.236" offset="19896842">Let me say merely that that cannot amount to any independent state ground, and an independent state ground of what would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.962" offset="19923801">Passage to which Mr. Franks refers at the top of page 21, I think if seen in fuller context, is not really as disturbing as -- as he suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.923" offset="19971657">At page 20 and 21, the discussion is full.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.591" offset="19982315">The sentence he quotes is, “We do not decline jurisdiction merely for the reason that the decedent was engaged in interstate commerce, but in view of an additional consideration that he was also covered in another jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.030" offset="20028082">If decedent had not been covered in California, then there would have be no duplication upon which to find an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.385" offset="20057443">It is not the application and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.900" offset="20063504">It is the double application."</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.139" offset="20068519">In other words, the Court is, I think, can fairly be said to be resting on a conception of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.308" offset="20097149">The other point, which is made by Mr. Franks, is that the law, as interpreted below, a creed of the constitutional limitation will create much difficulty and perhaps it will because it's a problem for -- for others to worry with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.516" offset="20153992">Beyond that, I -- I have no further comment unless the bench has questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.639" offset="20174472">Thank you very much.</text>
