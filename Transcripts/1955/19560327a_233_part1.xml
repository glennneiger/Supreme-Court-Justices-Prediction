            <text syncTime="19.322" offset="77218">This is an appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, three judges sitting which dismissed an action brought by the appellants to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.457" offset="145763">That order in turn was entered in a proceeding brought by way of a formal complaint by the appellants against four railroads, which are among the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.828" offset="203233">If the Court will permit, I would like to follow this plan of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.451" offset="225802">I will first describe the rate structure which led to the filing of the complaint then deal with the issues of the complaint, the disposition made by the Commission of those issues and finally with the errors of law on which we rely for reversal of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.120" offset="304379">The appellants collectively are common carriers by water, operate a barge service from Galveston, Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.633" offset="466442">And I shall hereinafter refer to them as the Danville railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.307" offset="3345136">That joint rate is $6.66, I noted at the foot of my rate chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.103" offset="3372408">Out of that joint rate voluntarily agreed to, there is an agreed division to the Danville lines of $2.26 and we are confident that in view of their general attitude towards barge lines, they would not accept any lesser division in connection with the barge line and the -- except with railroads for an identical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.400" offset="3461538">But the important circumstances stands here among these facts by which I've -- which I've told you is that the compensation of the Danville lines is less when the traffic is received from a rail connecting line and when received from a barge connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.241" offset="3532904">With the rates in this situation, the shipper requested the barge lines to work out a joint rate arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.762" offset="3562998">The barge line suggested the railroad that they make the joint rate from Galveston $7.67, based $1.01 over that $6.66 rate from Port Sulphur.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.106" offset="3624333">That is the common relation of Galveston to Port Sulphur in connection with the all water rates which the barge line maintain to various ports of destination.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.082" offset="3716284">Nevertheless, the receiver at Danville advised the barge lines that if the joint rate suggested were established, the barge lines would obtain part of the business that comes from this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.309" offset="3773231">The Texas producer of sulphur is in competition with the Port Sulphur producer of sulphur.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.813" offset="3799249">And in order to be on a common price basis, he absorbs the $1.01 rate difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.230" offset="3836865">With that absorption, instead of $9.17, the cost of the receiver would be $8.16 or $1.02 below the all-rail joint rates to the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.865" offset="3887438">And the shipper advised these barge lines that if that level were established, the saving would induce him to give part of his traffic to the barge groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.017" offset="4032052">The complaint before the Commission alleged were in two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.302" offset="4045113">There were allegations of unreasonableness in violation of Section 1 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.732" offset="4066847">And the Commission was asked to exercise the power conferred upon it by paragraph (d) of Section 307 which states as when there are barge-rail routes and I quote, “The Commission shall prescribe such reasonable differentials as it may find to be justified between all-rail rates and joint rates in connection with such common carriers by water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.315" offset="4169247">Then there were allegations in another category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.481" offset="4181891">The allegation was that the refusal of the joint rate arrangements led to a violation of -- paragraph (4) of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.997" offset="4231941">That paragraph as to carriers subject thereto prohibits, and I quote, “Discrimination in rates and charges between connecting lines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.760" offset="4278962">And the paragraph by definition includes, and I quote, “Common carriers by water subject to part 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act,” in the category of such connecting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.957" offset="4335804">The Commission dismissed the complaint in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.890" offset="4351478">My argument, if the Court please, will be confined to the Section 3 (4) violation based on the difference in compensation, the full local in the one case and a lower contractual division on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.822" offset="4415216">Mr. Friedman, who will follow me, will discuss the error of the Commission in failing to prescribe a reasonable differential under Section 307 (d) and he will also deal with the violation of Section 3 (4) which comes from the granting of joint arrangements in one case and not in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.365" offset="4493375">However, as to the latter, I would like to make one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.910" offset="4511556">All cases in the Commission's books and in the books of this Court, which involved a failure to establish joint rate with one carrier while maintaining them with another, had been found to be squalling violations of paragraph (4) of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.914" offset="4591595">The Commission excuses that despair treatment in this case on the ground that the railroad revenue from the all-railway structure is a depressed rate structure because the rates were originally established to meet barge competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.318" offset="4661185">That is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.231" offset="4664842">The barge competition is in Chicago and the $9.18 rate applied to Danville is a depressed rate to Chicago to meet all water competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.276" offset="4705071">There is no water competition at Danville, it's an inland point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.634" offset="4722521">But the Commission says since these rail lines have seem fit to depress their earnings in order to compete with all water routes, we do not believe that the National Transportation Policy requires them to further depress their earnings by joining with barge lines in differential rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.958" offset="4799739">If the Court please, the error of the Commission in that finding is that a -- a proceeding aimed at removing discrimination is aimed only at the relation of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.843" offset="4851357">The matter to be considered is only the matter of equal treatment and rate levels have nothing to do with the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.203" offset="4880718">Now, if I -- if you please, I would like to come to the main point of my argument to answer the question, is discrimination in fact, which results from unequal compensation for identical services, prohibited by Section 3 (4) of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.407" offset="4957623">That there is discrimination in fact that that term as commonly used is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.759" offset="4986984">It is equally obvious that it is not warranted by differences in conditions on the lines of the Danville railroads, the lines which occasioned the difference in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.112" offset="5032438">Consequently, if that difference is prohibited by Section 3 (4) of the Act, there is no room for a commission discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.005" offset="5071935">There is no room for expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.849" offset="5083324">As this Court said in Mitchell in 313 U.S., when the Act complained of is probably discriminatory and forbidden by the Act, there is no room for expertise on the part of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.795" offset="5191158">The Commission dismisses this proceeding as to the issue I'm discussing on a lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.337" offset="5213309">I quote on page 35 of my brief the false statement of the Commission on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.498" offset="5245910">They find in effect that if we -- if -- if we were subject both of us to join rates and the divisions were disparate, then we can have relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.085" offset="5284258">They find in effect that if there were no joined rates with either set of connecting carriers but they were disparate separately established rates, then we can have relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.961" offset="5327830">But the Commission says when the disparity is brought about as here by a division in the connection with the rail lines lower than the separately established rate that discrimination is beyond remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.839" offset="5379344">It is not within the scope of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.142" offset="5396480">The two sentence in which they make the finding read as follows, "The comparison is between a rate or charge paid by a shipper and a division of a joint rate received by rail carriers and is of unlike things."</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.374" offset="5441411">Basically, divisions of joint rates are the result of contractual arrangement between carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.141" offset="5464503">They are not rates or charges as those terms are used in Section 3 (4) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.842" offset="5487282">But, if Your Honor please, these are not unlike things as to these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.534" offset="5514136">We are injured grievously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.681" offset="5522704">We are disadvantaged just as much and there is equal restraint upon the movement of this traffic by the barge-rail routes whether the discrimination is practiced in the form here or whether it is simply practiced as it was in the Mechling case, as to certain portion of the Mechling case by unequal charges separately established.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.507" offset="7033940">In that case, the Commission had proscribed or approved on barge traffic to the east from Chicago grain, higher separately established rates that were applied on all-rail traffic from that territory west of the Mississippi River where the all-rail traffic moved on combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.478" offset="7113874">This Court struck that down on the ground that it was in the absence of a difference in cost, there could be no difference in the compensation exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.935" offset="7151700">If Your Honor please, in that same case, from points in Illinois, there were no combination rates on grain by rail application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.238" offset="7188898">They were joint through rates with divisions with Eastern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.856" offset="7211363">The Commission had approved a separately established rate on the barge traffic higher than the division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.779" offset="7235082">That was stricken down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.064" offset="7244173">This Court sustained a decree of a lower court which was carefully drawn so as to reach the divisional aspect of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.337" offset="7277296">And I quote the part of it on page 46 and 47 of our brief, “Where the decree in joining the Commission's order insofar as prescribes, approves, authorizes or (Inaudible) in any manner whatever, a charge for rail services in transporting east-to-Chicago, grain that has arrived there by barge that is higher than any rate or charge that is contemporaneously exacted in any form and under any guides for railroad services on the ex-rail grain from the identical origins.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.567" offset="7410207">And I call Your Honors' attention, if the Commission is right in this case and if the Mechling principle doesn't reach this case as the point which I'm discussing then there can be a hocus pocus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.400" offset="7469558">The rail lines, east-to-Chicago, in an effort to restrain the barge competition can join the western railroads in joint through rates and set their divisions east-to-Chicago so as to impose the same handicap and restraint on the barge servers that comes from the unequal separately established rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.879" offset="7559419">The appellants asked this Court to reverse the District Court and direct it to remand the case to the Commission with directions to proceed upon a correct construction of Section 3 (4).</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.623" offset="8114469">Yes, Mr. Justice, but we think that that is a question which is not reached initially until we first show the need for establishing the through routes and the joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.000" offset="8167967">In other words, we have not argued that point because we think the amount of the division is properly to be determined by the Commission upon remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.960" offset="8203807">The railroad before this Court not only the railroads going from East St. Louis to Danville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.295" offset="8241110">Now, absent any joint rail rate, the situation as far as the Danville shipper receiver is concerned would be as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.251" offset="8284996">If he would accept all-rail by saying the combination of this rate and this rate from Galveston to East St. Louis and from East St. Louis to Danville, he would pay $11.66.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.616" offset="8342361">However, if the sulphur was shipped from the mines to Galveston at a total cost of $1.50 and then by barge along the inland waterway and to East St. Louis and then again by rail from East St. Louis to Danville, he would pay not $11.66 but $9.77, approximately $2 less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.689" offset="8442671">So that absent a joint all-rail rate, demand to wish -- to take advantage of the slower barge service would have it reflected in a lower cost for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.513" offset="8490005">The railroads, however, have established a joint all-rail rate of $9.18, approximately 60 cents below the rail-barge combination rate and they have refused to establish a comparable relationship between the rail and barge transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.063" offset="8584150">As this Court has pointed out in the Mechling case, the inherent advantage of barge transportation is its cheapness, its inferior service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.071" offset="8624274">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.228" offset="8628872">It's slower but it's cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.821" offset="8639216">Sulphur is a commodity which has particularly well adapted the transportation by barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.930" offset="8659696">It's generally stockpiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.719" offset="8666802">There's no great rush on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.913" offset="8671608">It doesn't matter if it gets there a week sooner or a week later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.452" offset="8685714">It's relatively easy to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.331" offset="8693238">There's little damage in transit.</text>
