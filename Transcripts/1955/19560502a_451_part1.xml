            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="28.179" offset="112640">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.044" offset="120163">This is an appeal from a final judgment and decision by the Supreme Court of Nebraska which affirmed a judgment and order of the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, permanently enjoining the enforcement or operation of a so-called union shop agreement between the Union Pacific Railroad and the organizations constituting the appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.762" offset="243043">The background is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.997" offset="251925">The original Railway Labor Act of 1926 was silent on the question of whether organizations and railroad subject to it should be permitted to make union shop or closed shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.044" offset="336144">Apparently, agreements at that time were not particularly prevalent among the standard railway labor organizations, although it is indicated that there were some, in effect, particularly so-called percentage agreements requiring a minimum percentage of employees to be union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.511" offset="422034">However, what was prevalent was a practice of fostering company-dominated unions and requiring membership in such unions as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.944" offset="471771">Primarily, with respect to that situation, Congress in 1934 amended the Act to -- to prohibit completely all forms of so-called union security agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.974" offset="535824">In other words, carriers were prohibited under all circumstances from in anyway fostering or encouraging or the membership or nonmembership in labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.464" offset="601757">It outlawed there by the yellow-dog contract as well as the union shop or closed shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.348" offset="633313">By 1951, Congress took cognizance of the fact that the company union had to all intents and purposes disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.972" offset="679811">In the meantime, through the National Labor Relations Act and the -- as subsequently amended in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress had regulated the extent to which and unions in other industries might be permitted to make union shop agreements and prescribe the conditions for the making of such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.420" offset="789629">Taking cognizance of those circumstances, Congress enacted what is known as Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act that is set forth in our brief at -- at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.996" offset="875938">The substance of Section 2, Eleventh is that notwithstanding the probations of any other federal or state law, carriers subject to the Railway Labor Act and organizations organized in accordance with the requirements of that Act may make agreements requiring as a condition of continued employment that all employees within 60 days after the making of the agreement or within 60 days after they are employed, become -- and become members and continue to maintain membership in the organization representing their craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.127" offset="1048451">When the law was thus amended, the non-operating organizations consisting of the -- of all but the last two of the appellants in this case, served notice on all the major railroads that they wish to negotiate union shop agreements in accordance with the permission conferred by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.031" offset="1152104">The railroads by and large refused with the few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.784" offset="1179063">After considerable negotiation, New York Central, in Baltimore and Ohio, and the Lehigh Valley and a few smaller roads made agreements through dealings across the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.128" offset="1228487">With respect to most of the railroads, however, the controversy remained unsettled and approximately a year later, that is in 1952, the early part of 1952, the President appointed Emergency Board No.98 pursuant to Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act to investigate the dispute concerning the making of the union shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.904" offset="1339559">That Board held its investigations, made its recommendations to the president and recommended that the railroads and the unions should jointly enter into a union shop agreement along the same lines as those previously negotiated by the Baltimore and Ohio and New York Central and the Lehigh Valley with some recommended modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.026" offset="1444049">On the basis of the Emergency Board report, eventually, regional carriers conference committees were established in the east and in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.753" offset="1499011">No agreement could be reached with the Western Carriers Conference Committee, but in August of 1952, a group agreement with the carriers represented by the Eastern Carriers Conference Committee was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.670" offset="1554599">Thereafter, the individual railroads in the west were asked to subscribe to agreements in the same terms and most of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.557" offset="1598171">The Union Pacific was one and it included -- it resulted in the agreement here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.868" offset="1635370">Nonunion employees constituting the appellees chose not to comply with the terms of the agreement, but instead, instituted this suit in the District Court for Douglas County, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.692" offset="1698691">And in so doing, claimed that the enforcement of the agreement was contrary to their rights under the Nebraska Constitution and statute which prohibits any discrimination in employment on the basis of membership or nonmembership in a labor organization and which prohibits specifically any agreement providing for any such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.423" offset="1809659">The answers of both the Union Pacific and the -- and the unions challenged the applicability of the Nebraska law and set up as an authoritative and valid basis for the making of the agreement in question, the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.415" offset="1901610">In turn, the appellees challenged the validity of the federal statute both as being not a proper regulation of interstate commerce and as being violative of the First and Fifth Amendments as well as on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.227" offset="1980813">The District Court of Douglas County found in favor of the appellees and entered a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.235" offset="2028878">And that, as I say, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in the decision here under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.238" offset="2056882">The Supreme Court of Nebraska apparently recognized that Congress had the power in the course of the regulation of labor relations and the railroad industry to regulate the subject of union shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.222" offset="2124800">It also indicated that it considered union shop agreements made pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act as not violating any constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.921" offset="2179657">But if I correctly understand the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nebraska, it holds that because in the Railway Labor Act, Congress did not leave state laws concurrently to operate as it had in Taft-Hartley but instead expressly preempted the field that thereby -- therefore, the congressional permission to make these agreements must be tested in the same manner constitutionally as though it had specifically required by law that every employee be a member of the union as a condition of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.781" offset="2355096">Now, it seems to me, Your Honors, that the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is so plainly wrong that it takes but brief comment to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.110" offset="2408385">Certainly, the power of Congress has a part of the regulation of interstate commerce to include in its regulation the manner in which employer-employee relations are conducted, is too well-established to be subject to questions at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.259" offset="2477035">The Court has specifically passed on it a number of times first in Texas and New Orleans against Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks and subsequently again in the Virginian Railway against System Federation No. 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.676" offset="2538684">And that subject matter has included, at least since 1934, the specific regulation of the subject of union shop agreements or closed shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.239" offset="2588944">As I've indicated before under Sections 2, Fourth and Fifth prior to the 1934 Amendment, such agreements were entirely prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.452" offset="2629799">Now, Congress has not, at this time, simply turned loose of the subject matter and ceased to regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.336" offset="2661251">It has prescribed in detail the precise terms that may be embodied in such an agreement and has said such agreements shall be permitted to be made notwithstanding any other provision of federal or state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.298" offset="2737110">And incidentally, it was found in the Tenth Circuit Court Of Appeals in 1936 that the enactment of the 1934 prohibition invalidated existing checkoff agreements then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.576" offset="2798237">That was in the case of Brotherhood Railroad Shop Crafts against Lowden, 86 F .2d, 458.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.909" offset="2871589">I do not think there is any controversy at the present time that Section 2, Eleventh does in fact render state laws inapplicable if it is not itself unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.402" offset="2925505">At one time, that was my matter in controversy in this case but as I read the opinion below and the -- and the briefs of the appellees, that appears no longer to be contentious.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.194" offset="2988722">Certainly, it seems difficult for me to see how it could be, in light of the express language of Congress which says notwithstanding the provisions of any other law of the United States or of any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.172" offset="3052669">And the legislative history fully supports that that was intended to mean exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.004" offset="3084016">So we come to the question, is there any constitutional infirmity in the enactment of Section 2, Eleventh?</text>
            <text syncTime="782.751" offset="3130932">The appellees assert that it violates First and Fifth Amendment guarantees because the right to work and the right to freedom of association are limited through union shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.339" offset="3197283">Those contentions seem to me completely flimsy.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.306" offset="3213166">In the first place, union shop agreements are not themselves government act and they do not become the equivalent of government statutes merely because entered into pursuant to the authority conferred by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.008" offset="3287980">That may be illustrated with respect to any other collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.923" offset="3307624">We make agreements all the time, fixing wages, working conditions, and other conditions of employment, the number of hours per week and the rights of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.673" offset="3346599">Now, if Congress were to take direct congressional action to fix the rates of pay or to fix the hours of employment as it did in the Adamson Act, then of course, immediately constitutional questions arise as to whether the circumstances warrant that kind of restriction on the liberty of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.606" offset="3438341">But no such questions were asked when Congress leaves it to the bargaining of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.264" offset="3457045">And in the same way when Congress leaves to the bargaining of the parties, the question of whether they will or will not make union shop agreements, Congress has commanded nothing has restricted no liberties.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.913" offset="3511589">And if the party -- I take it , the argument is that if a party exercises what we call their liberty necessarily the right to go to object to that mode of exercising their liberty, coerced it.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.099" offset="3608346">That -- that is the contention, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.436" offset="3617646">But my point is that it -- it is equally true when -- when we make an agreement concerning rates of pay or other working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.216" offset="3668846">The other individuals in the craft or class may not like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.305" offset="3685146">They may not like the rate of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.890" offset="3691520">They may not like the conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.085" offset="3700297">When we put in the 40-hour week, there may have been many who would have preferred to continue to work to 48 if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.734" offset="3726838">And that was done pursuant to the same statutory scheme that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.912" offset="3759647">Now, the -- the claim, in other words, becomes essentially a claim on constitutional grounds to have Congress prohibit union shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.446" offset="3817744">And we say that they have no constitutional claim to have Congress prohibit anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.833" offset="3855256">Now, this Court has had occasion before to deal with the question of the union shop and closed shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.211" offset="3888797">Under the Wagner Act, closed shop agreements requiring as a condition of initial employment, membership in the union and permitting expulsion from the union of members and consequent loss of employment was permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.072" offset="3972284">And bear in mind that under the Wagner Act, the collective bargaining agent was as much closed with the statutory authority of being the exclusive bargaining agent as the union is under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.225" offset="4032888">Nevertheless, this Court had before it in Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company against National Labor Relations Board, cited at page 14 of our brief, a situation in which a closed shop agreement had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.811" offset="4091193">And then at a time which was appropriate for seeking a change in bargaining representation, employees who agitated for a different representative were expelled from their union and were fired from their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.464" offset="4161829">The National Labor Relations Board held that that was not -- or that that was an unfair labor practice notwithstanding the permission in the Act to make closed shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.978" offset="4211879">They said they had to reconcile it with the freedom of association, the freedom of organization provided in Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.826" offset="4243226">This Court said the Board was wrong and directed the enforcement of the union shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.197" offset="4272692">My colleagues criticized me for saying direct to the enforcement because they say all this Court did was to tell the Board not to interfere with its performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.124" offset="4308428">But that to my mind is directing the enforcement of the union of the closed shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.032" offset="4332042">And in commenting on the situation, this Court said, "One of the oldest techniques in the art of collective bargaining is the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.650" offset="4378540">It protects the integrity of the union and provides stability to labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.272" offset="4401006">To achieve stability of labor relations was the primary objective of Congress in enacting the National Labor Relations Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.572" offset="4430263">Congress knew that a closed shop would interfere with the freedom of employes to organize in another union and would if used, lead inevitably to discrimination in tenure of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.502" offset="4477910">Nevertheless, with full realization that there was a limitation by the proviso of Section 8, Three, upon the freedom of Section 7, Congress inserted the provision of Section 8, Three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.678" offset="4526707">It is not necessary for us to justify the policy of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.812" offset="4543216">It is enough that we find it in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.847" offset="4555337">That policy cannot be defeated by the Board's policy which would make an unfair labor practice out of that which is authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.463" offset="4589819">The Board cannot ignore the plain provisions of a valid contract made in accordance with the letter and spirit of the statute and perform it -- and reform it to conform to the Board's idea of correct policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.277" offset="4793051">So the question -- is the question reduced to one that's -- I put to you a little while ago, namely whether people can be bound as to the terms of resulting collective agreements, although they themselves was referred to be in addition here on different (Inaudible) carriers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="1220.020" offset="4879987">I -- I think that's what it comes to, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.891" offset="4899527">And I say the -- the Court has specifically recognized in connection with the Wagner Act that even a closed shop agreement may be permitted and that it is enough to find such a policy in the statute, it is not necessary for this Court to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.595" offset="4978312">And Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I noted particularly in your concurring opinion in the Lincoln Union Northwestern -- versus Northwestern Company and AF of L versus American Sash &amp; Door Co, you note it's what had been the situation in the railroad industry prior to the 1951 Amendment, which was still the situation at that time, but felt it desirable to comment that the wisdom of such a legislative policy is, of course, not for us to judge, again indicating clearly that this is a matter of legislative policy and not of limitation upon judicial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.672" offset="5162632">Well apparently, the opinion below would recognize everything that I have said so far as having validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.124" offset="5204428">But somehow, the Court brings itself to the conclusion that something different happens when Congress preempts the field and does not leave state law free to operate in a more restrictive fashion as is the case under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.446" offset="5273704">I can find no foundation for any such view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.382" offset="5289482">In fact, every indication was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.697" offset="5302753">Most closely in point, this Court had before it in Algoma Plywood Company against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, 336 U.S. 301, the specific question of what was the situation under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.389" offset="5369522">Did it preempt the field?</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.601" offset="5378403">You inquired into that subject and came to the conclusion that it did not because the wording of the statute and the intent expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.181" offset="5412676">But there is certainly no indication that any constitutional question would have arisen had you found that the field was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.075" offset="5448202">It was approached purely as a question of what did Congress intend and of course that is the only question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.066" offset="5476206">If Congress intends to make its regulation exclusive in a field where it has authority to regulate, no further action of Congress other than the expression of that intent is required for the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution itself makes that the supreme law of the land and old state law is rendered inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.218" offset="5564813">Now certainly, that presents no further constitutional issue with respect to due process or with respect to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.301" offset="5613192">At page 18 of our brief, we have pointed out the decisions of other state and federal courts on the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.672" offset="5650599">I will not recite them here except to comment that the statement there made, that the decision below is the only outstanding decision contrary to the constitutionality of Section 2, Eleventh is still true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.009" offset="5719980">The only change in the status of the litigation they have recited is that the Wicks and Jensen cases referred to as having been on appeal in the Ninth Circuit have since been affirmed by the Ninth Circuit on March the 6th and the petition for certiorari number 808 is pending in this Court on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.390" offset="5817469">Now, there's one other point which the appellees assert which I would like to address myself to a little more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.154" offset="5864594">It is claimed that union shop agreements raised issues comparable to those that the Court had before it in the case of Steele against Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, 323 U.S. 192, which I'm sure you all recall involved agreements discriminating against employees on account of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.965" offset="5979847">Now, while that case was decided or by construction of the statute, the Court clearly intimated that if the statute had not been susceptible to such a construction but certainly, a constitutional issue would have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.111" offset="6040346">Now, perhaps it would be sufficient by way of distinction of union shop agreements from racial discrimination agreements to say as Judge Learned Hand did in the opinion of the Second Circuit Court of -- Second Court of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Otten against the B&amp;O Railroad Company cited at page 19 of our brief, that the situation is total, quite a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.315" offset="6153195">Certainly, discrimination is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.727" offset="6166883">It's merely a question -- it doesn't become discriminatory because some people are willing to join unions and others are not -- same conditions apply to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.481" offset="6209829">And they are agreements which this Court has recognized as among the oldest techniques of collective bargaining rather than instruments of racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.956" offset="6275762">Mr. Smith</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edson_smith" startTime="1574.459" stopTime="2348.238">
            <label>Mr. Edson Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1574.459" offset="6297809">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.757" offset="6338978">The counsel for the appellant has not given the Court a very complete picture of the reasons given by the Supreme Court of Nebraska for affirming the injunction in this case against the carrying into effect of this union shop contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.278" offset="6413061">The Supreme Court of Nebraska held that Section 2, Eleventh of the 1951 Amendment of the Railway Labor Act, which affirmatively authorizes and attempts to legalize were otherwise illegal union shop contracts in the railway industry is unconstitutional because it deprives employees in the railway industry of their freedom of association, their right to work and their money in the form of union initiation fees, dues and assessments which it empowers the unions to collect in any amount without restriction as to amount and in for any purposes, they can spend the money for anything they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.929" offset="6623713">The -- the Court held that if the union shop amendment Section 2, Eleventh had been narrowly drawn for the purpose of meeting the objective statute, which clearly was the elimination of free writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.761" offset="6719007">If it were narrowly drawn for that purpose, it might be constitutional, but the Court found that -- that isn't the case before it, that's not the case to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.931" offset="6755683">The Court found that this statute went far beyond the necessities of the case and impaired, infringed, deprived these people of their constitutional rights as I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.842" offset="6807301">Now, in order to make the case clear, I think it's necessary to go into the legislative history of the statute and get some of the facts and determine how the statute actually applies and how it affects these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.275" offset="6893087">And I'm going to attempt to do that to a limited extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.756" offset="6914926">I have only half an hour in a case which involves the constitutional rights of some 300,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.015" offset="6952020">I'm going to go into that hurriedly and come back to the only issue which counsel for appellant urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.823" offset="6991203">They, in their brief and substantially in oral argument concede that this statute would be unconstitutional if it imposed requirement of union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.980" offset="7039896">The statute in and of itself did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.531" offset="7050031">Their argument simmers down to a contention that because the statute authorizes and legalizes the action of the unions in imposing union -- union shop contracts on railroads and requiring membership as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.296" offset="7137176">And the unions have done the actual requiring that this two-step operation is constitutional where a one step operation would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.109" offset="7192346">And I'll come to that after a little further background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.759" offset="7206975">Now, what are in general hurriedly here, the rules with regard to due process because we're talking about the application of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.640" offset="7270504">There are three rules, sometimes applied, one in the rule of rational basis which the Court has sometimes applied to ordinary commercial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.969" offset="7323794">Now, we say that there's no rational basis for this statute but we further say that it's not an ordinary commercial transaction that's involved in the rights of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.639" offset="7370501">A second rule sometimes applied is that the reasonableness, it's setout rather fully in the case of Nebbia versus New York and the statute must not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.582" offset="7430269">It must not go beyond the necessities of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.211" offset="7448764">And this Court has said, it results that in the -- the regulation is valid for one sort of business or in given circumstances may be invalid for another sort or for the same business under other circumstances because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.876" offset="7539461">I don't -- in defining reasonableness, this Court has used the expression that it's unreasonable if it goes beyond the necessities of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.208" offset="7584810">Now, that isn't the rule that we really think is applicable in this kind of a case because the rights involved here, freedom of association, as I shall attempt briefly to review for the Court is right derived from the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.073" offset="7652206">The right to work has been said to be one of the most precious rights that the people have and those rights stand on a higher plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.539" offset="7702152">The real and the -- the clear and present -- present danger rule is the one which we think is the applicable rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.841" offset="7731304">And under that rule of course, the presumption, if there would be any, in a statute of this kind which is rushed through the House of Representatives in one hours time on New Years Day without any -- with only seven minutes allowed to explain its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.588" offset="7798282">If there are any presumption of its validity otherwise, that presumption is dissipated in a case in which the Court is willing to apply the real and present danger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.470" offset="7849796">In other -- actually, the presumption is against its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.905" offset="7875605">Now, another subsidiary of that rule is that statutes restrictive of or purporting to place limits to freedoms of this category must be narrowly drawn to meet the precise evil the legislatures seeks to curve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.225" offset="7948852">Now, what was that supposed evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.822" offset="7959197">It was simply the so-called evil of free writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.710" offset="8002769">Now, if you would turn to some of the statements in the record by George Harrison, who was the spokesman for the Railway Exec Labor Executives Association, which was the sponsor of this bill before Congress, he made it quite clear that that was the purpose of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.930" offset="8135680">The Supreme Court of Nebraska found and said it is apparent that the purpose of the amendment was to get rid of free writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.482" offset="8161907">The House Committee so reported the bill to the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.613" offset="8182387">And Mr. Harrison's testimony, he says, “If we have to bargain for these people, nonunion as well as union, they ought to have to pay the bill and therefore, ought to become members of the bargaining organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.864" offset="8239438">And then you talk about union membership in payment of dues and so forth being like the chicken and the egg, didn't know which came first, but they had to go together, and so they should become members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.420" offset="8297639">And you went on to say the only thing, we are seeking is that those men whom we will let into the union should be required to support the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.206" offset="8344764">He didn't claim that this union shop amendment would help collective bargaining in any respect, what he said in that was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.005" offset="8379977">He was asked if it would strengthen industry-wide bargaining in the railway industry and he said, “No, I do not think it would affect the power of bargaining one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.060" offset="8432222">If I get a majority of the employees, devote from my union as the bargaining agent, I have got as much economic power at that stage of the development as I will ever have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.247" offset="8468898">The man that is going to skeg, he will skeg whether he is in or out of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.527" offset="8490005">It does not make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.206" offset="8508813">Now, that -- that's the purpose how far beyond that objective did Congress go in Section 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.015" offset="8551967">Well, let's talk briefly about freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.639" offset="8574537">This Court has said that the right of people to join together in a labor union, right of employees to sell organization as a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.813" offset="8635246">It's a right not created by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.578" offset="8646217">Some of these cases cited on page 59 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.325" offset="8661264">It was recognized by this Court as such in its decisions long before it was given protection by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.907" offset="8687595">In other words, it's a fundamental right, which is sometimes protected by statute but regardless of statute, it's a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.413" offset="8721554">Now, freedom of association has been recognized in other cases in a concurring opinion in the case of Wieman versus Updegraff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.113" offset="8756349">Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, "By limiting the power of the States to interfere with freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry and freedom of association, the Fourteenth Amendment protects all persons, no matter what their calling."</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.917" offset="8811624">It happened in that case, it was the teachers in the University of Oklahoma that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.716" offset="8838792">And this Court saved those teachers from being deprived of their right to work because of the exercise of their freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.568" offset="8890201">Freedom of association has two sides, of course, its freedom to join in an association and its freedom not to join because if there is only freedom to join, it isn't freedom at all, there's no choice, it's simply compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.427" offset="8953626">And this Court demonstrated that in the case of First Amendment freedoms, in the case of West Virginia Board of Education versus Barnette, the flag salute case where the Court said, "To sustain the compulsory flag salute, we are required to say that the bill of rights which guards the individual's right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind."</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.717" offset="9070864">The United Nations universal declaration of human's right -- rights has recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.196" offset="9108689">First, recognizes the freedom of peaceful assembly and association and goes on to say no one maybe compelled to belong to an association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.368" offset="9153411">And the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has said, "Freedom to associate of necessity means as well, freedom not to associate."</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.678" offset="9186638">Now, this statute affirmatively authorizes union shop contracts compelling these people to become members of an association, a labor union that have to join."</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.538" offset="9266051">That was made clear by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.550" offset="9290188">The only case on the subject was an arbitration case in which a railway employee under collective bargaining contract of the clerk's union said, “I won't to join but I will pay my dues, fees, and assessments”, and the union demanded that she be fired and the arbitrator said she had to be fired because she wouldn't join the union.</text>
