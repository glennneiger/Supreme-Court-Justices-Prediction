            <label>Mr. Charles H. Weston</label>
            <text syncTime="14.529" offset="58096">If it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.286" offset="69068">This suit was instituted late in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.431" offset="93623">The Government's complaint charged that du Pont had been monopolizing interstate commerce in cellophane from about 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.305" offset="145136">The complaint made certain other charges that they are not material now.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.466" offset="173767">After a lieu trial, the District Court ruled that the evidence did not sustain any of the Government's charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.694" offset="218697">The Court gave several grounds for its rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.734" offset="234893">The one which is attracted the most attention is that du Pont did -- could not have monopoly power over trade in cellophane because it did not have monopoly control over trade in, what the Court called, “flexible packaging materials”.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.346" offset="317336">The Court also held that du Pont did not have power to exclude competitors that certain agreements which it had made which allocated market areas were not in illegal restraint of trade and that a product patent on a moistureproof cellophane which du Pont had and which was in existence during part of the period covered by the monopolization charge was a defense to the monopoly charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.123" offset="468428">The Government is asking for reversible upon the ground that the Court seriously misconstrued the Sherman Act in its rulings on the various issues, which were presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.376" offset="533420">The proof which the Government introduced was entirely documentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.575" offset="554214">It consisted almost entirely of du Pont documents, agreements which was made, minutes of meetings of its executive committee, du Pont correspondents, internal du Pont memoranda and reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.636" offset="630491">This proof is contemporaneous record of du Pont's action and it comes straight from horse's mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.419" offset="673646">Du Pont put in evidence over 1000 exhibits and called 20 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.672" offset="706664">It also took 16 depositions and introduced in evidence summaries of these depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.350" offset="749296">The opinion which the Court filed is a very lengthy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.274" offset="769045">Part of its length is due to the fact that the Court included in its opinion 854 findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.580" offset="810318">Du Pont submitted to the District Court 854 proposed findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.965" offset="847830">The Court adopted all of these without a single substantive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.808" offset="875207">One of the findings which it made does not make sense on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.557" offset="910211">One of the proposed -- an error crept into one of the proposed findings and the Court took over this finding as it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.190" offset="948663">It did not notice that the finding with this error contradicted another finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.453" offset="973740">It was contrary to the exhibit cited for support and also did not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.977" offset="1007804">The Government does not contend that the findings were invalid because of the Court adopted wholesale, the findings which du Pont proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.678" offset="1054616">But we think its action in this respect is not entirely immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.464" offset="1081783">Du Pont's brief states that this case was meticulously tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.528" offset="1106024">I suppose the trial includes adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.127" offset="1124415">The Government is contending that the Court misconstrued the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.541" offset="1146149">To find out what that construction was, we have to look at the Court's findings and opinion and this was shown both by what is in them and what -- what is not in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.884" offset="1195468">Certain very important evidence was given the silent treatment and we think this is not unrelated to the source of the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.102" offset="1240398">And so, we believe that paternity should be established whether or not we question the legitimacy of the offspring.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.686" offset="1786671">I've already said that we are not attacking any finding on the basis that it's not supported by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.981" offset="1823869">Some findings are difficult to assess because they use such an ambiguous word as competition which may have very different meanings in its different applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.433" offset="2205675">Now, the Court's conclusion of law if you care to look at it, it can be found in page 9 of our brief, it's relatively short and I think I will read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.917" offset="2263667">This is headed conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.445" offset="2285714">The facts destroyed the charges here made.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.594" offset="2302328">There's been no monopolization or conspiracy or combination or attempt to monopolize shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.235" offset="2332839">The record reflects not the dead hands of monopoly but rapidly declining prices, expanding production, intent competitions stimulated by creative research, the development of new products and uses and other benefits of a free economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.966" offset="2415804">Du Pont nor any other company similarly situated should be punish for its success.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.463" offset="2445793">Nothing warrants intervention of this Court effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.299" offset="2461153">The complaint should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.947" offset="2475781">I find in that a good many conclusions and some rhetoric but only think overtones of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.243" offset="2532937">On appendix to du Pont's brief is instances of alleged contradiction between various statements in the Governments brief and certain findings of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.110" offset="2588421">We deal with that in our reply brief and I will just state what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.004" offset="2619977">It is that in most instances and careful examination, it would be seen that there is no actual contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.034" offset="2656131">And where there is contradiction that is with one of the conclusory findings which we are attacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.067" offset="2692180">I'd like to illustrate one of these conclusory findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.141" offset="2712555">Finding 835 at record 282, I will read it, the record establishes, this is the finding, the record establishes du Pont has not monopolized trade and commerce in cellophane or in caps and bands.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.759" offset="2798968">There's nothing there except the word “monopolized” and that, of course, is the heart of Section 2.I'll read one other finding, Finding 37, and I should say that Finding 37 is one of these conclusory findings which we do attack, it's repeated in Finding 8 in one of the conclusory findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.980" offset="2887889">This is Finding 37 at record 72, irrelevant market for determining the extent of du Pont's market control is the market for flexible packaging materials (judicial notice after examination and observation).</text>
            <text syncTime="745.636" offset="2982452">This is a compound of law effect and judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.693" offset="3002723">I just don't know in my proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.647" offset="3022576">From the time available, it's possible to state only the facts which we regard as of major importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.092" offset="3060297">The fact stated will be facts found by the District Court and in some instances, facts established by undisputed evidence but ignored in the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.222" offset="3116826">Du Pont became interested in getting into manufacture of cellophane in early 1920s after it had learned that a French company called La Cellophane had developed a successful process for making cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.540" offset="3186103">The Court found this process had been developed as the result of years in research and practical operating experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.144" offset="3228526">And the Court found that it would have taken du Pont from five to eight years to reach the same point of development and would have cost it a considerable sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.137" offset="3280457">A witness for du Pont, chemical director of its cellophane subsidiary testified that the process had at least 50 variables and that a company starting from scratch would have to test out each of these 50 variables in all their permutations and combinations which he said he wasn't a mathematician but went into the million.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.083" offset="3392261">This testimony is not mentioned in our brief, it's at record 2063.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.105" offset="3420369">I also want to emphasize that the Court found that up to time of the trial, no other -- the only other commercial process which had been developed was inferior to cellophanes in cost of manufacture and quality of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.408" offset="3509603">La Cellophane and du Pont both kept this process secret by a system of fences, plant guards and passes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.573" offset="9230211">So that the only -- only patent is used as a defense by du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.352" offset="9253407">They did have some accessory patents with the basic patent on which they relies its product patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.026" offset="9280052">Now, it resulted from research to make cellophane more resistant to moisture which was recommended by the director of the cellophane subsidiary, provided du Pont was prepared to spend up to $5000 to $10,000 before calling off the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.410" offset="9369600">The evidence does not show how much the research cost except that it shows that it's considerably under $41,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.371" offset="9409411">Moistureproof cellophane is made by taking plain cellophane, and -- the plain cellophane film and running it through a solution containing such things as resins, paraffin and more vegetable fats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.102" offset="9488405">When its -- went through this solution, there is a very thin moistureproof coating applied in each sides of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.869" offset="9519438">So you cannot make moistureproof without first making plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.577" offset="9542217">The du Pont had illegal power to exclude to manufacture plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.167" offset="9564578">That illegal power equally excluded others from making moistureproof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.228" offset="9592895">This power did not become legal because du Pont obtained a patent which gave it a secondary legal power of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.327" offset="9653290">It never had to invoke that patent because no one ever came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.385" offset="9677531">It didn't -- didn't invoke it against Sylvania but this suit was settled -- settled by an agreement under which du Pont licensed Sylvania for the life of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.213" offset="9732807">This agreement provided for a -- relatively small royalty, but if Sylvania's percentage of total production of the two companies exceeded certain stated amounts, it was an absolutely prohibitive royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.932" offset="9819638">In addition, the agreement -- the license agreement provided that each company would transfer to the other on request any future moistureproof patent which it might obtain and that such a patent would not be licensed to any third person without the consent of both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.384" offset="9909499">Now, du Pont's agreement with La Cellophane required it to exchange with all its future acquired information, apparatus and patents, so that this moistureproof patent passed to La Cellophane under this agreement, but only for use outside of du Pont's territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.862" offset="9999360">Furthermore, du Pont had entered into agreements with two subsequent licensees of La Cellophane, an English company and the German company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.209" offset="10044813">And du Pont had made agreements for exchange of present and future technology and patents with each of these companies and each provided that this all was to be used only in the respecting exclusive territories of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.810" offset="10127151">Now, I come to the question whether competition of flexible packaging materials prevented du Pont from having to not compare us to cellophane.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.919" offset="10219624">It could be put this way, can cellophane be monopolized only if the entire packaging field is monopolized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.631" offset="10254524">But the District Court's view was that there could be no monopoly control over cellophane without control over this, what it called the flexible packaging materials market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.821" offset="10299246">I want to say that there is no defined recognized market of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.715" offset="10318785">What the Court meant by this was the materials which are primarily used for prepackaging, retail packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.974" offset="10355879">In other words, it was a selected kind of market to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.183" offset="10372702">The materials which the Court designated as flexible packaging materials are cellophane, other films, certain products made of paper and aluminum foil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.164" offset="10432575">We can set aluminum foil at one side, what could be said about the paper products applied generally -- generally to it and it was competitive with cellophane anyway only for very limited uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.009" offset="10496000">The competition of the other films can also be disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.179" offset="10520660">They came into the market almost at the end of the period and covered it by the monopolization charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.011" offset="10552007">Competition which did not even exist in this period could not have precluded possession of monopoly pricing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.176" offset="10588682">In addition, the -- their sales were very small and their prices are away above the price of cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.620" offset="10626403">I will refer to what was said in a du Pont exhibit to the 1948 report of its cellophane division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.984" offset="10667886">These report sales that nonviscous films, that is those other cellophane, had been competitive with cellophane only to a very minor degree that some are used very little or not at all in packaging.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.606" offset="13354423">Now, take fresh meat in the self-service stores where it's sold by the individual units, 75% of that has been du Pont's cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.691" offset="13402697">Now, of course, there's competition in the sense that some purchasers see only a small advantage between the qualities of -- which cellophane gives and it's our cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.185" offset="13460689">But as I said, this is not competition in the basic price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.718" offset="13478870">Du Pont has had the power to fix the price of cellophane at the particular point at which sales volume, probable sales volume multiplied by a price would yield the highest profit and I submit this is the essence of monopoly pricing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.528" offset="13558073">When the product is sufficiently unique to invest consumer acceptance that cellophane has, it's inevitable that there are some uses in which it is -- stands out above all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.304" offset="13617215">Now, take the ordinary package of cigarettes with which you're all familiar, for years and years, cellophane has been practically exclusively the other wrap for cigarette packages.This trade alone runs into many millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.373" offset="13697463">Now, it sales to users like the cigarette companies, the monopolies to cellophane certainly has the monopoly pricing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.686" offset="13742707">I submit that this power does not vanish into thin air because he chooses to expand his sales into areas where there may be a relatively small margin of advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.884" offset="13799445">Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful as everyone knows to monopolize any part of the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.558" offset="13834136">Now, direct and immediate dominion over a particular product or a segment of trade which constitutes part of interstate commerce certainly -- obviously comes directly within these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.561" offset="13898188">And most of the decisions deal with Section 2, the courts have considered only whether that dominion was shown and when it was shown and held that Section 2 was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.531" offset="13950119">They have not even intimated that the indirect limitation and pricing power that may come from availability of substitutes makes the power which is exercised over the commodity itself not a monopoly power which Section 2 condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.831" offset="14067252">If this kind of indirect nebulous uncertain limitation on pricing power where a defense, Section 2 of the Act would be a dead letter because there are substitutes for every product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.482" offset="14141858">There is always this -- this kind of indirect limitation on pricing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.180" offset="14168712">The competition or availability of substitutes has been considered in a few cases, the courts have held that they should limit their attention to those which are indistinguishable or substantially indistinguishable in use value and so with substantially the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.367" offset="14257424">Now, our brief used the words substantially fungible, it's a shorthand phrase for substantially indistinguishable in use value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.716" offset="14298802">We did not mean that one product had to be precisely the same in all its physical characteristics to be indistinguishable in use value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.540" offset="14350106">Du Pont's brief suggest that our interpretation would mean that there could be monopolization of a particular make of automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.203" offset="14392738">There was this purchaser buys as what the car as a whole represents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3633.388" offset="14533486">The holding of the Court that du Pont did not have monopoly pricing power was rested solely on the ground that Section 2 does not make a legal pricing power which is limited, however, remotely by the existence of a free market in lower price substitutes of the kind which the evidence discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.260" offset="14641006">If this was a misconstruction in Section 2, the Court erred in its determination of the monopoly pricing power issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.708" offset="14686772">And if -- since possession of either monopoly pricing power or power to exclude is a monopolization which Section 2 condemns error in this determination of the monopoly pricing power required reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.227" offset="14764826">We also submit that there were errors in its determination of car to exclude each required reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.426" offset="14821669">In American Tobacco case, it was held that mere -- that the existence of power to exclude, irrespective of its exercise, its actual exercise, violates Section 2 that what is forbidden is not merely power of total exclusion but power to exclude competition to its substantial extent when it is desired to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.867" offset="14935458">The District Court did not cite the American Tobacco case in the portion of its opinion dealing with power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.956" offset="14967745">It did not cite this case anywhere else in its 65 page opinion with reference to this matter, except for its short quotation, which merely sets forth the basic proposition that -- where there is power to exclude that as a violation of Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="4240.483" offset="16961829">Monopoly rights conferred by patent are to be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.073" offset="16984189">But when they are blown up, when the immunity from the Sherman Act asserted in the name of monopoly patent rights is blown up as it has been in this case, I submit that deflation is an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.272" offset="17065064">Du Pont had to go in monopoly when this patent issued in 1929 issuing the patent did not change that going monopoly, did not loose its monopoly when it licensed Sylvania in 1933, licensing -- if anything strengthened the monopoly because it gave du Pont a veto over Sylvania's licensing any third person under -- under any later acquired Sylvania moistureproof patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.226" offset="17216888">The most that can be attributed to the monopoly rights of the patent is that it gave du Pont a secondary defense against intrusion into the part of the industry represented by moistureproof cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.072" offset="17284284">Since no one ever did intrude this secondary defense, it never came into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.355" offset="17317407">There's something out of all proportion when this patent is viewed in relation to the immunity from the Sherman Act which is claimed in its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.901" offset="17367562">On the one side, there is a patent never adjudicated as to validity, developed a trifling cost for applying a moistureproof coating to cellophane film.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.594" offset="17426286">On the other side, there's the charge of monopolizing an industry, the sales in the year the patent issued were $6 million and over $57 million from the year it expired, a charge of monopolizing before the patent issued and after it expired and the charge of monopolizing trade in plain cellophane which was never within the scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.834" offset="17531298">A brief makes the further point that the moistureproof patent was used to implement trade restraining agreements because it was brought under the agreements to allocate territories and that -- this use of the patent was not one which is related to securing pecuniary reward for the monopoly given by the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.211" offset="17640803">Another patent tainted in this way is not a defense against violation of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4436.464" offset="17745816">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.665" offset="17758563">This is a fact case, a case which we come before you on now with the concession from the Government that they do not challenge the findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.628" offset="17810495">The difficulty I had with Mr. Weston's argument was a very real difficulty and that was that he didn't present to Your Honors what this record shows in the findings of the District Court were the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.828" offset="17871308">It is very easy to develop a theory of monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.373" offset="17897430">I supposed in any industry, if one can select a fact here, a half fact there, a quarter truth here and put them together with theory and surmise but we litigated these issues in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.069" offset="17968274">These arguments were made advance and pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.536" offset="17986142">There were witnesses who appeared and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.986" offset="17999935">There were many, many documents read, studied and analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.473" offset="18017802">The Court went out into the field and looked at these products being sold, examined how they were made and saw the actual operations of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.275" offset="18061061">And we had buyers and we had sellers who came and said that this is not the way the industry works, that is -- where the Government says it is, but it worked in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.525" offset="18114038">So, that my theme here is talk to the Court today about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.915" offset="18143608">And my argument is that when the facts of this industry are understood, you come and are compelled to the conclusion that this complaint was properly dismissed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.634" offset="18198465">And I intend in every way I know how to bring before Your Honors what is in this eight volumes which is only a portion of the record below and which it took weeks and weeks and days of trial to develop with examination and cross-examination of witnesses, discovery, discussion of individual documents and bring it to you in terms of these findings which aren't challenged to show you what this true industry position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.979" offset="18315912">Out in the first place, let's look at what we were charged with because that's what we litigate, we had a complaint and we tried it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.234" offset="18356872">If Your Honors will turn to page 6 of Volume I where the complaint is found, you'll see a recital there of the offenses charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.485" offset="18409848">Now, this, I say to you, is the starting point for this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.439" offset="18445688">The Government concedes there was no conspiracy to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.562" offset="18466168">The Government concedes there is no attempt to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.579" offset="18486230">The Government concedes there is no monopolization as to caps and bands, another issue in this case that we've litigated, and the Government has dropped all of paragraph 22 (e) with respect to restraints on the distribution side of this case as to which there are many unchallenged findings and the record isn't even here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.130" offset="18584451">So we are in this Court now with a very specific single charge, that is the charge of monopoly power, the charge of market control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.603" offset="18650384">You will see in 22 (a) the definition of the power over price which was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.787" offset="18679118">It was alleged that we had a power to fix and then train arbitrary noncompetitive prices in terms of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.033" offset="18716108">And that was what we litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.164" offset="18724571">And you will see in (b) and (c) power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.353" offset="18745365">And it is said on the top of page 7 that these powers have become self-sustaining and self-perpetuating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.842" offset="18791340">Now, the Court understands, I hope, that there are no agreements here that are attacked to be stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.640" offset="18814537">There is no practice in terms of any trade or commerce or conduct which is attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.787" offset="18839092">We are there with that position and this case is a challenge to that position on the ground that it gives us as of the date of the complaint, 1947, power over price and power to exclude and those are the issues --</text>

            <text syncTime="4885.994" offset="19543876">But starting first with our position, which is the question of attack, I submit that that is a question of fact which has to be determined by normal fact finding processes and that these issues of power cannot be speculated about but they must be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.867" offset="19635409">The fact that we have 68% of the cellophane business or 75% depending on whether you look at it in 1947 or the time of the decision is no QED.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.857" offset="19683370">You don't just automatically say that somebody has 75% of a product, that they the power to exclude and power over price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.283" offset="19717120">The teachings of this Court in every decision on this subject have -- have spoken continually of the need of analysis of the market setting, of the patents of phrase that are followed in practice, of the buyers habits, of what takes place in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.482" offset="19801861">And we must look to those things to determine the significance of the percentage or, if you will, to determined the significance of any other single fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.895" offset="19847523">Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that we recognize and we state to the Court that cellophane is a product capable of being monopolized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.813" offset="19911158">We are not saying that you have to show a monopoly over flexible fact, the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.706" offset="19938743">We say that cellophane is -- is the product we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.247" offset="19960895">It is made in substantial volumes and the question presented is whether we have these powers as to cellophane not whether we have these powers over flexible packaging materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.015" offset="20015961">And that's the way the court below approached the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.976" offset="20031843">And he determined, we did not have these powers over cellophane, either is the price or as to power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.054" offset="20076147">And in determining the issue of price, he looked not only to cellophane, its manufacture and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.170" offset="20112614">When he looked to the market setting to the conditions under which it is sold, to the competitive influences in the market to determine whether those were such as to deprive the part of the power to price of cellophane in the manner which we were charged of being able to do in the complaint, arbitrarily to set predetermined rates of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.078" offset="20216268">We have a very unusual case here on power to price -- over price which is the first thing I want to discuss because we are not before this Court with any charge of the predatory use of this price and power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.891" offset="20295471">Every case that I know of in this field has involved -- that has involved the power over price has been a case where there has been a predatory use of that frequently coupled with exclusion.</text>
