            <label>Mr. Walter K. Sibbald</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">And the moment of starting for the recess, I was referring to Mr. Ward's in connection with the filing of this master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.860" offset="51409">On page 11 of the respondent's brief, I have quoted from his testimony when he appeared as a witness in this case and I asked him if he had anything to do with the preparation of the master's report in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.002" offset="128000">And he answered, “Oh, definitely, yes, sure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="37.469" offset="149838">Then I asked him whether he took any part in the preparation of that report and his answer was, “I do not recall whether I did or not”.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.600" offset="194351">Then, I called his attention to a sentence at the end of that report, a special master's fee in this cause is settled by an agreement between counsel for plaintiff and your master.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.624" offset="250462">And when I asked him when he had that agreement after being evasive for at least one answer, he finally said, “I imagined it was about the time he was ready to file the report.”</text>
            <text syncTime="77.097" offset="308349">And when I asked him how much he paid the master under this private agreement, he said, “It was either $200 or $250.”</text>
            <text syncTime="86.442" offset="345757">And the record shows that customarily in Florida, master commissioner in uncontested divorce action are paid under the order of the Court, a fee of $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.512" offset="417959">Now, I say that it is a matter of serious concern where we are in considering the full faith and credit or due process of law that are involved in this Florida decree, whether a report filed by the master upon which the Court makes its order under those circumstances is due process of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter K. Sibbald</label>
            <text syncTime="138.672" offset="554632">In Florida, I copied the statute, where there's no -- no arrangement made for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.706" offset="574798">It shall be fixed by an order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.613" offset="586397">That's the statute that I copied into my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.355" offset="601339">So, I -- I say to Your Honors that I -- I still -- still seriously appeal that this entire decree, this entire proceeding in Florida was not entitled to full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.406" offset="649613">But whether that be true or not, it wasn't in this case until after the question as to whether it was, was not in this case in the trial court and was not considered either as a matter of the pleadings or in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.645" offset="722547">Now, counsel for Mr. Armstrong here in his replied brief says that, when I quote the brief filed on behalf of Mr. Armstrong and the trial court wherein they admit it that they were just two questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.563" offset="786181">First, whether the Court could grant a divorce and secondly, whether it could make a division of property, where they agreed with me that those were the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.047" offset="824111">Mr. -- or Judge Gorman in his brief says, “Oh, I just took a sentence out of context.”</text>
            <text syncTime="211.425" offset="845636">Now, in order that there'll be -- be no question about that as to whether that was the matter -- the means upon which this case was tried in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.620" offset="882416">I have had printed and have left with the clerk the required number of copies of the brief filed on behalf of Armstrong in the trial court wherein it was agreed by all concerned that there were two questions before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.821" offset="975203">First, whether the Court could grant a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.486" offset="985861">Secondly, whether the Court could make a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.625" offset="1002475">And I'm asking (Inaudible) now to have that copy of the brief filed here as a supplement to my brief rather than have it appear in this record that I haven't stated it by just pulling a sentence out of context.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.729" offset="1274880">But if Thompson versus Thompson were the basis of his claim, then I -- I suggest to the Court that there isn't anything that this Court has said in either of the two Williams cases or in any of the other cases that have come up here involving the subject of divisible divorce or ex parte divorce that would warrant this Court in holding that a decree such as was entered in Thompson versus Thompson by the Virginia court is entitled to full faith and credit because of the reasons that you have given full faith and credit to the ex parte divorce decrees that have been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.718" offset="1490860">You said that as a matter of practicality, making due process of law and full faith and credit coincide as it where in order to protect innocent persons and legitimacy of children that divorce decrees must be given faith and credit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert N. Gorman</label>
            <text syncTime="415.314" offset="1661179">There have been many questions it seems to me that -- or aside from the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.193" offset="1684689">Now, I want to say right at the outset and I have the greatest respect for my former colleague, Judge Zimmerman, who wrote the opinion in the Supreme Court Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.130" offset="1720424">But very frankly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals is a much more exhaustive opinion and it shows that practically every one of these questions that was here were determined by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.540" offset="1774132">They were not any last minutes suggestions and the opinion of the Court of Appeals is on 11 (a) to 24 (a) of the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.406" offset="1817600">For example, on 17 (a), it shows that Mr. Sibbald did raise the question that the divorce was fraudulent and the Court of Appeals there found there was no fraud and therefore, we don't have to pay any attention to that stuff about master commissioner's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.069" offset="1900251">And the Court of Appeals says, it should be noted that the trial court made no express finding that the Florida decree had been obtained through fraud and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.246" offset="1944973">And then there is another proposition in the opinion on 14 (a), it went into length about hitting people and knocking their teeth out, all of those matters were disputed, that letter was very greatly disputed because most of it was in her own handwriting and Armstrong said he didn't know what he was signing.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.073" offset="2032222">He knew what he wrote out but what she wrote out, he didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.691" offset="2046746">But all we have to do is to look at 14 (a) of the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.654" offset="2074540">There it says in the last paragraph, at the trial of these issues evidence was introduced from which the conclusion could be reasonably deduced that the plaintiff in this action, that's Mrs.Armstrong, had been guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty and that the Florida decree granting a divorce to defendant herein was supported by sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.627" offset="2194495">Well, if that is true what our claim is and if those were the facts, Ohio could not act as a court of review on that Florida decree because if those facts are true, they have once adjudicated and they had said, as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, they had denied alimony, which is on page 249 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.540" offset="2302119">Now, I want to say before coming to one of the most important points that this issue has been in the case from the very outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.784" offset="2343079">All you have to do is to look at page 2 and 3 of Mr. Sibbald's brief, where he brings up the question that the Florida decree was obtained by fraud, then you go to page 7 of the record whereas defendant denies that plaintiff was not served with summons and set action pending in the Dade County Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.597" offset="2426358">It said defendant have been duly and legally served with summons and set action.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.617" offset="2446420">According to the law of State of Florida and that by reason thereof said court had full and complete jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over the persons of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.711" offset="2498769">I don't know how more clearly you can raise an issue of res judicata than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.725" offset="2518831">But if there was any doubt if you will turn to page 11, which Mr. Sibbald did not read, for further answer, defendant denies each and every allegation in plaintiff's amended petition contained, not herein specifically admitted to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.033" offset="2584033">And further says that by reason, the allegations aforesaid, plaintiffs is -- plaintiff is not entitled to a divorce or alimony from defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.475" offset="2629799">Within there very clearly, so the issue has been here all the time, both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals recognized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.590" offset="2666266">And I might say, by the way, that there is no question raised either by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court that this was a division of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.148" offset="2712555">There are two things that are clear in both opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.575" offset="2730214">One is that the matrimonial domicile, they say, was in fraud and there's no evidence to the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.837" offset="2767308">And secondly, they recognized the Florida decree as one, not going into a division to property but denying alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.844" offset="2807327">If you will turn to 25 (a), here is what the Supreme Court says in the syllabus --</text>

            <text syncTime="713.138" offset="2852467">And I think we've had an argument before here over what the syllabus in Ohio means in a former case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.846" offset="2883291">Paragraph 2 of the syllabus, 25 (a), such a divorce decrees in favor husband based on service by publication on the wife residing in another State does not as to a denial of alimony therein operate extraterritorially and he's not entitled to full faith and credit section in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.468" offset="2973780">If we go over to page 28, but may a divorce secured by a husband even in the so-called matrimonial domicile were service of summons on the wife then residing another State has been by publication only denied a wife any right to alimony not division of property, so that such denial must be recognized this conclusive in another jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.488" offset="3065940">They say we think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.506" offset="3073985">But on those two points, matrimonial domicile and on the question of this being whether it's alimony or whether it's a division of property, there was no dispute whatsoever in the lower courts and if we take the decree on page 248 of the record --</text>
