            <text syncTime="15.486" offset="61858">It is the position of the respondents in this case, first, that Congress has consented to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.100" offset="100310">And that in so doing, Congress has waived any immunity that might result from exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.544" offset="138136">Secondly, this tax was not imposed upon any property or interest in property of the United States, and only the property of the Offutt Housing Company, the petitioner has been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.077" offset="204278">Now we rely upon a flat consent by Congress to this taxation in the -- the legislation under which this project was constructed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dixon G. Adams</label>
            <text syncTime="100.101" offset="400300">Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.637" offset="414511">Now the lease recites as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.667" offset="430602">Witnesses, that under the authority of the Act of August 5th, 1947, 10 U.S.C. 1270 and the Act of August 8, 1949 Public Law 211 81st Congress, and goes on to lease 63 acres of bare land to the petitioner here for a consideration of $100 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.601" offset="550348">Now the Wherry Act was not a leasing act.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.602" offset="570305">It was an amendment to the National Housing Act and it extended the provisions of the National Housing Act to this type of rental housing, but it gave no new authority to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.140" offset="628506">The Congress looked to its prior authority which was contained in the Act of August 5th, 1947, which is set out on this first section which is set out on page 22 of the appendix in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.875" offset="699455">This was a general Military Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.135" offset="720457">Now the leases made under the authority of the 1947 Act were generally limited to a term of five years, and they were also cancelable in the event of a national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.051" offset="788167">And this, of course, would not work under the Wherry Act because it made profits impelled profits and made financing very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.092" offset="832366">So these provisions, these limitations were removed in the Wherry Act in Section 805 of the Wherry Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.653" offset="874580">But the Wherry Act itself in Section 805 which is setout at page 26 in the appendix to our brief recites, 'Whenever the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force determines that it is desirable to lease property within the meaning of the Act of August 5th, 1947 to effectuate the purposes of this title, the Secretary concerned is authorized to lease such property under the authority of said Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.907" offset="1011566">And that goes on to say that the two limitations as to duration and as to cancellation in the event of a national emergency should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.597" offset="1058377">The rest of the Act of August 5th, 1947 was not disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.204" offset="1092754">And it is our contention that Section 6 was incorporated and that the consent of taxation applies to this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.008" offset="1136013">Now this consent was the basis for decision in all of the cases decided by appellate courts both state and federal, which have passed upon the consent proposition in Wherry Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.029" offset="1220023">The first such case was Meade Heights, Incorporated, versus State Tax Commission of Maryland decided by the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.984" offset="1267879">There as here, the United States had exclusive jurisdiction over the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.541" offset="1302152">The distinction in the Maryland case, Meade Heights case, was that the least involved purported or vested title in the lessee title to the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.685" offset="1362651">Here, the lease purports to vest title to the improvements of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.804" offset="5651122">Now we don't say that that is a direct consent but we do say that the inclusion of this section by Congress would appear to evidence and intent or an indication that Congress intended that this property should be treated the same as any other property insured by on which the Federal Housing Commission insured the mortgage, it shouldn't be put on any other basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.238" offset="5852891">Now the District Court in New Jersey decided the case for the demurral there the municipality under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.820" offset="5899180">And the District Court there said that, certainly, a private corporation like the petitioner shouldn't be preferred to the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.567" offset="5938260">But we don't say that this is a direct consent of taxation, but we say it's an implied consent to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.099" offset="5988310">Now, in the third way, we say there's consent by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.280" offset="6033032">This is a lease for 75 years to a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.670" offset="6062602">And it was authorized by Congress and Congress in Section 805 of the Wherry Act set no term, no length of time on this lease, presumably this could be a lease for 150 or 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.705" offset="6142746">That the same section also gave the secretaries power to sell the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.454" offset="6169809">And we believe that such a statute as that impliedly waves exclusive jurisdiction and impliedly consents to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.721" offset="6214844">And as authority for that, we've cited the case of S.R.A. versus Minnesota decided by this Court which involved property over which the United States had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.277" offset="6273045">It was sold as authorized by Congress under an executory contract of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.029" offset="6304078">A legal title remaining in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.731" offset="6318916">And the S.R.A. Incorporated there contended that there had been no waiver of exclusive jurisdiction and you couldn't tax anything over which the United States had exclusive jurisdiction, but the Court there announced what it called the rule of necessity and said that certainly the unrestricted transfer of this property waived any -- any such claim that the United States still had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.522" offset="6442005">And we believe that a -- a lease of this type for 75 years to a private profit seeking corporation brings at somewhere close to the rule of this Court as announced in S.R.A. against Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.901" offset="6775536">The petitioner suggests in its brief that -- that the army used the old form and the Air Force didn't but the Moses Lake case indicates that the Air Force did the same thing when they first started making leases under the Wherry Act, they vested title to the improvements in the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.413" offset="6849620">And when it appeared that these units were going to be assessed, they changed the form of the lease and read -- in Moses Lake they actually presume to modify the lease retroactively to vest title to the improvements of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.757" offset="6934988">And that, first of all, it was never the intention of Congress that title to this building should be in the United States and any reading of the debates in Congress for instance our brief at page 16 will indicate that Congress understood that title to these things as to be on the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.368" offset="7025371">Mr. Manoli said it's a strictly private enterprise building which probably construction is moved out and the whole matter is turned over to private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.076" offset="7076258">And Mr. Johnson said, I'm reading down toward the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.295" offset="7101127">In other words we propose to have contractors build houses on military installations and pay the rental allowance provided by law for service personnel in form of rent to the contractor so that in 30 years, the house will be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.092" offset="7168313">When the installments have been paid out to the contractors, the house and land become the property of the Government not before but after and other indications in the debates in the committee are the same.</text>
