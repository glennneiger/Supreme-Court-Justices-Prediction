            <text syncTime="38.704" offset="154749">This case arises under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 more frequently referred to as the Wage and Hour Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.783" offset="215040">The particular question involves the interpretation of an amendment to the Wage and Hour Act passed in 1947, known as the Portal-to-Portal Amendment to the Wage and Hour Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.615" offset="294452">And the question presented involved in the case and under the facts of the case involves the interpretation of Section 4, subsections (1) (2) of the Act in question and stated in the terms of the cases et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.413" offset="385567">The question is, whether or not, under the Portal-to-Portal Act, the amendment, the time used by the petitioner's employees had its battery manufacturing claim in changing their street clothes into work clothes before punching at the clock at 7:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.755" offset="470936">And the time after they had finished their day's work and punched out the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.502" offset="505940">And then went back and removed their clothes in which they were working and took shower baths.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.441" offset="533734">About 30 minutes a day, 10 minutes in the first operation and about 20 minutes in the other, whether or not, that is compensable time.Under the amendment of 1947, the language of which generally speaking provided that -- that it there should not be included in compensable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.720" offset="670824">The time spent in certain 'preliminary' and 'postliminary' activities before going to work and after coming from the work, in the absence of a custom or a practice at the petitioners' establishment or any absence of a written contract making those particular activities compensatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.782" offset="799033">On each day, there's about 10 minutes at the beginning and change when the employee comes in and takes off their clothes and puts on some work clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.186" offset="844696">That's about 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.261" offset="852950">That's about 20 minutes when he gets off and finishes his work manufacturing the batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.583" offset="882312">And goes in and removes the work clothing and takes a shower bath and gets his street clothing out of his locker and go and -- and leaves the premise, about 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.714" offset="926824">The case, if the Court please, arose by the Secretary of Labor filing a suit in the Federal District Court at Nashville, seeking an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.460" offset="981786">Because, under the admitted facts of this case, there was no record kept of that particular time of changing clothes or taking a shower bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.667" offset="1022642">Nor was there any effort to compensate for that time that was consumed on the premises by the petitioners' employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.664" offset="1150642">In other words, whether you could make batteries in your street clothes and leave without taking a shower bath.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.320" offset="1205185">That it was medically advisable for the employee to change clothes and not work in his street clothes for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.830" offset="1251265">In the first place, there were acids used in the manufacture of batteries which could have destroyed it and he had a question of economy or which might have been to some extent injurious to his health if he continued to wear the same clothes on which he got acids.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.975" offset="1379892">Perhaps, I'd better get right to the stipulation that includes the basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.540" offset="1406119">As a matter of fact, the petitioner has two businesses and next door to this battery manufacturing plant, the petitioner owns a salvage business and runs a laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.035" offset="1452095">And the petitioner permitted the employees to use old clothes that he had acquired in the salvage business which had been laundered free rather than using their street clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.115" offset="1508415">And they -- no charge was made for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.701" offset="1650730">We differ only as to what should be the conclusion drawn from the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.864" offset="1675389">And that's a question the Court will have to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.762" offset="1690958">It is stipulated and Your Honors we'll find it on -- in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.143" offset="1716558">Defendants, that's the petitioner here, have never issued any order nor do they make any requirement requiring their plant employees to use the clothes-changing and showering facilities which they make available.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.382" offset="1781447">That answers, I believe, one of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.543" offset="1794090">Most of the employees do regularly change from their street clothes to work clothes before reporting to their work in the morning and most of them do, regular, take a shower in defendant's shower room and change back into the street clothing after leaving their working places in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.576" offset="1878204">That has reference to the fact it was part of the work where they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.967" offset="1895863">Now, the stipulations also provides, however, some employees do not follow this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.738" offset="1930867">And it stipulated these defendants make no requirement of any kind as to the type of clothes, and which are to be worn by their employees during work hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.356" offset="1985411">And the clothes or type of clothes which are worn by the employees is entirely optional with the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.137" offset="2024490">Now, the most and perhaps the most important part of the entire stipulation is the sentence that I will read next.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.385" offset="2057509">In those instances where special equipment is required such as respirators, gloves, and so forth, defendants employees are paid for the time taken in putting on such special equipment and in removing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.882" offset="2135458">This, however, is done during the work shift and as a practical matter involves very little time.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.926" offset="3467703">Because after all, what we are concerned is, is what is law.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.442" offset="3489750">And not what the law should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.419" offset="3497587">Not whether it would be reasonable to make a distinction as a legislative matter, but whether or not, Congress has made that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.111" offset="3532382">So, I will come quickly to the language about which we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.253" offset="3568953">The Portal-to-Portal Amendment, which was passed in 1947, provides, explicitly, and it's in the appendix of our brief, at pages 84 and 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.288" offset="3633110">And that's what I'm reading from at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.406" offset="3649620">That provides explicitly that except for certain exceptions, not important here, "no employee shall be subjected to any liability, on account of the failure of an employer, to pay the employee wages or to keep records."</text>
            <text syncTime="935.961" offset="3743765">And now I'm quoting, "for or on account of any of the following activities of such employee engaged in on or after the effective date of this Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="947.743" offset="3790890">Now, what are those activities for which or any of which we are not to be liable?</text>
            <text syncTime="955.037" offset="3820147">First, walking, riding or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.205" offset="3888797">And second, activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to, said principle activity or activities which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases such principal activity or activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.248" offset="4000914">Now, that's in the absence of an express contract to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.213" offset="4016797">And there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.937" offset="4023693">We have no such contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.696" offset="4030694">And it's in the absence of any custom or practice and there is no such custom or practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.291" offset="4057130">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held against us and the exact basis of the adverse decision by the Court of Appeals is expressed in one sentence as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.752" offset="4122958">The changing of clothes and taking of shower baths at that time and in the manner herein described are regular practices which are recognized as essential safeguards against the serious occupational hazards to which appellants employees are daily subjected in the performance of their duties, is sufficient to render them an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities which they are employed to perform, within the meaning of the Portal-to-Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.076" offset="4252212">And time spent in such activities is time worked within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.492" offset="4281887">Now, that is specifically what we disagree with in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.687" offset="4302681">And our insistence, if the Court please, specifically in the language of the admitted and conceded facts of the case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.712" offset="4346776">There are two types of activity which an employee engages in under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.466" offset="4373838">They're both related, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.086" offset="4384287">The one's connected with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.386" offset="4397453">The first is the principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.543" offset="4406126">And that's the work for which the employee was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.396" offset="4421486">That's when he begins whatever his part in the actual manufacturing process is, the manufacturing of batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.505" offset="4457953">That's between 7:30 in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.081" offset="4480313">Now, it is our insistence that changing your clothes, in order to engage in the principal activity, is clearly under the language of the Portal-to-Portal Act, a preliminary activity, and removing work clothes and taking a shower bath, after you have finished your principal activity of manufacturing batteries is clearly a postliminary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.549" offset="4594103">And it doesn't make any difference in the essential character of that particular act, as between whether there's a principal activity or preliminary or postliminary activity, whether you are induced to engage in that ancillary act for hygiene reasons -- hygienic reasons or for health reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.080" offset="4688248">And that's the reason I answered the Chief Justice a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.156" offset="4704549">That while it is true, that here, we have a health case, nevertheless, the reason for it, about which there's no dispute, does not rub it of its essential character of being postliminary and preliminary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.321" offset="4877270">We don't contend that there can't be a case when the activity itself is -- is called in -- in terms that are not applicable to the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.240" offset="4920947">But here we have a bonafide, thet everyday act of changing in work clothes and everyday act of taking a bath after they get through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.736" offset="4954906">And they concede in their brief that if a man is washing to get off grease, washing to get off dirt, is preliminary and postliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.771" offset="4999001">But if he's doing it to get off particles of lead which might sometimes infect him, then it has a different connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.020" offset="5040065">And, of course, we say that that's a different motive, a proper motive but it's the same act and certainly, if the Court please, taking a bath does not become a part of the principal activity of manufacturing batteries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.571" offset="5170260">What is the simple meaning of the words "preliminary" and "postliminary"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.324" offset="5193247">And since my time is slipping away, Your Honor, of course, knows that this Portal-to-Portal Act was passed following three decisions of this Court, Tennessee Coal against Muscoda in 321.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.556" offset="5270152">Jewell Ridge against the Local in 325 and Anderson against Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.239" offset="5296901">Now in -- in -- this Court decided those three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.860" offset="5311425">And they involved taking shower baths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.097" offset="5324382">And they involved changing clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.862" offset="5335353">And in -- in a number of instances, there was direct involved taking shower baths as a health regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.268" offset="5365029">And this Court held that they were compensable apart of the -- by Mr. Justice Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.100" offset="5388330">Thereupon Congress said, we're going to remedy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.842" offset="5399301">We don't change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.292" offset="5405153">And they passed what is called the Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.992" offset="5415915">So, we find that Congress in its declaration of its purpose, its -- its findings and declaration of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.761" offset="5467011">And we've set it out in our brief and I won't take the time to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.866" offset="5483416">We've set it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.339" offset="5489267">They said that the purpose is to make these acts that the Court has just declared in these cases as a part of the work day to exclude them from the work day unless they are included by the custom of the -- of -- of the business or the trade itself are brought in under a collective-bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.354" offset="5581322">We have two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.275" offset="5589055">One very famous case that was pending when Congress passed the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.715" offset="5606818">It's a District Court case and it was amended so as to bring in the question of the scope of this -- this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.311" offset="5641195">It's the case of Swanson, McComb against Swanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.091" offset="5660317">And I can't emphasize, too much, that it states our position exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.617" offset="5678393">It was a District Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.417" offset="5685603">It's reported in 77 federal, rose in Omaha, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.079" offset="5704307">And there, if the Court please, people were engaged in the preparation of food for human consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.525" offset="5730011">And we had a federal -- and we had a state law that made it mandatory that they wear certain types of white uniforms made out of a certain material that was washed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.678" offset="5782674">Now, that wasn't to protect the health of the employee but it was to prevent the food from being contaminated which is a half step closer to the actual principal activity for which a man was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.411" offset="5845577">And they were furnished and the wearing of the uniforms were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.790" offset="5867102">And there was a federal inspector that would not let them go to work until he inspected them to see they had that on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.988" offset="5895941">The question came up just as it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.216" offset="5912764">And at the expense of using a little time because this is the position on which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.783" offset="5943066">The District Judge held in that case, no appeal was taken, and that case remained the law until this case as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.116" offset="5988415">Now, defining antecedent.Now, the defining antecedent of the phrase said the Court, Judge Delehant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.137" offset="6032509">The defining antecedent of the phrase “principal activity” or activities is Section 254 (a) (2) -- in Section 254 (a) (2) appears in 254 (a) (1), in the language, quoting from the statute, "The principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform."</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.734" offset="6118922">Those words are not abstruse, obscure, or uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.686" offset="6142642">They refer to the productive work in behalf of the employer which he has or working to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.443" offset="6169704">That's the principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.866" offset="6179422">For the machinist, it is the work that has been so laid, for the store clerk, the sale of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.685" offset="6210664">For the carpenter, to labor in the erection or repair of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.011" offset="6231980">And as we say, for the battery manufacturer, the manufacture of batteries for automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.577" offset="6266253">Now, when the Court in the Swanson case came to what is meant by 'postliminary' and "preliminary' they said, the Court said this, "preliminary" and "postliminary" are not words of dubious or recondite, or confusing significance even if the latter is not frequently employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.928" offset="6343680">And there they held that even though the putting on of certain uniform was required under the federal inspection, even though they had the direct relationship of preventing contamination of the food that they were going to manufacture, they were nevertheless, were not principal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.051" offset="6412121">The Congress, had legislated on the basis of principal activities and postliminary and preliminary activities without making any distinction of why a man took a bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.442" offset="6477740">Whether it was for reasons of health or whether it was merely to get cleaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.723" offset="6494877">Now, just a few months ago, the Eighth Circuit had the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.829" offset="6515252">(Inaudible) case, that's the best I can do on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.752" offset="6546913">Decided April 29th, 1955 by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.592" offset="6566348">And they had exactly the same question because there, the men were working in a powder plant and they got these nitroglycerin and powder and things like that all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.196" offset="6616712">And there, they were required by the -- by the operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.967" offset="6635833">Both as a matter of safety and as a matter of health to change their clothes and take a bath, exactly the same situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.030" offset="6676062">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit pointed out and I'm quoting, “They were required to take a shower as a safety measure for the employee's own health, to avoid after effects of powder remaining on the person of the employee."</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.502" offset="6745966">Now here's what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.995" offset="6751922">They said, “We're not concerned with the reason that impels a man to take a bath, nor was Congress concerned."</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.475" offset="6781806">They said if it's postliminary or preliminary, of course, it has to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.051" offset="6800196">A man wouldn't do something that had no relationship to -- to his work normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.939" offset="6819736">But the Eighth Circuit said this, "If the time principal activity was intended to include ipso facto activities -- activity necessarily incident to the principal activity, there would be no possibility of applying the 1949 amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the application of Section 254 (a) (1) prohibiting the inclusion of necessarily preliminary and postliminary activities in compensable time for principal activities unless so recognized by contract, a custom would likewise be circumscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.817" offset="6979187">And the Court concluded in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.621" offset="6990472">We must conclude that the necessity of an activity to the performance of the principal activity will not alone make the former a part of principal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.107" offset="7040418">So we say, in the first instance, if the Court please.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.936" offset="7819703">Since this case and the case, to be obvious, following this Mitchell versus King Packing, raised the same legal questions, it may be helpful if I take the time to show just what the legal position of the Government is in both of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.078" offset="7896294">And to point out -- to point out the basic difference in the legal approach between the Sixth Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit in the King Packing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.419" offset="7945613">Our position is that Section 4 of the Portal Act, which counsel, Mr. Sims, has read you, although, I don't think he emphasized the key words, "principal activities" to the extent that we feel is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.870" offset="8007471">And that is the Section which is at issue in this case is , is markedly different from Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.339" offset="8037355">Now, there has been a tendency in the Court to confuse these two Sections and not to recognize the marked difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.570" offset="8070269">It has worked both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.255" offset="8076957">Some of the courts have gone so far as to hold principal activities is covered under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.268" offset="8100989">And we don't contend that principal activities, which we define and we think the legislative history supports us as activities which are an integral part of and indispensable to the employee's job, whether performed during the scheduled workday or before or after the scheduled workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.725" offset="8198896">There was principal activities under Section 4 were preserved by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.978" offset="8219899">And Congress was very careful, although, I gave a very drastic remedy for existing claims at the time it enacted -- enacted the Portal Act, because of the -- of the flood of litigation that developed following the Mt. Clemens case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.208" offset="8296803">Congress did because of it, what it deemed an emergency, gave a drastic remedy and made non-compensable all claims prior to the enactment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.927" offset="8355631">It was very careful, however, in drawing Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.981" offset="8371827">And that Section went through several drafts.It was formulated in the Senate and went through several versions in the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.096" offset="8832313">The Ninth Circuit took the position that no matter how necessary, how indispensable or how integral a part of the principal activity, the knife sharpening time it was in that case was the fact that it was performed outside or before or after the scheduled work shift on the production line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.714" offset="12874815">And that by the way, that interpretation was before Congress in -- when it enacted the 1949 amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.449" offset="13381695">Senator McGrath specifically asked, inquired to Senator Cooper about the workers in chemical plants who are required to put on special clothing and take off their clothing at the end of the workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.692" offset="13442717">And in some plants, they are required to take shower baths before they leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.408" offset="13461629">And Senator Cooper answered that in no uncertain terms.He said he was glad the Senator had raised that question because I believe it gives us the opportunity of drawing a fine distinction between the type of the activity which we consider compensable and the type which should not be compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.453" offset="13537802">Then he -- in accordance with our intention as to the definition of principal activity if the employer -- employee could not perform his activity without putting on certain clothes then the time used in changing into these clothes would be compensable as part of his principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.088" offset="13600287">On the other hand, if changing clothes were merely a convenience to the employee and not directly related to a specific work, it would not be considered a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.902" offset="13635605">Now, this does not, of course, precisely describe the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.439" offset="13653682">But the situation we have in -- in this chemical plant is, if anything, more an integral part, makes the showering and the bathing more of an integral part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.478" offset="13693910">And I would like to just call attention to two facts regarding that -- this battery, wet storage battery industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.509" offset="13722018">The number one cause of occupational disease is in this country, and this was undisputed testimony in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.638" offset="13746469">The number one cause of occupational disease is lead poisoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.568" offset="13766217">And the number one industry that is the source of lead poisoning, is the wet storage battery industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.633" offset="13794429">So, that it has become and it is generally agreed by industrial and medical experts that careful washing, changing of clothes, so that the employee doesn't use the same clothes when he leaves the plant, changing of clothes and a thorough washing of the lead and acid off of his body, mostly it's the lead, because it's only, the lead are vapors and the fumes and the dust, molten lead is the -- is the most hazardous sort of lead poisoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.779" offset="13927027">The company's own doctor testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.972" offset="13939879">That it's because of its dust that gets under fingernails and into the hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.524" offset="13970077">A very careful bathing is required after the day's work is over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.134" offset="14368496">They defended in a -- in a suit for damages on the grounds that the employee was -- was guilty of contributory negligence in not following instructions to bathe carefully.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.411" offset="14485629">Now, they have put in ventilating equipment and all other kinds of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.565" offset="14502243">This is much less expensive than the equipment they put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.497" offset="14517917">And that's why they require the bathing because this is a sure and easy and inexpensive way of meeting those hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.967" offset="14551771">But it's just as much related to the hazard as if for ventilating system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.332" offset="14569326">It's just as much of a legitimate an item of cost as of the ventilating system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.923" offset="14615615">That -- they -- it's true that one employee, I think it -- there was a single employee who said he didn't use the -- the shower because he had a wounded foot and he was afraid of an infection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.044" offset="14664098">And he lived very near by and so he took that risk and went nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.627" offset="14682488">But the undisputed and medical testimony is that that was not a desirable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.279" offset="14709029">And that they -- it shouldn't really be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.960" offset="14719791">And here -- he apparently felt, and one of the reasons stated -- say there's no formal requirement here, that it's -- not even to discipline the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.553" offset="14754168">You can't force them to take a bath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.147" offset="14764513">You certainly can encourage them to -- encourage them to by -- by letting to do it on the company terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.300" offset="14789172">And it certainly, there's enough evidence in this record to show that in this circumstance, this is the -- a -- a particularly strong circumstance where everything should be done to encourage them to take the -- the shower and to change their clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.212" offset="14856777">I might call the Court's attention to the findings of fact on the requirement, if time permits, to read just the Court of Appeals' opinion on 221 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.898" offset="14959491">The Court, despite of the -- the fact that there was no formal requirement, the Court said that the general requirement of bathing and clothes changing in storage battery plant is not prompted by mere desire for cleanliness or personal hygiene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.036" offset="15036082">In other words, it's not merely for the convenience of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.634" offset="15050501">Those considerations apply to all industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.697" offset="15062727">And time spent for such reasons is generally considered preliminary and postliminary to actual working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.493" offset="15085923">But the changing and bathing required of employees in a storage battery factory is occasioned by the poisonous substances used in the manufacturing process.</text>
