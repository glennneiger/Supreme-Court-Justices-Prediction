            <label>Mr. Harry D. Graham</label>
            <text syncTime="36.181" offset="144718">Now, this is an admiralty action involving some 350 odd passengers who, back in 1947, prepaid passage fares for voyages on board a Honduran flagship known as the City of Athens, to various ports in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.578" offset="242312">They had prepaid their fares for someone as prior to July of 1947 and the voyage as to which they had prepaid their fares were to commence with the voyage on July the 17th and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.486" offset="309917">The respondent, on the appointed date, did not provide the vessel to carry these passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.552" offset="350145">The vessel having been liable by a statutory creditor or lienor, and he was, therefore -- he therefore default and then providing the transportation for these passengers, and these passengers sued in admiralty for the recovery of the prepaid fares which they had paid, which they received no transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.389" offset="445544">They received the decree in the District Court through Southern District of New York and they extended their respective fares which they paid and the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court holding that the jurisdiction of the causes of action for these passengers was not within admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.371" offset="525479">And because (Inaudible) comes to this Court on writ -- writ of certiorari granted on October the 24th, 1955, the questions involved are whether admiralty has jurisdiction of action seeking recovery of prepaid passage moneys paid as consideration on the maritime contracts of transportation?</text>
            <text syncTime="154.809" offset="619207">Which maritime contracts have breached by nonperformance?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.707" offset="634776">The second question is whether the jurisdiction of the subject matter, in admiralty, after the proofs are in, is controlled by allocations of the libel or by the proofs as reconciled to the libel, in other words, the scope of review in a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.460" offset="721816">And the third question involved is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals actually had jurisdiction to review the District Court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.605" offset="766328">The facts, as found by the District Court, comes to this Court undisturbed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.143" offset="804571">In the libel, the libelants alleged subordinate allocation showing fraud upon the part of the respondent such as absconding, concealing himself, making himself judgment proof during the time endeavoring to procure jurisdiction over him to pursue their causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.873" offset="911464">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the causes of action for these passengers was simply the old common law, form of indebitatus assumpsit, money having received in which admiralty had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.115" offset="980428">Our contention is that admiralty does have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.725" offset="1002893">The jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution of the United States, Article 3 Section 2, conferring judicial power in the federal courts to all cases of admiralty in maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.805" offset="1059213">Now, the jurisdiction on the federal courts, some few years shortly after the adoption of the Constitution was a subject for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.098" offset="1116369">And Congress, in 1789, rendered a legislative interpretation of the meaning of Article 3 of the Constitution and the scope of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.532" offset="1166106">In 1848, this Court rendered its first decision wherein it covered the jurisdiction of admiralty over contract actions which prior to that -- prior to 1848, apparently had not existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.455" offset="1269760">In that particular case, the New Jersey Steam Navigation against Merchants' Bank, now this Court held that it's the subject matter of the contract which determines the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.505" offset="1317930">And once the admiralty has jurisdiction of the contract, the jurisdiction may not be confined to any one particular remedy on the contract, but all remedies are -- are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.544" offset="1382087">But the question then now as it's (Inaudible) down here, whether or not, because these petitioners brought their actions on admiralty, the remedies are less than they would have, had they pursued them at common law if they were able to pursue them in a common lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.789" offset="1463066">Now, it has been held by this Court that freight is to consideration for the use of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.204" offset="1492741">And that it applies also to the consideration paid by passengers for their transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.737" offset="1530880">Now, whether the transportation be for cargo, for cadavers, or for human beings, the consideration is freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.671" offset="1566616">And that the -- the term "freight" is one which is always been within the jurisdiction of admiralty and the shipowner, for many years, has always been able to sue an admiralty to recover freight which he has earned for the performance of the contract of maritime transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.842" offset="1671314">There had never been any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.265" offset="1681032">Now, the situation in this particular case is that the passengers prepaid the freight and they received no transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.137" offset="1712483">It was our contention that, under the doctrine of equality, under the law or equal application of the law and plain common sense, that if the shipowner could sue a shipper or a passenger for the consideration due to him for contract of transportation, that passenger has reciprocal right to sue the shipowner in admiralty to recover the earnings of prepaid freights, which is what they did in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.510" offset="1837976">Now, there are not many cases involving passengers in the law reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.545" offset="1862113">But those cases which are on the law reports hold that passing these actions for recovery of prepaid freights are within the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.594" offset="1910282">A hundred years ago, the Second Circuit held in (Inaudible) that the moneys having received pursuant to a contract for passenger transportation was within the jurisdiction of admiralty that the duties, the implied duties annexed to a marine contract of carriers just as maritime as to contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.097" offset="2020310">And that the implied duty to refund, money having received to which the shipowner having earned was just as maritime passed the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.405" offset="2057613">Now, during the tendency of this cause before this Court on the writ, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has rendered the decision which I have arranged with the clerk to provide to the Court on February the 24th, 1956, which, in effect, repudiates the authorities upon which that same court had reversed the decree in this particular case, the Archawski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.630" offset="2214452">The decision on reargument, dated February the 24th, 1956, virtually adapts the argument of the petitioners in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.015" offset="2260010">And it clarifies its previous original decision of December, 1955, which had not yet been reported at the time of the briefs in behalf of the petitions were filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.637" offset="2330540">Now, this Court has stated back around 1933 in Krauss against Dimon Lumber Ship Company, that admiralty is not concerned with the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.701" offset="2370769">Admiralty is concerned only with the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.795" offset="2391144">And it is -- this Court has held time and time again that when a case is up for review, the reviewing court must take the whole record before end and reconcile the facts to the pleadings to do justice where justices do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.074" offset="7884278">I would like to -- to submit to Your Honors this basic dilemma that I think confronted the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.445" offset="7937776">As I have note -- as I have mentioned to you, the decree of the District Court provided for an order of arrest, this was pursuant to the Civil Practice Act of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.917" offset="7999634">Their dilemma, however, was this, that if they brought the action for breach of contract in this case, they will not entitle to an order of arrest under the New York Civil Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.075" offset="8048222">The case of Novotny against Kosloff, decided by the New York Court of Appeals in 214, New York 12 so held and the Court actually said, “A liability to responding damages for a nonperformance of the contract in refusing to carry it out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.439" offset="8161698">In this case, for discharging the plaintiff in violation of its terms, it cannot be said to be incurred until the breach is actually committed, and is unrelated to the fraud in the making of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.099" offset="8220317">Now, on the other hand, the Civil Practice Act provides for an order of arrest for an action in fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.404" offset="8249574">But in that case, they are impelled upon the other one of the dilemma because an action in fraud, a land tort is not cognizable in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.565" offset="8294191">And I submit to Your Honors that you must read the libel with this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.396" offset="8317492">This is the dilemma that confronted the risk for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.146" offset="8332539">This is the dilemma that they had to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.815" offset="8343197">And if -- if you hold that this was an action for breach of contract cognizable in admiralty, which I respectfully submit would not be warranted, then it seems to me this case should go back to the Court of Appeals to consider whether there was warrant for issuing the order of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.745" offset="8438909">If on the other hand, you read the libel as I submit it must be read as one stating a cause of action in tort against an individual with whom there was no contractual liability alleged or proved except on the basis of the theory of alter ego, then you have a case clearly sounding in fraud which is a land tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.132" offset="8560431">I have jumped into my argument because of the questions that were raised, but I wish to submit to the Court some of the facts that I have gleaned from the record in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.129" offset="8632424">The City of Athens was purchased by this Hungarian corporation for $430,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.166" offset="8676624">So far as this record shows, that ship was held free and clear of any lien or mortgage, however, substantial repairs and under -- and alterations were undertaken of this vessel and were performed by the Todd Shipyard Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.051" offset="8768157">The evidence shows that it was expected, that the bill would run anywhere from $80,000 to $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.020" offset="8819984">The total repair bill, and there was a second repair necessitated by heavy weather damage, ran to close to $750,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.583" offset="8870243">Nevertheless, the City of Athens had completed four roundtrip voyages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.339" offset="8933355">The sail of the City of Athens, a forced sail, brought $400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.983" offset="8971912">Now, these libelants intervened in the proceedings in Baltimore in order to assert a lien for their passage money and they were represented by their present counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.012" offset="9031993">They asserted that that money was used for the purchase of supplies, for the payment of the crew, and for the payment of part of the Todd Shipyards bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.603" offset="9090403">And indeed, the record shows that $270,000 were paid to Todd Shipyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.730" offset="9118824">The commissioner who heard the evidence made this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.346" offset="9137319">He said a shipowner must necessarily secure funds from freight or passengers, and if it purchases supplies for its vessels or has them repaired, it is only from such funds unless it borrows the money on its personal credit or that of the vessel, that such purchases are -- or repairs can be paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.876" offset="9215478">From the record here, it may be assumed that the passage moneys were so employed resulting in certain liens being reduced or paid off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.859" offset="9431353">The passage tickets in this case were purchased according to the record on file here from the months of February until July.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.549" offset="9470119">Between February and July, at least two and possibly three roundtrip voyages were made by the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.202" offset="9508780">The ship was libeled on January -- on July 15, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.238" offset="9544934">Only five tickets were sold after that date and since tickets were being sold all over the United States and Europe, it may reasonably be assumed, I submit, that this was simply because of the difficulty in time of getting it known that the voyages would have to be canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.541" offset="9614106">I think from this, it is difficult to assume that there was any fraud here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.551" offset="9650155">The District Court rounded its decision on the insolvency of the corporate owner of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.879" offset="9683487">But there is nothing in the record to show that it actually was insolvent, you had a ship for which $430,000 was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.836" offset="9715252">Surely, it was worth more than that after the expense of repairs and alterations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.513" offset="10069995">I respectfully submit that if you read this libel and script from it the allegations of fraud, it does not state a cause of action against anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.150" offset="10212519">Now, with respect to the argument that this, as an action in contract, is cognizable in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.638" offset="10270511">The Bryer case which is relied upon rather heavily by the petitioners was one in which there have been a union of ship and cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.042" offset="10332160">The failure of the ship to carry the goods gave the case a maritime situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.112" offset="10364447">And in that sense, it is not analogous to this case where there was no union of ship and cargo or ship and passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.492" offset="10409900">The only other real case on which the petitioners rely is the case of Swift against Compania Columbiana which is cited both in the petitioner's brief and in respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.029" offset="10476042">In that case, this Court pointed out that fraud is not the business of admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.120" offset="10520451">And I presume that they were there talking about fraud irrespective of whether it was in tort or in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.071" offset="10556186">However, the Court said that that would not prevent admiralty from protecting its jurisdiction once it have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.233" offset="10600908">But I submit that before there was any jurisdiction for admiralty to protect, it must first acquire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.251" offset="10632986">Now, in the Swift case, what happened was that a libel was filed for the cargo damage arising out of negligence of a ship that was presumably wrecked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.202" offset="10676767">The libel was filed against the corporate owner of the vessel and an attachment was asked against another vessel that it owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.070" offset="10716264">The next day, a supplemental and demanded libel was filed alleging that the corporation had transferred the vessel to a dummy corporation that it had set up for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.873" offset="10787422">The Court held that having had jurisdiction of the original libel as it clearly did, it could protect its jurisdiction even with respect to the allegations of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.783" offset="10867043">Now, the -- the case of Silva versus the Finance Company, and United Transportation both decided in the Second Circuit, I submit, are sound law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.654" offset="10934544">As this Court has sometimes noted, decisions are sometimes made in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.390" offset="10969548">But in those cases, the quasi contracts which they said were not cognizable in admiralty arose in the case of United Transportation out of a fraud because of the common officer of the two corporations who put through this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.686" offset="11034645">And in the Silva case, because it was an action against a person who was not a party to the maritime contract, namely, the Finance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.624" offset="11074456">Before my time expires, I wish to address myself to one question and that is the appealability of the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.581" offset="11110296">A decree was entered on December 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.101" offset="11128372">On December 7th, a motion was made to vacate the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.139" offset="11156480">The moving party urged not only that the default was not willful, but also that the warrant of attachment was not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.624" offset="11202456">The Court so treated the motion because in the opinion, which is in the transcript, he addressed himself to the propriety of the issuance of the warrant of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.007" offset="11248013">And so as I submit that a motion to modify a judgment as this in effect was at least involved is a rule under 50 -- is within rule 59 (e) which timely filed as this one was, told the time within which the statute of -- the -- the time to appeal starts to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.977" offset="11339860">And Rule 73 so holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.065" offset="11352189">I think it's Rule 73 which says that a rule made under Section -- Rule 59 -- stops the time running.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.990" offset="11387925">In any event, there were two other motions -- two other appeals filed from the denial of the motion to vacate the default, they were timely made, they were appealable orders and the case was properly before the Court of Appeals and once surely a court can decide the jurisdictional question at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.029" offset="11472039">Besides, I regret that I have not been able to argue this thing more extensively, may I have leave to file a supplemental memorandum.</text>
