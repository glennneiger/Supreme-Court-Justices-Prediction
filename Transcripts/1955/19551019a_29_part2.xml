            <label>Ms. Gloria Agrin</label>
            <text syncTime="5.515" offset="22047">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.002" offset="28003">I was at a point of describing the provisions of the orders of supervision which were drawn and issued by the appellee herein to each of the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.265" offset="80980">One provision which was constant throughout all of the orders was a requirement that the appellee -- each of the appellants report to an officer of the Immigration Service once weekly on Ellis Island to New York Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.440" offset="141688">After these actions were began in the court below, that provision was changed to once monthly and when for budgetary reasons, the Ellis Island establishment was closed, the place of reporting was changed to some place on the Island of Manhattan at 70 Columbus Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.357" offset="221414">The orders further require the aliens to notify the Service of change of residence and change of employment within 48 hours after such change is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.720" offset="266867">The appellants are also required to apply for permission for a change of residence from the Third Immigration District to any other immigration district in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.846" offset="319321">They are required also by the order to report for psychiatric and medical examination when it is necessary and to give such information as may be deemed fit and proper under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.232" offset="380865">In more than half of the orders, the appellants are prohibited from going outside of an area within 50 miles from Times Square in New York, I assume as the crow flies.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.694" offset="430707">Each of the order contains a directive that the alien terminate membership in the Communist Party per se or association with the Communist Party per se, or any of its branches, subdivisions or affiliates, either here or in any other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.394" offset="501551">Another section of the order requires that the alien terminate associations with any individuals they know to be Communists or who aid and further the policies and doctrines of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.004" offset="559961">There was an exception made for spouses and attorneys, provided however that association with such spouse or attorney is not done in furtherance of the doctrines or the policies of the Communist Party, of any of its branches, subdivisions or geographical differentiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.510" offset="633940">The aliens are also directed by the order, which subjects them of course to criminal penalty for violation of it within a -- with an additional criminal penalty not to violate the Smith Act or the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.044" offset="708127">After these orders were issued to each of these appellants, the actions which the appeal is being taken from were commenced in the District Court under Title V Section 1009, the appellants contending that they were parties aggrieved by the administrative order of the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.405" offset="801541">These actions asked for the relief authorized by Section 1009 (b) of declaratory judgment and auxiliary injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.879" offset="847412">They asked that the statute in question 1252 (d), the regulation promulgated under the statute 8 C.F.R. 242.3 (c), as applied by the orders of supervision issued to each of these plaintiffs was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.577" offset="926302">They also asked that the District Director, the appellant -- appellee, be directed to cancel the orders and be directed not to seek compliance with them and not to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.858" offset="987429">Temporary stays of varying kinds were granted by the individual judges to whom orders -- orders to show cause were directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.615" offset="1026403">The Government made motions to dismiss the complaint on the ground that there was the failure to join an improper party, on the ground further that it did not play the cause of action and to vacate the temporary restraining orders which were exempt at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.365" offset="1097456">They also asked for the convocation of a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2282 and 2284.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.509" offset="1129953">The appellants did not oppose the convocation of a three-judge court.It was convened -- it consisted of Circuit Judge Medina and District Judges McGohey and Weinfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.823" offset="1183242">They reheard argument on June 30th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.065" offset="1200170">In October of 1954, they handed down their decision which granted the relief requested by the Government on the sole ground that there was no present case and controversy between the Party's plaintiff and the Party's defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.981" offset="1271850">The decision of the court below did not reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.389" offset="1301525">It is the appellant's contention --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="327.466" offset="1309780">(Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gloria_agrin" startTime="333.913" stopTime="857.981">
            <label>Ms. Gloria Agrin</label>
            <text syncTime="333.913" offset="1335589">We have brought an action only under the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.375" offset="1357427">The second paragraph of Section 1009 says that such an action may be brought in many forms, in the form of a declaratory judgment, in the form of an injunction action, in the form of a writ of habeas corpus, which does not -- is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.128" offset="1416464">But it is not being brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.851" offset="1439347">It is our contention that the facts and circumstances of this case prevent -- present a classic example of a justiciable case in controversy, the lower court to the contrary notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.139" offset="1488457">The main thrust of our argument on the merits, as Mrs. Freedman shall show, is that it is unlawful and unconstitutional to restrict the conduct and activities of these appellants under this statute 1252 (d), under the regulation promulgated under the statute as applied to each of these appellants by the orders of supervision issued severally against each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.909" offset="1611546">This in effect is the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.777" offset="1627011">There are many reasons why our contention -- reasons urged for our contentions of unlawfulness and unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.958" offset="1655745">But the only issue is the issue relating to the validity of the statute as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.605" offset="1682390">In relation to this, the Government concedes and you will find it at pages 26 of their brief and at 32 and 33, and I quote from page 26, "This one issue seems to meet the minimum constitutional requirements of a case or controversy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="438.770" offset="1755011">The appellants grow up from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.874" offset="1763474">The logical conclusion therefore that the controversy should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.199" offset="1784790">The Government, on the other hand, engages in what I would consider a futile search to find reasons why the controversy should not be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.929" offset="1831706">It will be interesting for the Court to note that the Government abandons the position of the court below as to why this case and controversy should not be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.972" offset="1875801">The court below had found that there was no present controversy for the reason that the orders of supervision were not self-executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.894" offset="1919478">I call only briefly to the Court's attention, its decision in Columbia Broadcasting System against the United States, which is cited in our brief, that's at 316 U.S, where this Court said, "The regulations are not less reviewable because their promulgation did not operate of their own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.008" offset="1999935">When they are promulgated by order, they are appropriately subject of attack.”</text>
            <text syncTime="505.369" offset="2021460">The same doctrine is carried through in enumerable decisions, among them Parker against Fleming, La Crosse Telephone against Wisconsin Employment Board and the several others that are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.827" offset="2075272">So that in this respect, the opinion of the court below is obviously contrary to what this Court has previously held.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.492" offset="2105887">The second ground, which one would assume that the Court relied on, was that this appellant was not an adverse -- this appellee was not an adverse party to the appellant for the reason that the statute becomes enforceable by criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.120" offset="2180389">This Court too, when I called to its attention, its decision in Rochester Telephone Company in 307 U.S. and Shields against Utah Railroad Company in 305 U.S., to the effect that even in relation to a statute where the sanctions are criminal, the order itself is considered part of the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.507" offset="2265966">And the issuance of the order by the administrator makes that administrator an adverse party and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.068" offset="2316225">It is another reason that we submit that the decision of the court below is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.119" offset="2336392">I should like to turn only for a few moments to the positions adapted by the Government instead of the position of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.379" offset="2373486">They seem to fall into two minor categories and one major category, and I applied the characterization of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.924" offset="2411624">I, myself, can't distinguish why one is minor and the other is major.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.659" offset="2430537">One of the minor categories and reasons that the Government says that this case should not presently be decided is because the appellants have not exhausted their administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.019" offset="2472020">I have pointed out to the Court that neither the statute nor the code of federal regulation establishes any remedy for either the modification of the orders of supervision, once they are issued by the District Director or from an appeal from the orders for any reason whether the grounds of unconstitutionality or on the grounds of unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.767" offset="2563030">The Government's argument boils down simply to this, that this appellant had not begged the District Director to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.480" offset="2593855">They have not gone in and said look, this creates terrible problems for me, and if the District Director had a good breakfast and felt well that morning, he might change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.908" offset="2631576">It has never been my experience, and I have found no case in this Court where begging, pleading or shouting over a telephone was considered an administrative remedy that had to be exhausted before review could be held in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.895" offset="2695523">I would challenge the Government to find a regulation, a written rule which gives these appellants some recourse from the order once it has been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.264" offset="2740976">There is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.178" offset="2744633">There is no administrative procedure that needs to be exhausted before going into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.620" offset="2774413">The second minor premise of the Government's argument is that many of the appellant's contentions are remote and speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.705" offset="2814746">I submit that this conclusion on the part of the Government can only be drawn from a misapprehension of the arguments made by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.119" offset="2860408">One of the grounds urged for the unconstitutionality of the statute on its phase and as applied, is that the statute is vague and indefinite in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.818" offset="2919236">In their brief, the appellants have tried to show the manner in which the words used are as broad as to create confusion as to what the duties and obligations of each of the individual appellants might be under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.160" offset="2980571">That some or all of these things may be -- may happen, as it may happen under any vague statute, is not to be contested but we have a present claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.435" offset="3021740">A present claim to the vagueness of the statute and we do not ask that future possibilities under this vague statute be -- be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.399" offset="3057580">We ask that now, this statute that is perfectly bad because of its vagueness be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.825" offset="3079210">And that, as far as we are concerned sir, is the argument to the remote and speculative contention of the Government as -- as it relates to our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.917" offset="3123618">The Government seeks to avoid its major concession as to justiciability by the judicious use of artful adjectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.446" offset="3165727">They say, yes, you have a case in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.663" offset="3178580">They say, yes, you have adverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.676" offset="3190700">They say, yes, an order, a judgment of a court can solve the controversy between you.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.814" offset="3227167">But they say it shouldn't do it here because there is no concrete factual background.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.777" offset="3251096">Our constitutional issues they say are ill-defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.180" offset="3268650">And they cite as authority for not accepting review of the case, the cases of United Public Workers against Mitchell and the International Longshoremen against Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.403" offset="3313580">Those were the factual situations of those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.702" offset="3326746">They are not of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.887" offset="3339494">The appellant contends that we have here against each of the appellants a final administrative order, saved of course, if they are required to beg for a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.805" offset="3387141">It commands each of the appellants to do or refrain from doing certain specified act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.301" offset="12133146">The real problem here and the knob of this case can be very simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.086" offset="12164284">Appellants are aliens who have been actually ordered deported on account of membership in a subversive organization, the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.793" offset="12207125">Now, the basic question is whether these aliens have a constitutional right to be free from all supervision, no matter how reasonable it is, pending their ultimate deportation once six months have passed without deportation being effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.933" offset="12287687">I think that's a fair statement of the hardcore problem which is presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.996" offset="12323944">There's another basic issue on the merits, which we cannot ignore, whether such aliens have a constitutional right to continue their subversive associations and activities, pending ultimate deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.802" offset="12399177">As I understand the appellant's argument, they have a right to continue membership in the Communist Party and to continue Communist activities and associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.055" offset="12456124">However, before reaching these basic constitutional issues, we have to consider a threshold issue of jurisdiction -- of justiciability, whether a case or controversy appropriate for judicial determination has been alleged by these 14 appellants or rather these 11 appellants as to whom the order is currently applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.566" offset="12582243">It is to that threshold problem which the first part of my argument will be directed, whether these broad issues on the merits are properly before the Court, depends on the solution of the threshold issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.825" offset="12667298">As Ms. Agrin pointed out, the court below did not reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.628" offset="12690495">It assumed that no justiciable case or controversy had been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.280" offset="12725081">Now, this is a case where they challenge statue and the administrative rulings issued under it, have we concede some degree of present impact on this litigants?</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.913" offset="12787566">The other hand, the impact is hard to pin down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.820" offset="12803239">It is partially in the present, it appears to be substantially in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.918" offset="12831660">And the real question is where to draw the line, as regards to the degree of present impact, which it is -- which is necessary to have in order to make a matter justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.725" offset="12886831">Now, we have real trouble with one facet of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.907" offset="12911595">As we concede in our brief, the arguments are very close on justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.868" offset="12935419">We have made an advocate's presentation of those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.182" offset="12952660">We feel we're obligated to the Court to do so under its prior decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5636.215" offset="22544823">Questions like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="6148.091" offset="24592300">I believe at this point, I've pretty well exhausted the third and the fourth is the requirement that the alien be made to conform to such reasonable written restrictions on his conduct and activities as prescribed by the attorney general in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.843" offset="24667324">Now, that is fairly broad and yet when you look at the purposes of -- of the statute, the purposes of supervision and read that provision with those purposes in mind, we believe that it is sufficiently definite to meet the constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.606" offset="24766380">After all, what are the purposes of supervision?</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.424" offset="24777665">They're implementing the deportation statute, keeping track of the alien, getting information, trying to make it more difficult to prevent the alien from fading into the population as we have seen some of the defendants in the Dennis case do very successfully, too successfully in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.381" offset="24869512">And the other purpose of preventing the continuation of the type of undesirable activity which was the basis for deportation, and that brings me to Mr. Justice Douglas' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.883" offset="24911517">Here, the deportation was bottomed on membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.983" offset="24951850">The only sanction against an alien being a member in the Communist Party was the -- well, there are two sanctions, there's the Smith Act for a certain type of activity and the sanction of being deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.665" offset="25026560">The sanction of deportation, the deterrence which may be implicit and that are gone now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.695" offset="25062713">The threat of deportation is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.293" offset="25073162">They faced the worst and the Government is powerless to carry the thing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.086" offset="25092284">Now, is Congress free to -- is Congress to have their hands tied and say, "If you can't find some foreign country to take these deportable aliens, if you're going to have them in your midst, then you cannot limit the kind of activity which resulted in their being undesirable citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6301.570" offset="25206178">Now, that's what the administrators obviously driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6305.298" offset="25221120">We believe it's clearly within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.477" offset="25233868">It's very difficult to graft a proper provision, that's the kind of provision which we would like to have any individual problems, call to the attention of the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6320.447" offset="25281724">Any of these people who are deprived from seeing their family or associating with their family.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.680" offset="25314638">We are sure that that would be on this record, it has been taken care of in any part of that was issued after a certain date, presumably after the point it was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.592" offset="25362286">Now, just what precise limits should be put on that association, that is something we believe it has be worked out on a case by case basis and it's too broad to litigate at this time in advance of specific applications.</text>
