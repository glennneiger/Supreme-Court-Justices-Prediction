            <label>Mr. William H. Webb</label>
            <text syncTime="2.741" offset="10867">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.106" offset="20376">Going now to the facts of this case, in November 1934, Cold Metal filed its complaint seeking inter alia specific performance of a contract that have been entered into in 1927 between it and United and under which United was to acquire certain rights under a patent which it later acted and which became patent 195.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.353" offset="165407">United sought dismissal of that action in its answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.101" offset="184320">In January 1935, there was a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain United from the performance of certain acts which we believe were improper in view of the contractual relationships existing between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.306" offset="269166">The injunction was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.496" offset="277943">That was reversed however by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.056" offset="292153">The case went back then to the District Court and in view of the holdings of the Court of Appeals when the case was there the first time Cold Metal filed a supplemental complaint in which it sought alternatively rescission of the contract for specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.869" offset="387448">The case came on for final hearing before the District Court in October of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.048" offset="412108">And in January 1938, the District Court rendered an opinion denying rescission of the contract and granting specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.580" offset="470309">In June of 1939, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court as to no rescission and affirmed the granting of specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.044" offset="532167">Then in June 1941, after the mandate had gone down, United moved for a leave to file what it called a second supplemental answer and counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.883" offset="587442">And in that pleading where they filed at that time, it sought substantially the same relief as it now seeks in its pending counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.772" offset="643030">In February 1942, that motion was denied in an opinion which is the Court of the 43 F. Supp.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.233" offset="684931">Then the decree on mandate was not entered immediately but it was entered in September of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.155" offset="732578">And that decree provided that Cold Metal was entitled to recover royalties from United under this contract and that decree appointed a master to determine the amount that was due under the contract and the rate at which the royalty payments were to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.952" offset="843755">There was an accounting held before the master and in that accounting, one of the contentions which was made by United was that there was a failure of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.632" offset="898508">And United, in support of its defensive failure of consideration, asserted substantially the same things as it has asserted in this counterclaim which I am going to come to.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.713" offset="1018776">And then in 107 F.2d was before the Court of Appeals, and then it was there again in a decision reported at 190 F.2d and then, of course, it got there on this recent appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.723" offset="1082828">So, it's four times instead of three, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="274.643" offset="1098501">Did they face on the merits of the controversy before the accounting was held?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.407" offset="1121593">They did, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.423" offset="1125669">They passed on the merits of the controversy granting specific performance to Cold Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.048" offset="1152104">Namely, they ordered that Cold Metal under the agreement was entitled to recover royalties from United under this contract which had been entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.152" offset="1204558">And then as I say the case went back to --</text>

          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="304.083" stopTime="307.836">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="304.083" offset="1216261">How did it -- how did they get that up?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.100" offset="1220336">Was that a final judgement within 1291?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_webb" startTime="307.836" stopTime="987.970">
            <label>Mr. William H. Webb</label>
            <text syncTime="307.836" offset="1231308">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.166" offset="1232562">That -- well -- well, they could have taken that case up at that time because there was a denial of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.695" offset="1262759">That's right, a certain injunctive relief had been asked for and the case went up under 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.218" offset="1292852">But in 1949, now going to this counterclaim, in 1949, while this case was before the master while the accounting was going on, United filed in the District Court what it called an ?Ancillary Cross Complaint? that Civil Action No. 7744.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.100" offset="1388356">That cross complaint was again based on the same facts as those asserted by United in the accounting proceeding as constituting failure of consideration, but in that Ancillary Cross Complaint, United was seeking first injunctive relief to prevent Cold Metal from prosecuting certain suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.606" offset="1490338">Second, it was asking for an accounting as to royalties Cold Metal had received from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.755" offset="1518968">Third, it was asking that the royalties they set off against any award that might be made to Cold Metal in this case which is Equity 2991.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.193" offset="1576751">And fourth, they were asking -- United was asking for damages arising out of the fact that it says it was forced to participate in certain of the patent infringement that the infringement litigation of Cold Metal had brought against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.338" offset="1645296">Well, on August 28, 1950, on Cold Metal's motion that Ancillary Cross Complaint was dismissed on the ground that it was not ancillary to Equity 2991.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.160" offset="1724604">And the Court did not have jurisdiction, I might add, unless the cross complaint could have been considered as ancillary to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.641" offset="1774550">The Court dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.780" offset="1779043">United appealed and in June 1951, in an opinion reported at 190 F.2d 217, the Court of Appeals held that United's pleading was in reality, a counterclaim in this action and it remanded the case for further considerations by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.993" offset="1883951">Now, the Court of Appeals expressly held that this pleading was a counterclaim that it grew out of the same transaction or occurrence as Cold Metal's main claim and that it would have been a compulsory counterclaim had it matured when United's original answer was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.394" offset="1989486">But nevertheless, there is that positive holding by the Court of Appeals that it arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as Cold Metal's main claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.116" offset="2040372">But when the case went back to the District Court, United amended its pleading in October 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.979" offset="2075899">And after getting leave of court to file, it did file this counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.850" offset="2111321">Now, the Cold Metal filed its reply thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.452" offset="2129711">Now, in that still pending and unadjudicated counterclaim, United has pleaded the same facts as those on which it relied before the master in support of its defensive failure of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.551" offset="2210168">And in the counterclaim, the same facts are relied upon as a basis for recoupment or set off against the amount ultimately, awarded to Cold Metal by the master and the District Court on the claim asserted in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.330" offset="2293238">More specifically, in this counterclaim, United is asking for injunctive relief against some suits brought by Cold Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.242" offset="2336914">It is asking for an accounting as to this royalties alledgedly collected by Cold Metal in United's field of license and it is asking for a recovery from Cold Metal of those royalties to a sufficient extent to enable it to have recoupment or setoff as against any amount that Cold Metal has been awarded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.737" offset="2462929">And United also is seeking damages by reason of the fact that if has had to participate in certain patent litigation which Cold Metal brought against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.324" offset="2525205">Now, United did not even seek a hearing on that counterclaim while this case was before the master although it was filed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.919" offset="2571598">But in May of 1954, the report of the master came down and the -- the master awarded Cold Metal some $300,000 in royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.545" offset="2630113">And in the summer of 1954, while the parties were preparing objections to the master's report, this counterclaim was about to come on for trial before Judge Miller in the District Court and both parties went to Judge Miller and said, "Well, let's hold this up until after we dispose of the matter of the objections to the report of a special master which we are at present preparing.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.351" offset="2757381">For those that the judge was perfectly to postpone the trial pending, the disposition of those objections by the District Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="701.994" offset="2807954">In December of 1954, there was a hearing on the objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.896" offset="2831569">In January of 1955, the District Court filed an opinion and entered an order confirming the master's report and directing entry of judgement for Cold Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.282" offset="2889038">In February of 1955, United appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.997" offset="2907951">Cold Metal moved to dismiss on the ground that it was not a final appealable order in view of the dependency of this unadjudicated counterclaim seeking recoupment and also in view of the fact that the judgment did not contain the talismanic language of Rule 54 (b) as an amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.917" offset="3007634">Then in March of 1955, the Court of Appeals held the judgment was not a final decision and dismissed United's appeal without prejudice to the right of United to apply to the District Court for a new order if the District Court offered to include this language a determination required under rule -- amended Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="777.764" offset="3110975">So, on March 30th of 1955 on United's motion, the January 15, 1955 order was vacated and -- and an amended order was added and that amended order is substantially identical with the original order of January 19, 1955 except that it does include the express determination of no just reason for delay and a direct entry of judgment pursuant to amended Rule 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="812.918" offset="3251618">And on March 31st, enforcement of that judgment was stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.542" offset="3278158">We attempted to prevail upon the District Court to not enter the -- an amended Rule 54 (b) order because we felt that we were entitled to get an adjudication of this counterclaim that arose out of the same transaction prior to having to again go to the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.685" offset="3378678">The proceedings in the District Court you will find in the record, they show that the District Court really did not give consideration to the counterclaim and inserted what it termed, this magic sentence or Rule 54 (b) in the order despite the tendency of the counterclaim seeking recoupment despite the fact that it was impressed upon him after the time that the proposed amended order was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.292" offset="3517127">The sole reason given by the District Court for including this magic sentence in the order was that it originally intended to enter a final judgment and that it wanted enlightenment from the Court of Appeals to assist it in determining the issues raised by the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.469" offset="3613780">That appears at pages 69, 70 and 71 of the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.920" offset="3639589">Even though the District Court did use that talismanic language of the rule, it obviously did not intend to relinquish control over or the right to modify that judgement for it expressly said.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.245" offset="3708970">And you'll find this at page 68 of the record, that if the Court of Appeals affirmed, then, the counterclaim can be asserted against the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.591" offset="3762364">United, of course, appealed from the District Court's order and we again moved to dismiss on the ground that the amended order and judgment did not constitute a final decision under Section 1291, since there was no adjudication of United's counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.275" offset="3869048">And in April of 1955, the Court of Appeals denied that motion and filed a short opinion in the holding that a determination made by the District Court under the circumstances of this case was the very kind of thing that Rule 54 (b) was written to provide for.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.994" offset="3947938">Well, does --</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.543" offset="5574113">We are here standing squarely under that rule and it has been applied to our case by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.027" offset="5608072">The trial judge who are going back a little and I saw -- try not to repeat what Mr. Webb has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.265" offset="5644957">There was a litigation between these parties under a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.967" offset="5663765">It land up first on the preliminary injunction motion and then it went up again on final hearing and there was a final decision made on the contract in 2991, which is the case, the parent case that's here before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.832" offset="5743282">That case then went back to the lower court and appointed a master to determine how much United owed to Cold Metal under the contract in suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.855" offset="5795318">That was the matter that was referred to the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.947" offset="5807752">The master took 10 years on this partly due to the -- the war coming in between and due to the fact that the United States brought a suit to have the parties declared void for having been obtained by fraud in the patent office and that took some of the time out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.967" offset="5879850">But there was a 10-year long proceeding on accounting which entered in a decision by the master awarding $387,000 plus with interest of 6% from United to Cold Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.711" offset="5942753">Now, that came up to -- before a hearing before Judge Wilson, who is a District Judge having charged with this case at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.186" offset="5984653">And it was argued on the basis of the master's report entirely and upon the record entered before the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.115" offset="6012447">Nothing else was presented to Judge Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.904" offset="6023523">Judge Wilson heard it, took exhausted briefs, gives the whole aid to have it argued and finally affirmed the master's report, and sua sponte without any request to either party entered a final judgement and an order confirming the master's report and awarding this amount with interest against United.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.088" offset="6480248">I said in effect it said and I'm saying now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.689" offset="6490697">In effect, Judge Maris said, Well, gentlemen, you've got Rule 54 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.178" offset="6564676">But in Judge Maris' opinion or order, he said without prejudice to the lower court, entering a final judgment in compliance with 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.966" offset="6607830">So, we went back to Pittsburgh and gave the five day of notice which our opponents required of asking for an amended order and went before Judge Wilson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.751" offset="6658926">We said that we wanted to -- an order under 54 (b) to comply with it because the Court of Appeals had dismissed our appeal as not having complied with 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.996" offset="6703961">Mr. Webb argued at great length just as we had here today that the Court had no power to enter such an order, and if it did, it would be reversed and if it did it would be unconstitutional and blah, blah, blah.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.761" offset="7310942">But there are other questions -- there are other questions involved and may I -- may I sir, I say I think answering your question point out some other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.336" offset="7353260">The counterclaim, that is the so-called counterclaim that is pending arose out of transactions occurring after the Third Circuit Court of Appeals had heard the case on appeal from trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.648" offset="7418567">In other words, Cold Metal had maintained then as it still does that United had no license rights and the Court of Appeals after trial it said, "Yes, you have this license rights but you must pay for them."</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.119" offset="7468408">And then -- then apparent and then in effect left the case there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.960" offset="7483768">Now that was in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.247" offset="7492963">Well now, instead of following that decision of the Court of Appeals, United went out and commenced licensing distilled companies unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.966" offset="7531833">And I used the word "quoted" because it's in their license to make the very thing that United was licensed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.511" offset="7562031">In addition, they collected, they say $28 million and then it was later placed in the record they said, they collected $30 million in this field which normally would view within United exclusive license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.370" offset="7609469">Now, Judge Biggs in his decision on 190 F.2d said United had no rights that could it litigate until after our decision in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.397" offset="7649489">Because in an earlier decision by the same Circuit Court of Appeals, they have said, "This contract cannot be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.123" offset="7680418">It lacks terms and it -- if not get fully specific enforcement."</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.392" offset="7697554">Consequently, Your Honor, I'm answering your question now, there were issues that rose in there after 1939 and after 1940 and contending even after the present day because Cold Metal is still suing Republic Steel Company and United States Government, I believe, and a lot of other companies for the use of the very mills upon which United had been required under master's report to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.256" offset="7800999">So that it isn't something that is inherent in the matter that was before the master.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.674" offset="8174655">This came in as a counterclaim because Judge Biggs of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals made a start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.467" offset="8201822">We filed an ancillary complaint to enforce the Court's decree in 1939 and in -- and the 2506 before in which he said we had a license but Cold Metal was constantly ignoring it and defying it and violating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.208" offset="8260754">And we understood and you correct me, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.612" offset="8282384">We understood that that was one of the functions of an ancillary suit to enforce the decree of a court after it had become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.668" offset="8318642">And we filed an ancillary of cross complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.437" offset="8333688">And we filed it in the District Court where Cold Metal had pending a litigation and we went clear to the Court of Appeals that the lower courts says it's not ancillary and threw it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.698" offset="8390740">Well, Judge Biggs said it's clearly ancillary, there's no question about that why it should have been a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.033" offset="8416131">It should not have been ancillary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.194" offset="8424699">It should have been a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.851" offset="8431386">Well I've always found that you get along faster ruling with the Court and then you're trying to form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.590" offset="8450299">So we went back, still convinced that it was properly an ancillary suit and we called it, and the man did ancillary complaint and in part the counterclaim and that's the way it stands today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.044" offset="8496170">Now, if Your Honor please, let me -- let me come down to two or three other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.652" offset="8514560">Mr. -- my opponent has argued, as I understand it, that this rule is beyond the rule making power of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.234" offset="8544862">Now I'm not going in to that at all except that I might be ask questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.396" offset="8557505">We have no doubt of it being properly within the rule making power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.646" offset="8574537">And I have enough presumption to try to tell you anyhow if I even thought it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.466" offset="8589793">I think that's -- you made the rule and you've got to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.639" offset="8602540">That's the way I look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.935" offset="8607660">As far as I'm concern, it's a good rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.849" offset="8615393">So far as the Third Circuit is concerned, it's a good rule and we stand on the Bendix case which applies to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.080" offset="8640261">Now, these -- a lot of these preliminary questions and the ones that you are -- Honor Judge -- Mr. Justice Frank was asked had been brought up before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.681" offset="8678713">Mr. Webb argued to Judge Wilson, "Well, you can't enter a final decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.050" offset="8696163">You've got pending a counterclaim over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.046" offset="8704104">It's like I don't know anything about the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.012" offset="8712046">This field, the case I've decided, this is 2991 and the pleadings and everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.691" offset="8730749">And everything the master did is before me and that's what I'm deciding, that's what I intend to decide finally and there's nothing else before me and you didn't raise anything else before me, Mr. Webb."</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.822" offset="8779233">Now, we went up to the Court of Appeals and the same thing came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.282" offset="8793025">The only thing that was argued in our first, in the first motion to dismiss in the Court of Appeals was 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.009" offset="8819984">That we have that complied with 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.171" offset="8832627">Now, I don't want to misstate Mr. Webb's position in his motion or his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.458" offset="8853734">He did have a sense or to which, in effect, said this is not a final decision and couldn't become under 54 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.551" offset="8882155">But everything they argue about it before that Court was whether or not we have to comply with 54 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.859" offset="12327393">So far as I know at the present time, I think, the Second Circuit has withdrawn the opinions in which they attack the rule as giving undue power to the trial courts, and I believe the Seventh Circuit couldn't -- well, I can't blame them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.603" offset="12394371">As far as I know, all of the cases in which they have been directly involved, 54 (b) and an application of it are now in favor of the rule and for applying it provided it supplied with proper discretion to a claim which has been settled even though other claims whether it would be called counterclaims, cross claims or what, of course, the alternative.</text>
